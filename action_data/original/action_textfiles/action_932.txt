Percentage survival of the scallops held for one and a half years in the pearl nets (72.7% and 63.9%) was higher than that of those in benthic cages (28% and 32.0%) at both sites and was the case for each sampling date. Mean shell height in the pearl nets (73.0 mm and 69.0 mm) was also higher than that of those in benthic cages (68.5 mm and 52.0 mm) after one and a half years. Pearl nets comprised of drop lines containing ten nets at 3m depth were deployed 4m away from salmon cages at two sites and sampled every four months for eighteen months. Benthic cages of modified lobster traps were deployed 100m away from salmon cages at depth of 10 and 15m at each site. The authors note that growth rates recorded in this trial are comparable with those of scallops grown away from salmon farms.</p><p> </p>",

Between the beginning and end of the 90 day trial, oysters and mussels showed an increase in shell length of 85±54 mm and 152±45 mm, respectively. Analysis of stable isotopes content from the bivalves indicated no relationship between the trophic behaviour of the bivalves and the main input of organic matter from the fish farm (the feed). Growth of the bivalves was not affected by proximity to the fish farm. Oyster (<em>Ostrea edulis</em>) and mussel (<em>Mytilus galloprovincialis</em>) were deployed along a distance transect running from 0 to 1800 m from fish cages containing cultured gilthead sea bream (<em>Sparus aurata</em>) and European sea bass (<em>Dicentrarchus labrax</em>) for 3 months. The bivalves were placed at 15 m depth at 0, 25, 120, 300, 600 and 1800 m from the net cages to assess whether the fish farm influenced their development.</p>",

The absorption efficiencies for the spat formula feed, diatom based salmon feed, salmon faeces (laboratory trial) and total particulate matter at salmon cages were 87, 81, 90, 86, and 54% respectively. In the laboratory experiments, four diets were fed to three size classes of mussels; spat formula diet, diatom based formula diet, salmon feed and salmon faeces over a period of one and a half months. In the field trials, mussels were placed individually in chambers on a moored boat and the outflowfrom the salmon farm was used to measure total particulate matter, total organic matter and organic carbon with collection occurring prior to, and mid-way through each 1.5 h trial. The trials occurred on three separate days. Faecal deposits were collected throughout the trial to determine absorption efficiency.</p>",
