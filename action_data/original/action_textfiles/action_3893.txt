Chemicals can spread easily from farmland into adjacent habitats, either by drifting on the wind during spraying, or by leaching through the soil in water. Physical barriers may be used to reduce the spread of chemicals from farmland on to neighbouring habitats.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on restricting chemical applications next to adjacent habitat, or at the edge of crops, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3894\"><em>Provide buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins, waterways and ponds</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3898\"><em>Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Russell C. &amp; Schultz C.B.
