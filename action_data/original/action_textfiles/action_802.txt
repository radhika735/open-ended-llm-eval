        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Agricultural intensification has resulted in increased use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. Studies have found a relationship between proximity to agricultural lands with high levels of pesticide and fertilizer use and amphibian malformations and population declines (Ouellet <em>et al.</em> 1997; Bishop <em>et al. </em>1999; Davidson 2004; Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2005). As well as direct effects, pollutants such as fertilizers can stimulate algal growth which can have significant effects on aquatic habitats.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Other studies that investigated methods to reduce pollution levels in aquatic habitats in agricultural landscapes are described in ‘<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/771\">Create walls or barriers to exclude pollutants</a></span>’ and ‘<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/832\">Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Bishop C.A., Mahony N.A., Struger J., Ng P. &amp; Pettit K.E.
