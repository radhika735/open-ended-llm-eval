        "background_definitions": "<p>Non-native ornamental plants dominate urban and suburban landscapes. A large number of butterflies and moths have specialist feeding requirements, and can only feed as caterpillars, or occasionally adults, on plants which they have evolved with (Burghardt <em>et al.</em> 2008). Therefore, butterfly and moth species richness often correlates with the number of potential larval host plant species present in urban parks (Koh &amp; Sodhi 2004), and planting more native species may benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths. Moreover, caterpillar growth and survival can vary between different host plant species (Pocius <em>et al.</em> 2017), so the choice of host species for planting may be important.</p>\r\n<p>Note that some non-native plants may still provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths.

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, paired, controlled study in 2013–2014 in a managed park in Georgia, USA (Majewska et al. 2018) found that areas planted with native flowers had a similar overall abundance and species richness of adult butterflies, but fewer adults and/or eggs, and more caterpillars, of specific species than areas planted with non-native flowers. The total abundance and species richness of butterflies was similar in plots planted with native and non-native plants (data presented as model results). However, in native flower plots the abundance of monarch <em>Danaus plexippus</em> (0.1–0.2 butterflies/plot) and gulf fritillary <em>Agraulis vanillae</em> adults (0.3–0.5 butterflies/plot), and of monarch and queen <em>Danaus gilippus</em> eggs (0.1 eggs/plant) was lower than in non-native flower plots (monarch: 1.6–3.1 butterflies/plot; gulf fritillary: 1.3–1.4 butterflies/plot; eggs: 0.7 eggs/plant). The abundance of black swallowtail <em>Papilio polyxenes </em>caterpillars was higher in native plots (0.7 caterpillars/plant) than in non-native plots (0.6 caterpillars/plant). Authors suggested that the difference in the number of butterflies of some species may have been caused by the fact that there were fewer flowering plants in native than non-native plots. In spring 2013, four fenced, irrigated experimental plots (7.6 × 15.2 m, 20–88 m apart) were established in each of three blocks, 250 m apart. Each plot was planted with 128 plants of 13 species, and was surrounded by mown grass. Plots were assigned to four treatments/block: planting with species native to Georgia or not native to the USA, and low (every other month) or high (every other week) weed maintenance. From May–September 2014, adult butterflies were surveyed for 7 minutes/plot, 1–4 times/month, and eggs and caterpillars of the four species were counted weekly or monthly on 2–14 host plants/butterfly species/plot.</p>",
