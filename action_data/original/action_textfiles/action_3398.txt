The average number of pasqueflower <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris</em> seedlings did not differ significantly between plots where seeds were sown (0.6 seedlings/plot) and plots where seeds were not sown (0 seedlings/plot). Two other species, mountain clover<em> Trifolium montanum</em> and prostrate speedwell <em>Veronica prostrata</em>, did not germinate in either sown or unsown plots. In May–August 2007, at each of five sites, 25 seeds of pasqueflower<em>, </em>mountain clover or prostrate speedwell were sown in four 1 x 1 m plots, and in four plots no seeds were sown. All sites were former forest stands that were clearcut and restored to grassland 3–14 years before the study. In May 2008, the number of seedlings in each plot was counted.</p>",
