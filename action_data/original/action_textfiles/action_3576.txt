No loggerhead turtles were caught on non-ringed hooks, compared to six turtles caught on ringed hooks (statistical analyses not carried out due to small sample size). Catch rates of target swordfish were lower on non-ringed hooks (7 fish/1,000 hooks) compared to ringed hooks (9 fish/1,000 hooks). Ringed and non-ringed circle hooks (size: 16/0) with a 10° offset were alternately set along a mainline in an even ratio from six longline vessels (600–1,100 hooks/vessel). Data were collected during 65 longline deployments (using 25,400 of each hook type) in July-September in 2009–2010 and 2012–2013.</p>",
