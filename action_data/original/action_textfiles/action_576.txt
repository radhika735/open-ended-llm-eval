However, no birds were seen after leaving the vicinity of the release site and no successful breeding attempts were recorded between 1992 and 1998. Birds were released at prairie sites in the species’ former range using ‘hacking pens’ (see ‘Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations’) and were fed for 33 days after release. In addition, artificial burrows were used to reduce predation chances and adult owls used as ‘parental models’.</p><p> </p>",
