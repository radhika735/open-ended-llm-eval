A captive gorilla with no experience of nettles gathered and processed leaves 32% of the time and omitted the process stage 59% of the time. As a comparison, captive gorillas given willow plant <em>Salix sp</em>., omitted the process stage 79% of the time and 17% of the time ate the leaves as soon as the willow was obtained. Leaves were offered either inside or as a scatter feed outside. Sixty-eight hours of video contained 296 behavioural sequences of nettle feeding from nine gorillas and 176 behavioural sequences of willow feeding from 11 gorillas.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
