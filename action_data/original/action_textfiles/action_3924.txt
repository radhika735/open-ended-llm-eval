Even if butterflies and moths are not using the crop itself, harvesting disturbs the structure of the field, and may cause mortality of caterpillars living on other plant species within or around the crop. Leaving unharvested strips, known as headlands, at the edge of fields may provide both shelter and a continued resource availability to butterflies and moths.</p>",

In unharvested strips of alfalfa, the abundance (53 individuals/transect) and species richness (4 species/transect) of butterflies was higher than in harvested alfalfa (abundance: 12–15 individuals/transect; richness: 2–3 species/transect) or in conventional wheat fields (abundance: 3–6 individuals/transect; richness: 1–2 species/transect). See paper for individual species results. On each of 24 farms, one alfalfa field was harvested conventionally 4–5 times/year, one alfalfa field had a rotational 7-m strip left unmown during each harvest, and one winter wheat field was managed conventionally. From May–September 2009–2010, butterflies were surveyed visually five times/year on two 200–400-m transects in each field (15–17 farms surveyed/year).</p>",
