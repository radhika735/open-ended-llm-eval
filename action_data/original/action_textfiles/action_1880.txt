In some species, burrows or nests are constructed before the breeding season. Separating the sexes outside of the breeding season allows the males or females time to construct these burrows. The timing of introducing the females to the males alongside could promote breeding.</span></p>",

From 2006-2010 Melbourne Zoo did not separate sexes in the non-breeding period (average clutch size: 18; egg mortality: 89%). In 2011-2012, sexes were separated in the non-breeding period (average clutch size: 43; egg mortality: 89%). At Taronga Zoo sexes were always kept separate in the non-breeding periods in 2010 (average clutch size: 80; egg mortality: 72%), 2011(average clutch size: 70; egg mortality: 26%) and 2012(average clutch size: 54; egg mortality: 28%).</p>",
