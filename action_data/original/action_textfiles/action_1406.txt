(11 visits/sample), compared to other species in peak bloom (0–5), but visits by wild bees did not differ significantly between these species (0.1–1.6). From 10 to 22 July, more honey bees were found on tansy phacelia <em>Phacelia tanacetifolia</em> (28 vs 0–4 visits/sample) and wild arugula <em>Diplotaxis muralis</em> (19 vs 0–4), and more wild bees were found on phacelia (5.4 vs 0–2.4), compared to other species in peak bloom. From 5 to 19 August, more honey bees were found on white borage <em>Borago officinalis</em> (33 vs 0–11 visits/sample), and more wild bees were found on phacelia (6.2 vs 0.1–2.0), compared to other species in peak bloom. From 9 to 23 September, more honey bees were found on borage (10 visits/sample), compared to other species in peak bloom (0–1), but visits by wild bees did not differ significantly between these species (1.0–2.5). <strong>Methods:</strong> Two rows of kale <em>Brassica oleracea</em>, between two strips (four rows) of one flower species, were planted on 16 May in each plot (3 x 6 m). There were five replicate plots for each of nine flower species. Invertebrates were sampled by counting flower visitors (6 minutes/plot, every 5–9 days) or vacuuming plants (15 seconds/plot, 25 x 50 cm area, every 12–15 days).</p><p> </p>",
