        "background_definitions": "<p>Although many species of butterflies and moths are among the most popular insects, others are maligned as crop pests or clothes-eaters, or misunderstood simply because they are nocturnal. Increasing public understanding of the importance and beauty of butterflies and moths can counteract this, reducing the frequency of negative behaviours towards them, or even raising funds for their conservation. On the other hand, some rare species of butterfly and moth are still threatened by collecting, and in this case, education may be used to raise awareness of the species’ plight with the aim of changing behaviour. This action is for studies which test the impact of either type of education programmes on butterfly and moth populations.</p>",
