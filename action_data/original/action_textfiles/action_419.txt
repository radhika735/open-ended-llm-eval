There was no corresponding decrease at five control sites, where only untreated eggs were presented (daily predation rates rose from 3% to 90%). However, a randomised, replicated and controlled paired sites study in July-September 1987 found that egg predation was not significantly different at four experimental sites, where 10 eggs treated with 20-25 mg of emetine dihydrochloride and 10 untreated eggs were placed in set locations twice a week, compared to control sites, where only untreated eggs were provided.</p><p> </p>",

However, it also found that injecting eggs with 1 ml of one of ten volatile chemicals reduced the amount of egg consumed during both first and second exposures, compared to control eggs, for all chemicals except ammonia. However, egg consumption during post-treatment trials was unchanged following treatment and all eggs in post-treatment trials were opened. The ten chemicals tested were: allyl sulphide (garlic), ammonia, capsaicin (chilli pepper), chloroacetophenone (chemical mace), cinnamaldehyde (hot cinnamon), ethyl acetate, isoamyl nitrite (smelling salts), napthaldehyde (mothballs), pulegone (mint extract) and undecanone (commercially available dog repellent). When injected, pulegone, allyl sulphide and cinnamaldehyde reduced the amount of egg consumed significantly more than the other chemicals.</p><p> </p>",

At a colony in Idaho, a trial with 110 repeats of each treatment found that, following a two week conditioning phase, where 45 pulegone (mint extract) injected chicken eggs were distributed and replaced around the colony, neither placing two drops (1 ml each) of pulegone on the edge of gull nests, nor spraying 2 ml of pulegone around the periphery of a nest reduced the number of eggs predated (26-38% of nests with pulegone drops were predated, 25-34% of sprayed nests and 22-37% of controls). At a colony in Idaho and two in California, a trial with 275 replicates found that, after a similar conditioning phase, burying a cup containing 2 ml of pulegone (mint extract) so that its lip was flush with the ground of the nest did not reduce the number of eggs predated, compared to control nests (30-31% predation for treated nests vs. 33-35% for controls).</p><p> </p>",
