In two trials, reptile abundance, species richness and diversity was similar between plots with snags added (abundance: 0.2–0.3 individuals/plot, richness: 5–6 species, diversity: 10–13 Shannon-Weiner index), or all snags and coarse woody debris removed (0.3–0.5, 6–7, 13–17), compared to not manipulating debris (0.3–0.4, 7, 13–17). In the second trial, reptile abundance, richness and diversity were lower when standing snags were added (0.3 individuals/plot, 5 species, 10 Shannon-Weiner index, respectively) compared to when all woody debris was removed (0.5, 7, 17). Snake abundance was higher with woody debris removal compared to snag addition (debris removal: 0.2 individuals/plot; snags added: 0.1), but lizard abundance was not (debris removal: 0.3 individuals/plot; snags added: 0.2). Treatments were randomly assigned to 9 ha plots within three forest blocks in 1996–2001: standing snag addition (10 fold increase), all woody debris removal, downed woody debris addition (five-fold increase), and no manipulation and in 2002–2005: downed woody debris addition, woody debris removal, standing snag addition, and no manipulation. Reptiles were sampled using drift fences with pitfall traps in 1998–2005.</p>",
