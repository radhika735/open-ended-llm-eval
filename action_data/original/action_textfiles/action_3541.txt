Results were not statistically tested, and the effect of the different actions cannot be separated. The percentage of nests lost to poaching was 91% (49 of 54 nests) in October when patrols began; 51% (102 of 199 nests) in November; and 0–2% (of around 500 nests) in December–March. The beach was patrolled nightly for research purposes from October 1991–March 1992. Additional patrols were carried out by rural guards for three weeks in November and December, and periodically during January and February. In October–November 1991, an education and communications programme was carried out with local communities that involved organising trips to see the turtles, the chance to help with turtle research, lectures, lessons, slideshows, and local distribution of a brochure on leatherback turtle biology and conservation. Activities were also carried out with scout groups and the National Museum of Costa Rica (dates not provided).</p>",
