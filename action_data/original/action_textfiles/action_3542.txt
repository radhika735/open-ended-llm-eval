Fishers that accepted jobs on the turtle management project reported that they had stopped harvesting sea turtles as a result. Prior to this, fishers reported that they caught between 25 and 100 turtles/year. In 2006, an initial survey of seven fishers was carried out that assessed how dependent fishers were on the sea turtles and how many they were capturing. Fishers that expressed interest in a Fishers’ Technician Programme were offered positions on the turtle management project. Those fishers that took up positions on the technician programme subsequently reported on their sea turtle harvesting activities (details of reporting method are unclear).</p>",
