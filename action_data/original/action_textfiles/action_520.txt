However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

In 1980, 34 fledglings were produced from a total of 64 eggs and 13 nestlings that were transferred into 26 nests. Eleven reached an age of at least 24 days and one male was seen returning to the study area in 1981 and showing normal yellow warbler behaviour. Incubation and nestling periods in cross-fostered chicks were identical to previously published results for yellow warblers, but survival of cross-fostered chicks was lower than previously published results. In 1978, nestlings and eggs were also transferred to field sparrow <em>S. pusilla</em>, and house wren <em>Troglodtyes aedon, </em>but the results were not provided. This study was used to investigate the possibility of cross-fostering Kirtland’s warblers <em>D. kirtlandii</em>, which was endangered at the time of the study.</p><p> </p>",

Cross-fostering reduced pairing success in great tits (27% pairing success for cross-fostered chicks, n = 11 vs. 95% for controls, n = 20) but not in blue tits (100% pairing success for both cross-fostered and control chicks, n = 17 and 11 respectively) or flycatchers (95% pairing success for cross-fostered chicks, n = 19 vs. 95% for controls, n = 39).
