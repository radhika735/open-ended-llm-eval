This vegetation rots and produces heat which then incubates the eggs. This process requires the vegetation to be damp, meaning that eggs may die in dry conditions. Artificially adding water to the mounds may help prevent this.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

However, watered mounds dried out in late November, the temperature fell and birds abandoned them. Control nests were abandoned around 12<sup>th</sup> November.</p><p> </p>",
