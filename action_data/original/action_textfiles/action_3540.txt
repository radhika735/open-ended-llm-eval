However, it is the responsibility of each participating country to adopt its own national legislation to ensure the regulations are implemented, and in some countries illegal trade continues. Alongside enforcement by exporting countries, importing countries may have an important role to play in developing solutions to mitigate the threat of trafficking and trade in reptiles.</p>",
