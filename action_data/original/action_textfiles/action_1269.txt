Data were collected in July 1997 in three treatment subplots (1×8 m): 95% shaded, 75% shaded and unshaded, in each of five plots, replicated in five sites. Each subplot was planted with 10 seeds of each of 20 native tree species in July 1996-March 1997. In all plots wild sugarcane <em>Saccharum spontaneum</em> was hand-cut three times during the experiment.</p><p> </p>",
