In drier-than-average years, experimental pairs also raised 1.1 extra fledglings to independence (40 days old). However, there was no effect of rodent control on fledgling success in wetter-than-average years. Management in December-March did not increase either measure of productivity. Rodents were controlled with cholecalciferol rodenticide. This study also investigated the impact of supplementary feeding in addition to rodent control, which is discussed in ‘Provide supplementary food to increase reproductive success’ and the success of captive-bred individuals, in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’.</p><p> </p>",
