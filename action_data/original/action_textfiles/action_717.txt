        "background_definitions": "<p>Organic farming is a set of actions that namely involves avoiding synthetic pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers (using organically derived chemicals and materials instead) and is often combined with different crop rotations and farming practices. Studies determining the individual effects of these actions are summarised separately for each action, but studies testing the whole suite of actions together are included here. Ground-dwelling invertebrates (such as ground beetles and spiders) are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps â small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water. Studies refer to âactivity densitiesâ as pitfall trap measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground (and therefore to the type of ground cover too).</p>\r\n<p>This synopsis includes only those studies that experimentally tested organic farming, not those that compared existing organic systems. Experimental studies were typically conducted at laboratory, plot or field scales (17 of 19 studies presented here), but evidence for the effect of organic farming at the farm and landscapes scales (two studies here) is important and future synopses will also include comparative studies. Meta-analyses have found effects on pests and natural enemies can differ between field and farm scales (Bengtsson et <em>al. </em>2005; Garratt <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>\r\n<p>Here we present evidence from 19 of 37 studies experimentally testing organic farming.</p>\r\n<p>Additional references:</p>\r\n<p>Bengtsson J., Ahnstr J.M. &amp; Weibull A.-C.

In organic plots, parasitism occurred on 0-9% of leaves with potato aphids <em>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</em> compared to 0-5% in conventional plots, across all years. Weeds were more widespread in organic than conventional plots for some years and crops, for example in maize <em>Zea mays </em>in 1991 (3.5% vs. 0.5-1.8% ground cover). Plant-parasitic nematodes decreased in organic but increased in conventional plots in 1989-1992. Occurrence of disease and mobile pests was similar between treatments, and the authors suggest that pests may have migrated between the small plots. Organic tomato plots had more tomato fruitworm damage in 1989 and more stink bug (Pentatomoidea) damage in 1992 (1.5% and 11% of fruits damaged, respectively) than in conventional plots (0.0-0.5% and 6-7%), but damage was similar in other years.

An experiment in 2003-2006 found more fungi in year one (2.3 samples with fungus, out of 3 samples/plot) than in year three (1.3-2 samples), but a second experiment in 2004-2007 found the opposite trend (1.8-2.1 samples in year one vs. 2.3-2.4 samples in year three). Different crops were grown in each of the three years. The authors suggest variation between years and within seasons may explain the contradictory patterns in fungus numbers. Organic management practices were applied at one farm for a sequence of cover crops, soybean <em>Glycine max</em> and maize <em>Zea mays</em> (first, second and third years, respectively). Fungi presence was assessed using three soil samples at each of 24 randomly selected locations. Sampling took place on four dates between May and October each year.</p>",

Numbers of predatory mites were also similar between organic (12 mites/100 g soil) and conventional (8 mites) plots receiving reduced tillage. Organic plots with reduced or no tillage had more predatory mites (12-14 mites/100 g soil) than conventional plots with standard tillage (5 mites). Tomato <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em> and maize <em>Zea mays</em> were grown (in 2005 and 2006, respectively) in 0.4 ha plots. Organic management included compost fertilizer application and legume cover crops during winter. Conventional management included mineral fertilizer and bare fallow in winter. Subplots of standard and reduced tillage were tested under both management systems, and no-tillage was also tested in organic plots. Each treatment was replicated three times. Three soil samples were taken per plot at eight sampling dates in 2005-2006.</p>",

Other natural enemy numbers varied with the method of organic farming. Organic plots with bare soil around crops had 2-4 times more small (&lt;8 mm length) predatory beetle (Coleoptera) activity in May and July 2008 than in other organic and conventional treatments (where numbers were similar). Ground beetles (Carabidae) were most frequent in green-manured organic plots (occurring in 50-70% of traps in May 2007 and 2008) but other organic treatments had similar or lower occurrence (5-30%) than the conventional control (25-30%). Cabbage root fly <em>Delia radicum</em> pupae were 2-3 times scarcer in organic than conventional plots, but numbers of fly eggs were similar between treatments. Cabbage was<em> </em>grown under four types of management: high-input organic, low-input organic with green manure incorporated before cropping (creating bare soil around crops), low-input organic with green manure strips conserved between crop rows, and a conventional control. Pitfall traps were used to sample natural enemies during the root fly egg-laying season.</p>",

Another organic treatment, alternating conserved strips of green manure between vegetable rows, had fewer infected insects (averaging 1.3 carcasses/plot) than conventional plots (7 carcasses) in September 2008. There were no differences between organic and conventional plots in other months (June to August) in 2007-2008. Only 17-28% of carcasses were of plant-eating pests, while 47-63% of carcasses were insect predators. White cabbage <em>Brassica oleracea</em> and carrot<em> Daucus carota</em> were grown in three replicate fields, each containing two organically managed treatments with undersowing (receiving different methods of green manuring) and a conventionally managed control. Treatments were applied to eight plots of 10 x 12.5 m in each field.
