        "background_definitions": "<p>Large, supported openings in trawl nets are catch reduction devices consisting of a large slit or hole, held open by floats and weights (e.g. Bigeye) or by supporting frames (e.g. Fisheye). They are typically used in prawn/shrimp trawls with the aim of allowing unwanted fish catch to escape while retaining the target crustacean species. Unlike other escape devices used in prawn/shrimp trawls such as size-sorting grids, these devices work by exploiting the behaviour of fish that are able to swim back and escape through the exit openings. Here, we also include radial escape sections that consist of a section of multiple large rigid openings running around the circumference of the net, because they too enable fish that can swim forward away from the codend to escape through the openings, unlike the prawns/shrimps. Use of large, supported openings in trawls potentially facilitate the escape of unwanted fish, including immature small fish, from the codend. They may also be used in addition to size-sorting escape grids to further increase the overall selectivity of the trawl net by providing another area for fish escape.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence of the effect of this intervention when used in combination with another intervention to reduce unwanted catch in trawl nets is summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) and large, supported escape openings to trawl nets</a>’</em>.</p>",

For seven of eight different designs of escape opening devices, fish catch was reduced by 22–55% in number (with: 74–248 fish/tow, without: 124–422 fish/tow), and by 27–62% in weight (with: 1,127–2,750 g/tow, without: 2,152–5,530 g/tow). One of eight designs had a 50% lower weight of unwanted fish than a net without escape openings (with:1,245 g/tow, without: 2,489 g/tow) but catch numbers were similar (with:177 fish/tow, without: 170 fish/tow). Target commercial shrimp <em>Penaeidae</em> catches were reduced by 5–39% in number (5–35% in weight) across all eight designs of escape opening devices, however three were not statistically different to catches without a device. Data were collected in spring and autumn 1993 during the shrimp fishing seasons from 36 twin trawl deployments (12/area/season). They were done using a net with one of four designs of supported escape openings towed simultaneously with an unmodified net. In the autumn, modified versions of each of the original four escape opening designs were tested in the same way. Escape opening devices consisted of either a single large framed opening or a section of large mesh openings running around the net circumference. Each design also had a mesh guiding funnel inside the net leading to the escape sections (see original paper for full specifications). Fish and shrimp in each codend were identified, counted and weighed in the laboratory.</p>",
