In 2002–4, four chicks were found dead having been covered in slime and suffocating after African giant land snails Achatina spp. (introduced to Mauritius and many other islands for food) moved other them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Snails are deterred from moving over copper due to a reaction between their slime and the metal, and trials in Mauritius showed that Achatina individuals did not move over copper strips. A snail exclusion barrier was therefore tested.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
