Catch rates of olive ridley <em>Lepidochelys olivacea</em> and green <em>Chelonia mydas </em>sea turtles were similar when non-offset circle hooks were used (olive ridley: 19.1 turtles/1,000 hooks, green: 0.3) compared to offset circle hooks (18.9, 0.4). Catch rates of commercially-targeted dolphinfish <em>Coryphaena </em>spp. were similar between hook types (non-offset: 53.1 fish/1,000 hooks, offset: 51.3). Circle hooks (size: 14/0) with and without a 10ᵒ offset point relative to the shaft of the hook were tested during six fishing trips with 42 shallow-set longline deployments (33,876 total hooks, 800 hooks/day) in November–March, 2004–2006. Hook types were alternated along each longline. Humboldt squid <em>Dosidicus gigas</em> was used as bait (approximately 50 x 50 x 250 mm sized pieces). Lines were deployed in the mornings and hauled in after 12 hours. Sea turtle catch was monitored by onboard observers.</p>",

Unwanted sea turtle catch was reduced with non-offset G-style circle hooks (leatherback turtles <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>: 0.3–0.5 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell sea turtles [Cheloniidae spp.]: 0.1), but not offset Gt-style circle hooks (leatherback turtles: 0.7–0.8 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell turtles: 0.1–0.2), compared to traditional offset J-hooks (leatherback turtles: 0.9–1.0 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell turtles: 0.2–0.4). Mortality and hooking location of leatherback turtles was similar between hook types (see paper for details). In August 2008–December 2011, a commercial vessel carried out 202 overnight longline fishing deployments (lines: 55 nm long with 5 branchlines, deployed 20–50 m deep, lit by green lights). Whole squid (<em>Illex</em> spp.) or mackerel (<em>Scomber</em> spp.) were used as bait (one type of bait/line deployment). Three hook styles: 10° offset J-hooks traditionally used in the fishery; non-offset G-style circle hooks; and 10° offset Gt-style circle hooks were alternated every 70–80 hooks along the line in a randomized start order (254,520 total hooks deployed with 42,420 of each hook/bait combination). Unwanted catch was counted and released.</p>",
