        "background_definitions": "<p>Wind turbines, like other large structures, are illuminated at night to alert aircraft to their presence. However, lighting attracts nocturnal moths, reducing their ability to forage as well as causing direct mortality (van Langevelde <em>et al.</em> 2017). The colour or type of lighting used also affects how attractive lights are to moths, with shorter wavelength light (ultraviolet, blue and green) being more attractive than longer wavelengths (red and yellow; van Langevelde <em>et al.</em> 2011). Removing or changing the lighting used on turbines may therefore reduce their impact on moth populations.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on reducing light pollution generally, see “<em>Threat: Pollution</em>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>van Langevelde F., Ettema J., Donners M., WallisDeVries M.F., Groenendijk D.
