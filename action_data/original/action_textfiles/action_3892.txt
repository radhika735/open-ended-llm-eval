This facilitates widespread use over a large area which, even if low level or infrequent, can harm or kill butterflies and moths, and may have contributed to population declines (Gilburn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Using legislation to restrict the sale and application of the most dangerous chemicals could reduce their use, and help threatened butterfly and moth populations to recover.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Gilburn A.S., Bunnefeld N., Wilson J.M., Botham M.S., Brereton T.M., Fox R. &amp; Goulson D.
