        "background_definitions": "<p>Marine Protected Areas are designations for marine sites in which fish (and other marine animals and habitats) conservation can be promoted through management of the fishing activity and other human activities. Many protected areas are ‘no-take’ areas in which no harvesting or collection of marine organisms is permitted by any method. However, some may prohibit almost all harvesting but permit very limited fishing activity (i.e. only one type of harvest activity and/or target species), typically those that are considered to be more selective and have no impact on the bottom habitat. depending on the purpose and the characteristics of the species or habitats intended to be conserved. Ceasing or prohibiting almost all fishing activity may benefit previously impacted populations by allowing them to recover from the effects of fishing over time, whilst allowing the limited use of other resources in the protected area or for it to be used for a specific purpose with potentially little or no impact.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under <a href=\"../../actions/2682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area’</em></a>,<a href=\"../../actions/2674\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Control human activity in a marine protected with a zonation system of restrictions</em>’</a> and <a href=\"../../actions/2680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘<em>Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area</em>’</a>.</p>",

Results were reported only as statistical results (ordination analyses). The authors suggested the lack of increase in fish abundance inside protected compared to non-protected areas was likely due to a lack of compliance and enforcement of the restrictions. In July 1998, two marine protected areas (designated 1997 as voluntary no-take zones where no finfish except salmon could be collected – no gears specified), three research marine reserves (established 1990, extractive activities prohibited except for research, sea urchin fishery closed since late 1970s), and three unprotected openly fished areas were surveyed. Two divers identified and counted fish along 300 m<sup>2</sup> transects on reef slopes up to 20 m deep (4 transects/site).</p>",

Species richness and fish density was lower inside the protected area than outside (species richness: 24 vs 27 species/100 m<sup>2</sup>; density 229 vs 294 fish/100 m<sup>2</sup>) and biomass was similar (inside: 7,900, outside: 8,800 g/100 m<sup>2</sup>). The Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument was established in 2001 to extend the existing Virgin Islands National Park. In the study area, all extractive uses and boat anchoring were prohibited, except for a small area where bait fishing was permitted (no species or gears specified). Annually, in July 2003–2008, protected areas (18–20 sites/year) and fished areas (15–18 sites/year) were surveyed. Divers recorded fish number, length and species along 25 × 4 m belt transects.

Immature pigeye <em>Carcharhinus amboinensis</em> and adult spottail <em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em> were detected inside protected areas an average of 23% (range 2–67%) and 32% (range 0–67%) of time respectively, and for 4–676 days (average 190 days) and 28–566 days (average 281 days). In addition, the amount of time spent inside protected areas was significantly different between sexes for spottail, but not pigeye, with female spottail spending more time (38%) than males (21%). All the tracked sharks left the protected areas during monitoring, on average 0.9 times/day for pigeye and 1.7 times/day for spottail. Sharks were monitored in two marine protected areas in Cleveland Bay (140 km<sup>2</sup>) off the wider Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (rezoned in 2003) in which trawling and netting (bait netting excluded) are prohibited and line fishing is limited to one line per person and one hook per line. Sharks are not targeted by the permitted fisheries and 95% are released alive if captured. From 2009 to 2010, tracking data was collected from 37 sub-adult pigeye and 20 adult spottail fitted with acoustic transmitters by 55 underwater receivers deployed inside the two protected areas.</p>",

Overall average survival probability of cod inside the protected area increased after implementation (after: 0.2–0.4, before: 0.1–0.2) and in comparison with areas outside the protected area (after: 0.2, before: 0.2). Sampling was done in April–July 2005–2013. Cod were captured inside the protected area and at two unprotected sites with fyke nets and tagged and released at the capture location. Data on 10,764 recaptures of tagged fish were used: 1,454 tagged within the protected area and 9,310 tagged in other areas along the Skagerrak coast. Survival was estimated using a model, described in the original paper. The protected area (Flødevigen, 1 km<sup>2</sup>) was implemented in September 2006 and allowed a hook and line fishery and research sampling. At unprotected areas, hook and line, gillnets, fyke nets and other fishing gear types were allowed, but not bottom trawling within 12 nautical miles from the coast, with an exception for small scale coastal trawling for shrimp <em>Pandalus borealis</em>.</p>",
