        "background_definitions": "<p>Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European Union agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity on farmland. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5–20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Unlike fallow land, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing. However, set-aside often is managed by cutting and/or spraying. In some cases, set-aside land has had wildflowers sown on it.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the effect of different actions for managing existing vegetation, see <a href=\"../../actions/3513\"><em>Raise mowing height</em></a>; <em>Habitat restoration and creation – <a href=\"../../actions/3712\">Manage vegetation using herbicides</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3713\">Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing</a></em>;<a href=\"../../actions/3714\"><em> Manage vegetation by hand</em></a> and <a href=\"../../actions/3711\"><em>Manage vegetation using livestock grazing.</em></a></p>",
