For example, sheep graze to a uniform height, while cattle leave heavily trampled areas and eat grass in clumps, leaving patches of taller vegetation (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2008). These grazing patterns encourage different vegetation communities to develop, with different plants dominating. Therefore, grazing with a mix of livestock, rather than just one type, may encourage a more diverse community of butterflies and moths, with individual species preferring the patches created by particular grazers.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies comparing the use of multiple livestock types with single types of livestock.

Heavily grazed plots with both sheep and cattle had fewer invertebrates (4–15 individuals) than plots grazed at high intensity by sheep alone (4–31 individuals). However, when grazing intensity was reduced there was no significant difference in the number of invertebrates between plots grazed by sheep and cattle (9–35 individuals) and sheep-only plots (6–39 individuals). Invertebrate abundance was highest at a fifth plot that was ungrazed (70–223 individuals). From 1989–1991, four experimental grazing plots (1–3 ha) were established. From May–October each year, the number of sheep/plot was adjusted weekly in order to maintain different sward heights (4.5 and 6.5 cm). From June–August, six yearling cattle were also grazed on two of the plots. From 1992, a fifth plot was left ungrazed. In August 1993, invertebrates were sampled from both tussocks and low sward at each of six randomly selected points/plot using a d-vac suction sampler.</p>",

After 18 months of grazing, there was no significant difference in the number of caterpillars on lightly grazed mixed stocking (2.4 individuals/plot), sheep-only (1.9 individuals/plot), ungrazed (2.8 individuals/plot) and commercially grazed plots (2.3 individuals/plot). After 30 months, the number of caterpillars remained similar in the mixed stocking (2.4 individuals/plot) and sheep-only (1.9 individuals/plot) plots, but this was lower than in the ungrazed plots (4.9 individuals/plot) and higher than in the commercially grazed plots (0.5 individuals/plot). From January 2003, three grazing regimes (mixed: sheep and cattle equivalent to 0.9 ewes/ha; sheep-only: sheep at 0.9 ewes/ha; commercial: sheep at 2.7 ewes/ha) and an ungrazed treatment were replicated six times each in twenty-four 3.3-ha plots (in three pairs of adjacent blocks).
