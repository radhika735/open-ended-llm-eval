Success was higher for curlew <em>Numenius arquata </em>(26% of 79 nests vs. 82% of 50), redshank <em>Tringa tetanus </em>(0% of 14 nests vs. 75% of 20) and lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus</em> (29% of 88 nests vs. 75% of 49), but not for golden plover <em>Plucialis apricaria </em>(0% of eight nests vs. 0-54% of 21), snipe <em>Gallinago gallinago</em> (32% of 11 nests vs. 57% of 32) or oystercatcher <em>Haematopus otralegus</em> (0% of 22 nests vs. 29% of 16). Nesting success for golden plover and oystercatcher was higher in a control site with no predator control. The proportion of golden plover nests predated by crows and gulls fell between 1981-5 and 1986-9, but red foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> predated all nests from 1987-9. Carrion crows <em>Corvus corone </em>and common gulls <em>Larus canus</em> were controlled with alpha-chloralose treated eggs.</p><p> </p>",
