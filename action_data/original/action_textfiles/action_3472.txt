        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Transplanting or seeding species’ includes actions taken to attach live organisms at any life stage onto structures, with the aim of generating self-sustaining populations.</p>\r\n<p>Natural intertidal rocky habitats tend to support many more species than do artificial structures (Moschella <em>et al.</em> 2005). Species can be transplanted or seeded directly onto structures with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity. The choice of species to transplant or seed depends on overarching management objectives. There may be value in transplanting rare, threatened, or commercially-valuable species to create artificial surrogate habitats for localized populations. Alternatively, keystone species such as primary producers, grazers, habitat-providers and water-quality regulators may be of interest to create productive and well-regulated artificial ecosystems. Species common to natural reefs may be the focus if, for example, larvae/spores cannot disperse far enough or hydrographic barriers (currents/tides) prevent recruitment, or to pre-empt potential non-native species invasions on new substrates.</p>\r\n<p>When planning transplanting or seeding interventions, the method and timing of intervention and the suitability of the receiving environment should be carefully considered, as these factors may impact the likelihood of success. It is crucial to understand the reasons for a species’ absence in the first place. If, for example, a species has declined due to poor water quality and there has been no intervening improvement, there can be little expectation of successful recovery following transplantation or seeding (Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 1993). Similarly, species that naturally occur in wave-sheltered habitats should not be expected to survive and thrive on wave-exposed structures (Jonsson <em>et al.</em> 2006). Biological factors such as predation pressure, competition and food availability may also affect outcomes and should be understood prior to carrying out the intervention (Gianni <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>There are bodies of literature describing transplanting or seeding species into natural or artificial intertidal habitats to investigate ecological processes and interactions (e.g. Dudgeon &amp; Petraitis 2005; Iveša <em>et al.</em> 2010; Wilkie <em>et al.</em> 2012), for restoration in natural habitats (e.g. Vanderklift <em>et al.</em> 2020) and for artificial reefs (e.g. Walles <em>et al.</em> 2016). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dudgeon S. &amp; Petraitis P.S.
