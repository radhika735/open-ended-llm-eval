        "background_definitions": "<p>Wild primates have to forage over an area that can meet their energetic and nutritional needs. Therefore, an increase in group size will increase the area that must be covered to find adequate food for the group. Individuals in a group that forage in an area that meets the needs of all group members may have to travel further and spend more time and energy foraging than would be the case if they forage in smaller groups or alone (Chapman 1990). Therefore the aim of this intervention is to provide captive primates with the opportunity to forage in subgroups.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
