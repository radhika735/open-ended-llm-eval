        "background_definitions": "<p>Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they benefit the plant with an enhanced supply of nutrients, improved growth and ability to reproduce, and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). They are associated with extensively managed and undisturbed soils. Functional diversity is the value and range of functional roles (or ‘traits’) that organisms play in a given ecosystem (Tilman 2001), in this case the agro-ecosystem. Highly diverse and active soil organisms indicate good soil health. Functional diversity tends to be measured using indexes based on the number of species, or the number of different groups that perform different functions within the ecosystem, for example (there are more). Nematodes play important roles in soil nutrient cycling by feeding on microorganisms. They can be good indicators of ecosystem health as they feed on a wide range of organisms and their community structure reflects the health of their environment.</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett R.
