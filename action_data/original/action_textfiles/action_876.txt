        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Conservation breeding programmes are being used more frequently for threatened amphibian species. However, captive breeding often results in loss of genetic variation. This can mean that animals that were bred for release back in to the wild have reduced fitness. Freezing, or ‘cryopreservation’, of sperm and eggs, allows them to be stored until they are needed. Gene banks can therefore be created for amphibians ensuring that species’ genetic variation is preserved. It also means that the number of a particular species needed in captivity can be reduced and genes can be swapped between captive facilities. Fewer animals in captivity means that fewer amphibians need to be taken from the wild. Freezing can damage cells and so a cryoprotectant, such as dimethyl sulphoxide or glycerol is usually required to protect the cells.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
