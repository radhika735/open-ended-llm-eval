Success was independent of the life-stage translocated/released, number of animals released and geographic region (see paper for details). Releases of captive-bred animals made up 7% of the projects, and individuals involved were adults in 75% of cases, juveniles and sub-adults in 64% of cases and eggs in 4% of cases. The most common reported cause of failure was homing and migration with the second most common reported cause being insufficient numbers, human collection and food/nutrient limitation all equally reported.

Authors reported that post-release survival was higher for skinks released with no mice present (44%) compared to survival of skinks released just prior to reinvasion by mice (15%; see paper for details). Survival of established skinks (2 years after their release) after the mouse reinvasion was higher (91%) than for newly released skinks in the presence of mice (17%). In 2009, a 0.3 ha area was enclosed within a mammal resistant fence (1.9 m high), and 12 captive-bred adult skinks were released in the enclosure following eight weeks in quarantine. In 2011, an additional 16 skinks were quarantined and released. Over a six-month period prior to the release, all mammals inside the enclosure were eradicated using a range of baited traps. House mice reinvaded during 2012 and were again eradicated using live capture traps and poison bait stations. In 2009–2012, starting 7–10 days after release, skinks were monitored every 15 days by a walking survey of the enclosure.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A review published in 2016 of lizard translocation and release projects (some involving captive-bred animals) in New Zealand during 1988–2013 (Romijn &amp; Hartley 2016) found that most projects found evidence of breeding following release, but few found evidence of population growth. Forty-five of 53 (85%) translocations/releases motivated by conservation had some post-release monitoring. Seven found evidence of population growth (more lizards found than released), 33 found that populations were smaller than the number released, at least 16 found evidence of breeding after release, and five resulted in complete failure (no lizards found). One translocation (of <em>Oligosoma infrapunctatum</em>) was later discovered to be to a location outside the species historic range. Some translocations/releases involved wild animals and others captive bred animals (project success vs source of animals not stated). Published and unpublished literature were searched, and key people associated with each project were identified and contacted for further information. Translocations/releases were considered to be motivated by conservation if the primary focus was to benefit the species or recipient site.</p>",
