Reptile species richness was lower in previously cultivated grassland (7 species) than in natural grassland with no rocks (13 species) or many rocks (12 species) in three of four comparisons (other comparison found no significant difference; see paper for details). Total reptile captures was similar in all three grassland habitats (previously cultivated: 31 captures; natural no rocks: 66 captures; natural with rocks: 53 captures). In 2005, a nature reserve was expanded to include three areas of previously cultivated land (18,600 ha in total). One area was last ploughed in 2000–2002; the second was last cultivated in 2002–2003; the third area was ploughed in 2005 to allow for reseeding with indigenous species (details of reseeding not provided). These areas were compared to two areas of natural grassland, one of which had an abundance of scattered rocks. In December 2005–April 2006, a total of nine groups of traps (36 m drift fence, 5 pitfall and 8 funnel traps) were set up in the three habitat types (3 groups/habitat type). Traps were checked daily and all reptiles were identified to species level and rereleased where they were caught.</p>",

Lizards were surveyed using drift fences with pitfall traps (eight traps/plot) over seven consecutive days in June, July and September 2012 (21 trap days/plot).

Results were not statistically tested. Pink-tailed worm-lizards recolonised restored grass and rock plots after nine months (grass and rocks restored only: 4 live lizards and 1 shed skin observed; grass and rocks restored plus prescribed fire and herbicide application: 4 live lizards; grass and rocks restored plus prescribed fire: 2 lizards). There was no evidence of lizards at unrestored sites of poor habitat quality or at sites with grass and rock restored combined with herbicide application only. Four lizards and three shed skins were observed in plots in unrestored, nearby high-quality lizard habitat. In April–May 2014, plots (4 x 4 m) in six sites (150 m apart) were managed by: native grass and rock (30% rock cover) restoration alone; grass and rock restoration with prescribed fire (using a blow torch); grass and rock restoration with herbicide application (Glyphosate, 1:100 glyphosate:water); or grass and rock restoration with prescribed fire and herbicide application. In February 2015, all plots were surveyed for lizards (live sightings and skins) including two unmanaged plots/site (one in poor, the other near high-quality lizard habitat).</p>",
