(1994) placed bundles of reed stems <em>Phragmites australis </em>for cavity-nesting bees (and wasps) in four set-aside fields newly sown with a clover-grass mix. The mix was mostly white clover <em>Trifolium repens</em>, perennial rye grass <em>Lolium perenne</em> and alfalfa <em>Medicago sativa</em>. Four species of bee made nests in the reed stems in these fields, including one endangered species <em>Megachile alpicola</em>. However, in the same study, three of those four species also nested in reed stems placed in barley <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> fields. By contrast, 12 bee species nested in reed stems placed in 2-year-old set-aside fields mown in late June, and 16 species nested in reed stems in old meadows.</p>",

During mowing with a rotary mower and processor (which crushes mowings to accelerate drying), 53-62% of the number of foragers recorded before mowing were found injured, dead or otherwise stuck in the mown grass after mowing. When mowing was conducted without a processor, the average number of bees left dead or unable to fly was reduced from an average of 1.4 bees/m2 (with processor) to 0.2 bees/m2 and many bees were observed foraging or flying away after passing through the mower. The effects of mowing with a processor (but not without) were also tested on a similar-sized plot of <em>Phacelia tanacetifolia</em>, on which bumblebees were recorded as well as honey bees. On average, 0.2 foraging bumblebees/m2 were recorded before mowing, and 'practically' no bumblebees were found in the mown grass.</p>",
