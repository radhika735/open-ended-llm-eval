Results were not tested for statistical significance. Two grasslands managed by rotational mowing maintained heath fritillary populations of 1,300–2,700 adults/year (5-ha site) and 200–600 adults/year (0.25-ha site), compared to six unmanaged grasslands where the heath fritillary populations went extinct (data not presented). From 1981–1989, the flatter areas of a 5-ha grassland were mown annually in autumn using a tractor-drawn ‘bush-hog’ cutter, while the steeper areas were cut every two or four years using hand-held brush cutters. A second 0.25-ha grassland was managed by cutting half of the site each year. Six other grasslands were unmanaged throughout this period. From 1980–1989, butterflies were surveyed annually on timed counts along a zig-zag route covering the known flight areas at each site.

The overall species richness of meadows with refuges (10 species) was similar to standard meadows (8 species). However, species richness of specialist butterflies was higher in meadows with refuges (1.7 species) than in standard meadows (1.1 species). In 2010, at 12 sites (&gt;5 km apart), two meadows (0.3–1.7 ha) which had been in AES since at least 2004 were randomly allocated to two treatments: standard Swiss AES management (no cutting before 15 June) or refuge cutting (no cutting before 15 June and leaving 10–20% of the meadow uncut). The location of the uncut area had to vary between cuts. Meadows were cut on average twice/year. From late April–August 2013, butterflies were surveyed along a transect (65–215 m) through the middle of each meadow. Three surveys were conducted before 15 June, one between 15 June and 15 July, and two after 15 July.</p>",

In rotationally managed meadows, the diversity and species richness of threatened (6–7 species/meadow) and common (10–12 species/meadow) butterflies was higher than in annually mown (threatened: 3; common: 4 species/meadow), annually burned (threatened: 2–3; common: 6 species/meadow) or abandoned meadows (threatened: 1–2; common: 1–2 species/meadow) (diversity data presented as model results). Three meadows were managed traditionally: each year half of the meadow was burned in April and mown in September, while the other half was unmanaged, and management rotated each year. An additional three meadows had been mown annually in April or August for 8–9 years, three meadows had been burned annually for 7–13 years and three meadows had been abandoned (unmanaged) for 6–13 years. From May–September 2012–2013, butterflies were surveyed monthly on three 5 × 30 m plots/meadow.</p>",

The species richness of butterflies was higher in grasslands under mixed management than in mown, grazed or abandoned grasslands, but species composition was not affected by management. However, the species richness of moths was highest in mown grasslands, lowest in grazed grasslands, and intermediate in mixed management, and these sites had different species composition (all data presented as model results). One of four different management practices (mown once/year; grazed by sheep, cattle or deer; abandoned (no grazing or mowing); or ‘mixed’ management) was applied to each of 28 sites (1.5–70.7 ha) for at least five consecutive years. ‘Mixed’ management included mowing different parts of the site at different times, often with patches left uncut for a year, or mowing followed by grazing. From 2007–2010, butterflies and moths were surveyed on &gt;6 visits between April and October in each of two consecutive years to each site.</p>",

Both the abundance and species richness of butterflies on farms with a larger area of in-field AES options were similar to farms with smaller areas of in-field AES options (data presented as model results). A total of 133 farms (17–34 ha, 13–91% arable crops) were managed with in-field AES options, including staggered mowing, use of bar mowers, no silage, undersown cereals, undrilled patches in crops, wide-spaced rows, cover crops and no chemical inputs. Fields without chemical inputs contributed about half of the area of AES options, on average. From May–September 2009–2011, butterflies were surveyed six times on 10–38 transects/farm, totalling 2,500 m/farm. Each transect ran diagonally through a single crop or habitat type, with all available crops and habitats represented. All visits to a farm were completed in a single year, and the species richness was summed across all visits. Total abundance of butterflies was calculated from the number recorded in each habitat, and the availability of each habitat across the farm.</p>",
