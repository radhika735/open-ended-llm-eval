        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition: </strong>‘Reducing the slope’ includes actions taken to reduce the inclination of structures without increasing the footprint, with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity.</p>\r\n<p>The slope of substrate surfaces can influence the species that colonize in subtidal rocky habitats (Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al</em>. 1995; Schroeter <em>et al.</em> 2015; but see Glasby 2000). Artificial structures tend to have steeper slopes than natural reefs, with narrower bands of subtidal habitat. This means that space for organisms is scarce and competitive interactions and other environmental processes differ (Chapman &amp; Underwood 2011). Steep surfaces can also be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Although fundamental aspects of structure designs, such as their slope, are likely to be driven by engineering and cost requirements, there may be opportunities to reduce the slope of subtidal artificial structure surfaces with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity. This may, however, lead to an increase in the physical footprint of structures and associated impacts on the receiving environment (Perkins <em>et al.</em> 2015). For this reason, studies that test the effects of creating additional artificial habitat in front of existing structures to create horizontal or gently sloping surfaces are not included in this synopsis, although such actions can deliver biodiversity benefits and are informative (e.g. Liversage &amp; Chapman 2018; Toft <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of slope on artificial reefs (e.g. Schroeter <em>et al.</em> 2015; Terawaki <em>et al.</em> 2003). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3453\"><em>Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<em><a href=\"../../actions/3443\"> Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structure</a>s</em>;<a href=\"../../actions/3444\"><em> Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3445\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Chapman M.G. &amp; Underwood A.J.
