There were no differences between three different flashing-light treatments. Three tall (&gt; 305 m) towers with non-flashing lights caused significantly more fatalities than any of the smaller towers. The majority of birds killed were night-migrating songbirds but also included gamebirds and woodpeckers.</p><p class=\"\\\"> </p><p> </p>",
