        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Many predators optimise their hunting by searching areas where they have previously been successful. This potentially makes birds nesting in nest boxes vulnerable – they cannot move nesting sites and can lose their clutches year after year if a predator learns their location. Moving nest boxes between years may, therefore, reduce predation and increase reproductive success. This is not the same as translocating birds from an area of high predation to a safer location. Studies describing this intervention are discussed in a separate section within ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Nest boxes moved in 1983 by 50-200 m suffered significantly lower predation in 1984-5, compared to before relocation (1975-83), or to control (unmoved) boxes (40% of five nests predated after relocation vs. 100% of 13 nests before and 83% of six controls). Treatments were reversed in 1988-90: the 14 control boxes moved by 110-370 m and previously moved boxes were kept in the same place. Predation rates on newly moved boxes fell (0% predation for four nests after relocation vs. 77% for 22 nests in 1975-85). No statistical comparison was possible with boxes moved in 1983, as only two nesting attempts were made in 1988-90 (of which one was predated).</p><p> </p>",
