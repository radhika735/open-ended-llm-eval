Management had significant positive impacts on five species in at least region of England, but these effects were often very weak and four of the same species showed negative responses in other regions. The other five ‘hedgerow’ species investigated were never positively associated with boundary management. Generally, effects appeared to be more positive in the north of England.</p>",

Although there were higher numbers of linnet <em>Carduelis cannabina</em> and reed bunting <em>Emberiza schoeniclus</em> (two species known to nest in vegetation at the side of ditches) in plots with ditches managed according to the Countryside Stewardship Scheme and Entry Level Stewardship than in other plots, this difference was not observed for other species also expected to benefit from ditch management, including the yellowhammer <em>Emberiza citrinella </em>and yellow wagtail <em>Motacilla flava</em>. Between 2005 and 2008, skylark <em>Alauda arvensis</em> and grey partridge <em>Perdix perdix</em> declines were greater in plots with lengths of ditch management than other plots. For example, grey partridges showed decreases of 1.3 birds for each 0.08 km of ditch on pastoral farmland. The 2,046 1 km² lowland plots were surveyed in both 2005 and 2008 and classified as arable, pastoral or mixed farmland. Eighty-four percent of plots included some area managed according to the Entry Level Stewardship or Countryside Stewardship Schemes. In both survey years, two surveys were conducted along a 2 km pre-selected transect route through each 1 km² square.</p>",
