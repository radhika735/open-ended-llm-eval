Patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species.</p>\r\n<p>For other options for harvesting timber, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3867\"><em>Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3868\"><em>Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3870\"><em>Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3871\"><em>Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3872\"><em>Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest</em></a>”.</p>",
