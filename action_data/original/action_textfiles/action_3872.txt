        "background_definitions": "<p>Retaining riparian forest buffer strips along water courses or around ponds can help to shield waterways from the negative impacts of tree harvesting, such as sedimentation, by reducing soil erosion. It can also help to mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest butterflies and moths by retaining suitable habitat patches and favourable microclimates. Retained habitat strips can also provide corridors for dispersal through a disturbed landscape (see “<em>Habitat protection – <a href=\"../../actions/3832\">Retain connectivity between habitat patches</a></em>”).</p>\r\n<p>For other options for harvesting timber, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3867\"><em>Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3868\"><em>Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3869\"><em>Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3870\"><em>Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3871\"><em>Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”.</p>",
