There was no difference in the average number of butterfly species (polyculture: 4; monoculture: 3), overall number of individuals (polyculture: 29; monoculture: 36) or the composition of species between oil palm polycultures and monocultures (data presented as model results). Abundances of individual species in polycultures and monocultures were mixed and differences were not tested statistically (see paper for details). At 60 smallholdings oil palms were grown amongst other crops including bananas, coconuts, tapioca and sugar cane (polycultures), and at 60 oil palm was grown alone (monocultures). Smallholdings sampled were ≥300 m apart and mostly &lt;5 ha in size. In January–August 2014, three fruit-baited traps were set ≥50 m apart from each other at each smallholding and operated for 12 h daily for three consecutive days, with regular checking. Butterflies caught were marked before release to avoid recounting. Each smallholding was sampled once.</h4>",
