The number of native plant species/plot was lower in rodent control plots (33) than untreated plots (38). The numbers of non-native plant species/plot (untreated: 4; rodent control: 3) and total vascular plant species/plot (untreated: 40; rodent control: 37) were similar between treatments. Plants were monitored in 400 m<sup>2</sup> plots in each of 14 untreated and 27 rodent control forest fragments. Control was carried out using trap stations, largely for ship rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>and house mice <em>Mus musculus</em>.</p><p> </p>",
