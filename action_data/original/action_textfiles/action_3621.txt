Recovery from a lack of oxygen was similar for turtles that recovered out of water and those that recovered in water as measured by blood lactate (out of water: 18 mmol/l; in water: 18 mmol/l) and pH (out of water: 7.6; in water: 7.7). Out of water recovery resulted in lower reflex impairment compared to immediately after submergence, whereas in water recovery resulted in similar impairment to both out of water recovery and immediately after submergence (reported as impairment index). Wild-caught male turtles were individually submerged in tanks for 12 hours (held with a cage). Blood lactate, blood pH and reflex response were measured immediately after submergence (6 turtles); after 1 h recovery out of water (7 turtles); after 1 h recovery in water (7 turtles). Reflex response included measuring orientation, startle response, escape response and physical response (see paper for details).</p>",
