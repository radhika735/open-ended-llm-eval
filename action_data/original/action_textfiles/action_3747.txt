        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

One female produced a clutch of nine eggs. Three eggs were infertile, and of the six that were incubated, five hatched successfully. Hatchlings survived for at least eight months. In 2010, one female and three male pythons were acquired. They were housed separately and only introduced to each other for breeding. Ambient temperatures were 29–30°C during the day and 22–25°C at night, and a basking spot at 35°C was provided. Eggs were removed and placed in a plastic box with vermiculite (2:1 mix with water) and incubated at 30°C and 90–100% humidity. Hatchlings were housed individually.</p>",
