Restored sites were formerly farmland. Restoration included disking, burning, furrowing, levelling, and spraying with herbicide, and replanting. On each walnut farm, soil samples (10 cm depth) were collected from seven points adjacent to restored or remnant forest and nine points within the walnut orchard, in March 2004. Seeds were germinated and identified in a greenhouse.</p><p> </p>",
