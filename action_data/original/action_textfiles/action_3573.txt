Oil spill emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, should an oil spill occur. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of the response to minimize harmful impacts (Li <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Li P., Cai Q., Lin W., Chen B. &amp; Zhang B.
