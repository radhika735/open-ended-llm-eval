        "background_definitions": "<p>Reptiles that are injured, sick or found in a weak condition are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be treated and released back into the wild. Animals may be injured or weakened due to direct interactions with human threats, for example entanglement in fishing gear, or due to natural threats such as extremes of weather caused by climate change (for example sea turtles may become ‘cold-shocked’ due to sudden severe cold weather). Often rehabilitation is carried out more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation. However, for rare species it may be essential to preserve populations and release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared reptiles. It is also important to note that some of the studies summarized below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are less likely to have been reported.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Seven were seen alive 1–17 months following release and then not seen again, and 11 were not re-seen at all. Tortoises for the release came from a rehabilitation centre. One had been confiscated from the traditional medicine trade, and the others were escaped pets. Twenty-two tortoises were released (11 males, 11 females) in January 2005, five (3 females, 2 males) in December 2006, and a further two females in February 2007. In total, 17 were fitted with radio trackers. Radio tracked tortoises were located monthly for 10 months after release, and then sporadically up to 25 months after release.</p>",

After 3 months, all 12 released rehabilitated tortoises remained within 2 km of their release site and moved similar daily distances (27–38 m/day) to resident tortoises monitored at the same time (34–40 m/day). The authors report that female released tortoises were observed mating with male resident tortoises on several occasions. Twelve radio-tagged Herman’s tortoises were released directly into a national nature reserve (165 ha) in April 2013. The released tortoises were wild individuals that had been rehabilitated and maintained in captivity in a rescue facility in naturally-vegetated outdoor enclosures (7 m x 7 m) for 2–8 years prior to release. Released tortoises were radio-tracked in April–July in 2013. Resident tortoises captured within 0.8 km of the release site were also monitored in April–July using radio-tags in 2012 (9 individuals) and 2013 (14 individuals). All tortoises were tracked daily and behaviours were observed from a distance.</p>",

Autumn-released rehabilitated, translocated tortoises took longer to establish a home range (258 days) than those released in spring (139 days). Rehabilitated, translocated tortoises settled similar distances from release locations regardless of season of release (see original paper for details).
