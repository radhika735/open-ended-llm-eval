The former colony was threatened by port development, so 50 mature trees were relocated 2 km away near approximately 70 existing trees. In addition, vocalisations of the original colony were played, decoys placed in the trees and public access stopped. Before the translocation, the old colony held up to 500 pairs of herons.</p><p> </p>",
