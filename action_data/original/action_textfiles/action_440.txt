        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">If populations are reduced to extremely low levels and are threatened by parasitism, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and remove parasites if they increase to damaging levels. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small. Nest guarding is also used as a response to several other threats, such as predation and poaching and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
