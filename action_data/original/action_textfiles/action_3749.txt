In the tropics, management type affected overall reptile species richness (ecological restoration: 0.9–1.0 species/site, mixed timber plantation: 0–0.4, young monoculture plantation: 0–1.4, old monoculture plantation: 0.1–1.5, natural regrowth: 0–0.4, converted pasture: 0–0.01, old-growth forest: 0.1–2.2) but not abundance (restoration: 9.6 individuals/site, mixed: 2.8, young: 10.4, old: 6.0, regrowth: 0.8, pasture: 0.5, old-growth: 8.8). In the subtropics, management type did not affect overall species richness (restoration: 0–1.0, mixed: 0–0.7, young: 0–0.6, old: 0.2–0.4, regrowth: 0.2–0.4, pasture: 0–0.2, old-growth: 0.4–1.3) or abundance (restoration: 13.6, mixed: 10.7, young: 2.4, old: 1.3, regrowth: 17.6, pasture: 0.3, old-growth: 4.0). Rainforest-specialist species richness varied by management type in both tropical and subtropical regions and were only recorded in restoration plantings, old plantations, and old-growth forest in the tropics and in young and old plantations, natural regrowth and old-growth forest in the subtropics (see paper for individual species results). Reptiles were monitored in ecological restoration plantings (19 sites), mixed timber plantations (15), young monoculture timber plantations (10), old monoculture timber plantations (20), natural regrowth (10), converted to pasture (10), and unmanaged old growth rainforest (20) in subtropical and tropical rainforest.

Similar numbers of reptile species (4 species) were found in restored riparian forest compared to natural riparian forest (data reported as statistical model outputs). The authors reported that species abundant in the restored sites tended to be generalist species (e.g. coast garter snakes <em>Thamnophis elegans terrestris</em>) and that forest specialists (e.g. northern alligator lizards <em>Elgaria coerulea</em>) were present in the natural forest but not in the restored forest. Restoration, which included planting of woody riparian species, commenced between 1996 and 1998. In 1996–1998, a total of 15 ha of woody riparian species and 2.4 ha of freshwater wetland species were planted. Three restored sites (17,400 m<sup>2</sup>, 28,000 m<sup>2</sup>, 65,000 m<sup>2</sup>) were compared to two mature riparian forest sites (47,420 m<sup>2</sup> and 24,780 m<sup>2</sup>).

The effect of burning the removed vegetation and planting native shrubs cannot be separated from the effect of vegetation removal. Over a period of 1–3 years since removal, abundance of the six most common lizards (5 other species detected but not included in analysis due to small sample sizes) remained similar for restored and unmanaged sites (data reported as statistical model outputs). In 2003–2005, four riparian sites each within three regions were selected for non-native vegetation removal (3 sites/region) or no vegetation removal (1 site/treatment). Removal consisted of mechanical removal with chainsaws and herbicide (Garlon) application to stump sprouts. One removal site/region also had all removed vegetation burned, and another also had native shrubs planted. In June–September 2001–2006, abundance of lizards was surveyed at all sites with drift-fencing, pitfall and funnel traps (3 trapping arrays/site, checked 3 times/week).</p>",

Snakes were monitored in 12 sites (20 ha each) in 2000–2006 from three areas of forest (four sites/area).

Trapping surveys indicated that overall lizard abundance was similar in restored stands (127–171 lizards/site/100 trap nights) compared to unrestored stands (62–74), whereas visual encounter surveys found that overall reptile abundance was greater at restored sites (results reported as statistical tests).

Saltcedar in Utah was subject to biocontrol by northern tamarisk beetles <em>Diorhabda carinulata </em>from 2006 (see original paper for details).
