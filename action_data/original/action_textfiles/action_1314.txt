Species richness was similar between treatments in both old-growth (sprayed: 8.7; unsprayed: 8.0 species/plot) and second-growth forests (sprayed: 10.6; unsprayed: 10.5). The same was true for species diversity (Shannon’s index old-growth: sprayed 1.7, unsprayed 1.4; second-growth: sprayed 2.0, unsprayed 2.0). Data were collected in 2005 in 25 sprayed (garlic mustard individuals sprayed with glyphosate herbicide Roundup<sup>©</sup> PRO at the start of winter in 2000-2004) and 25 unsprayed plots (1×1 m). Plots were randomly placed in each of 16 ha second-growth and 20 ha old-growth forest sections.</p><p> </p>",
