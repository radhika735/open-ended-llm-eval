Counts were taken in greenhouses in March, when outside temperatures are too low for bumblebees to survive. After 10 day observation periods in three greenhouses of each type of covering, colonies under the plastic transmitting UV had an average of 86 bees per colony remaining, while colonies under other types of plastic covering had an average of 36 bees per colony. The authors suggest bees escaped through open gutter vents, which they cannot see so easily when there is less contrast (in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum) between daylight and light coming through the greenhouse roof.</p>",

The study showed that nets mounted on the outside of windows with packers (tubes that hold plastic film) or Vinipets (U-shaped devices) prevented bumblebee escape, providing the nets were regularly checked and maintained. Nets mounted on the inside, or on the outside with clips, allowed bees to escape. Double netting of doors, even with a plastic vestibule, also allowed bumblebees to escape, but zipped, netted entrances prevented escape as long as the entrance was weighted at the bottom.</p>",
