The number of predated nests did not differ significantly between those marked with red flags (7 out of 10) and those marked with wooden stakes (10 out of 11). Yellow-spotted goannas <em>Varanus panoptes</em> were the most common predator of nests. In May 2014–June 2015, ten nests were each marked with a bright red canvas flag (30 x 40 cm) mounted on a 1.2 m high stake inserted 50 cm into the sand, 30 cm to the side of the nest. A further 11 nests were marked with only a wooden stake. All nests were visited daily in early December to the end of February 2014–2016 to record predation events.</p>",
