This acidic water can end up in water bodies and have significant effects on aquatic biodiversity including amphibians. Adding uncontaminated ground water to ponds can help to regulate the pH of the water.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Studies that investigated regulating water levels of ponds are discussed in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/833\">Regulate water levels</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
