Mourning doves <em>Zenaida macroura</em> (formerly <em>Zenaidura</em> <em>macroura</em>) made 18 nesting attempts in 59 black nests compared to nine in 62 green nests, but there were four successful attempts in each colour (i.e. 22% success for black nests and 44% for green). The use of the nests (cones of black or green roofing paper 17.8 cm at the widest and 5.1 cm deep) by both species is discussed further in ‘Provide artificial nest sites’.</p><p> </p>",
