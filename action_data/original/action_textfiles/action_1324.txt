Foraging increased from 0% of the overall time observed with old enrichment and low crowd levels to 29% when there were high crowd levels and new enrichment and up to 33% when new enrichment was given with low crowds. Object use was increased from 3% with low crowds and old enrichment to 4% and 5% when new enrichment was given with high crowds and low crowd levels respectively. Researchers filmed the group of chimpanzees for three hours between 12:00 h and 15:00 h with one of four treatments each day: large crowd, new enrichment; large crowd, old enrichment; small crowd, new enrichment; small crowd, old enrichment and low crowd, no enrichment. The group of 11 chimpanzees were given access to the enrichment, browse, ice blocks and stuffed sacks at 12:00 h. Repeated observations were made over five weeks. Scan sampling methods were used to record the behaviour of each chimpanzee every 60 seconds.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
