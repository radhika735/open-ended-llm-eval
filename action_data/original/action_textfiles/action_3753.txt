        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See <a href=\"../../data/index?terms=Breed%20reptiles%20in%20captivity&amp;yt0=\">here for other species groups</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see <a href=\"../../actions/3771\"><em>Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild</em>.</a></p>",

A female produced a clutch of 11 eggs, seven of which hatched successfully. Incubation periods ranged from 93–96 days. None of three eggs that were removed and incubated artificially fully developed. In 2007–2013, two female and two male snakes were held together in an enclosure (3.6 x 2.5 x 2.7 m) with a substrate of gravel, soil and rice husks, with a water source, larger rocks and plants. Temperatures were maintained at 19–28°C and humidity at 75–95%. In February 2013, just prior to the breeding event, humidity was increased to &gt;85%. Three eggs were removed and incubated in a 1:1 mix of vermiculite and water at 24.6–25°C and 77–80% humidity. The remaining eight eggs were left in the enclosure for 74 days, at which point they were moved to an incubator, with temperatures of 24.5–27.7°C and 78–91% humidity.</p>",
