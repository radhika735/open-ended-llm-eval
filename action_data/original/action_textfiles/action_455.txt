Many of these chemicals are now restricted or prohibited, but many others still remain in use. For example, some organophosphates such as monocrotophos are used to control insect pests and have caused mass poisoning incidents in raptors and cranes Grus spp. (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 1999; Pain <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\"> </p>\r\n<p>Goldstein, M.
