One of three breeding attempts for elegant stubfoot toad<em> Atelopus elegans</em> and the one attempt for Pebas stubfoot toad <em>Atelopus spumarius</em> and <em>Atelopus spumarius-pulcher</em> complex resulted in a clutch of eggs. However, most <em>Atelopus spumarius</em> embryos were dead within eight days. This was considered by the authors to be due to a drop in water temperature one night. Three tadpoles survived the first month and just one over four months. Nineteen <em>Atelopus spumarius-pulcher</em> complex toadlets survived over eight months (from 500 eggs). Causes of death were unknown. Twenty adult elegant stubfoot toads, eight Pebas stubfoot toads and 30 <em>Atelopus spumarius-pulcher</em> complex were wild caught. Breeding tanks were 60 x 35 x 30 cm with stones, plants and an open system of filtered water. One of three female elegant stubfoot toads<em> </em>and one Pebas stubfoot toad were stimulated with human chorionic gonadotrophin (0.05 ml).</p><p> </p>",

However, no toadlets survived past day 142. Three breeding trials resulted in no egg production. Following the simulation of a dry then wet season, two clutches of eggs were produced with 400–500 eggs (5–10% unfertilized). On day 43 after egg deposition, only two larvae survived. One tadpole survived to day 112, the other died as a froglet at day 142. Males were housed in three groups of 12–15 in tanks (100 x 60 x 60 cm) with artificial streams. Four females were transferred to the tanks for breeding. Tanks were misted several times each day. A dry season with reduced water and misting was then simulated for three months followed by a wet season with increased water and misting.</p><p> </p>",
