The number of species increased following girdling (before: 5-9; after: 7-12/1 m<sup>2</sup> plot) and remained similar in uncut plots (before: 5-10; after: 6-12). Species diversity increased following girdling (Shannon's index before: 0.8-1.1; after: 1.2-1.7) and remained similar in uncut plots (before: 0.7-1.3; after: 0.8-1.5). Plant cover increased following girdling (before: 80%; after: 100-120%) and remained similar in uncut plots (before: 90-100%; after: 90-120%). In 1992, girdling (cutting &gt;1 cm deep cuts around the trunks of all conifers) and uncut treatments (100 m<sup>2</sup>) were replicated in three blocks (&gt;625 m<sup>2</sup>) at each of two sites. Data were collected before (1992) and after treatments (2003) in 5-12 plots (1 m<sup>2</sup>) in each treatment.</p><p> </p>",
