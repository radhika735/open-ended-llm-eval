Coarse fish include species such as common carp <em>Cyprinus carpio</em> which are typically stocked at high levels for recreational fishing. These species may have a negative impact on aquatic wildlife through competition for resources, predation and damage to habitats. Removal of coarse fish may benefit wildlife including waterbirds by reducing competition (Phillips 1992).</p>\r\n<p class=\"StyleSynopsisBodyTextItalic\">Phillips V. E.
