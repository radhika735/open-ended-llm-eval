        "background_definitions": "<p>In conventional farming, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control or fertilization, but these can have lethal or sub-lethal effects on farmland wildlife, including butterflies and moths (Russell &amp; Schultz 2010, Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2016). Chemicals can spread easily from farmland into adjacent habitats, either by drifting on the wind during spraying, or by leaching through the soil in water. Providing buffer strips with reduced or no chemical applications may reduce run-off into neighbouring habitats, as well as providing additional habitat in their own right.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on restricting chemical applications at the edge of crops, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3898\"><em>Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)</em></a>”.

In AES water margins, the abundance of micro-moths (113 individuals) and all macro-moths (498 individuals), and of declining macro-moths specifically (65 individuals), was higher than in conventionally-managed water margins (micro-moths: 58 individuals; all macro-moths: 236 individuals; declining macro-moths: 27 individuals). However, the species richness in AES margins (micro-moths: 25; all macro-moths: 48; declining macro-moths: 7 species) was not significantly different from conventional margins (micro-moths: 24; all macro-moths: 44; declining macro-moths: 12 species). In 2004, seventeen farms enrolled in AES, and were paired with 17 similar but conventionally-managed farms, &lt;8 km away. On AES farms, &gt;3-m-wide margins were established next to water bodies, and managed with restrictions on fertilizer and pesticide use, mowing and grazing. Margins on conventional farms had no management restrictions. From June–September 2008, moths were collected for four hours, on one night/farm, using a 6 W heath light trap located next to one margin on each farm. Paired farms were surveyed on the same night.</p>",
