Turtle catch rates and species composition were similar between floated (0.06 turtles/hour, 35 individuals) and submerged nets (0.10 turtles/hour, 48 individuals). Blood lactate levels (a measure of drowning risk) were reduced in turtles tested in floated nets (1.3–3.5 mmol/L) compared to submerged nets (13.2–16.4 mmol/L). Turtle mortality only occurred in submerged nets (3 individuals, no statistical tests were carried out). Species composition was similar between net types (data presented as statistical model outputs). Turtle species caught included painted turtles <em>Chrysemys picta</em>, eastern musk turtles <em>Sternotherus odoratus</em>, northern map turtles <em>Graptemys geographica</em>, and common snapping turtle <em>Chelydra serpentina</em>. Target fish catch rates were similar between floated (2.5 fish/hour) and submerged nets (3.1 fish/hour). In August 2009, experimental tests of blood lactate and pH levels of turtles placed in submerged, floated and semi-submerged nets were carried out initially to test whether turtles used air spaces provided by elevating nets in the water (9–10 trials/net, see original paper for details). In April–June 2010, submerged nets (without floats) and nets with floats were deployed in pairs (two submerged nets deployed within 15 m of two floated nets) for 8–48 hours in 30 locations (1–2 m deep). Blood samples were taken from all turtles and the number caught (including mortalities) was recorded.</p>",

Reduced-buoy nets caught fewer sea turtles (0.06 turtles/100 m of net/day) compared to standard nets (0.19 turtles/100 m of net/day). Unwanted catch included loggerhead <em>Caretta caretta</em>, green turtle <em>Chelonia mydas</em> and olive ridley turtles <em>Lepidochelys olivacea</em>. Average catch of target fish species was similar in both net types (reduced-buoy: 10; standard: 12 kg/100 m of net/day) although the market value of target fish was lower in reduced-buoy nets ($18/trip) compared to standard nets ($25/trip). Reduced buoy nets (1 buoy/8.5 m net) and standard nets (1 buoy/1.7 m net; both net types were 111–120 m long and 4–6 m high) were deployed in pairs for 21–25 hours at a time during summer 2007 (40 deployments), 2008 (40 deployments) and 2009 (96 deployments).
