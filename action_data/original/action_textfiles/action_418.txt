There was no corresponding reduction in consumption of green eggs at sites where they were not treated with Landrin. Sites where 12.5% of green eggs were treated had intermediate levels of predation (100% sites: 7.8 attacks/day before treatment vs. 1.2 attacks/day after provision of Landrin-treated eggs; 50% sites: 5.6 vs. 1.4; 12.5% sites: 6.0 vs. 3.4; control sites: 7.6 vs. 7.2). At 50% sites, crows also stopped predating un-dyed eggs and consumption was reduced at 12.5% and 100% sites but remained unchanged at control sites. Post-test trials (when green eggs were again distributed but did not contain Landrin) in 1986 found that crows resumed predation at 100% sites but not at 12.5% or 50% sites. Further tests in 1987 found that crows at all sites except 50% ones resumed predating green eggs.</p></div>",

Topically applying methyl anthranilate to the outside of eggs (alone or in conjunction with injecting 18 mg of methiocarb) reduced consumption compared to other treatments (injection of 18 mg of Carbachol or methiocarb or 18 mg methiocarb plus 100 mg methyl anthranilate). Post-treatment tests with untreated eggs found that only crows from the topical methyl anthranilate groups did not consume eggs on the first day following treatment stopping (only two of 12 birds from these two groups resumed consumption in the post-treatment phase, although seven others moved but did not eat eggs). In a separate experiment, 16 crows in two groups were given eggs injected with either 30 mg methiocarb or 40 mg carbachol for five days. These crows consumed more eggs than those exposed to topical methyl anthranilate treated eggs, but fewer than other previous treatments. Five of eight crows exposed to 30 mg methiocarb and three of eight exposed to 40 mg carbochol ate eggs in the post-treatment test period.</p><p> </p>",

A follow-up experiment found that one of the eight raven pairs previously conditioned to avoid quails’ eggs resumed predation of eggs (both treated and control eggs) when they were placed in a simulated Californian least tern <em>Sterna antillarum browni</em> colony. A further experiment found that when methiocarb-treated eggs were presented at ten sites within three least tern colonies in 1992, a total of 20 eggs were removed or broken over 1,450 ‘egg days’ and no tern eggs were predated by ravens at any of the colonies in 1992.</p><p> </p>",

Birds showed a preference for controls over aminoacetophenone-treated chicks on one day (nine choosing controls vs. two choosing treated chicks). On all other days there was no difference in preference for treatment or control chicks. The total amount of food consumed was highest for control kestrels, intermediate for those fed on aminoacetophenone-treated chicks and lowest for those fed methyl anthranilate-treated chicks, however, kestrels did not appear to lower consumption to the point of threatening body condition: there were no significant differences between kestrel weights at the end of the trial. A further replicated, randomised and controlled experiment found that treating cockerels with the two chemicals <em>and </em>dyeing them either green or blue greatly reduced food intake. However, there was no difference between consumption of dyed and treated chicks and controls that were only dyed, suggesting that aversive conditioning was not occurring.
