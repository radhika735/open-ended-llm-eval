Rafters are split tree trunks, erected on poles at an angle of 15-35° to the horizontal. A trial of 507 rafters erected by beekeepers in U Minh Forest, Minh Hai Province (Tan <em>et al. </em>1997), showed that occupancy by bees was significantly higher when the open space in front of the rafter was very large, over 25 m in diameter (85% and 92% of rafters occupied in dry and rainy seasons respectively, compared to 33-51% for open spaces from 3 to 25 m in diameter).</p>",
