Nineteen colonies were given sucrose-honey syrup containing the organophosphate insecticide acephate at 250 ppm (mg/l), at feeding stations 10 m away from the experimental hives during April 1988. 13 colonies died within three days. In six treated colonies and two control colonies, the queen bee survived or was replaced and the colony survived. Treatment lasted for 30-40 minutes before foragers became poisoned. No other insects were observed visiting the bait.</p>",
