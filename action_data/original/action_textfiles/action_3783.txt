        "background_definitions": "<p>Reptile nests/eggs may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an alternative suitable natural setting where the threat is lower or non-existent. Consideration must be given to the potential impacts of different environmental conditions in the destination location (for example temperature and humidity) on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings (Warner &amp; Andrews 2002, Booth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: <a href=\"../../actions/3781\">Sea turtles</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3782\">Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked &amp; softshell turtles</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3769\">Snakes &amp; lizards</a> or <a href=\"../../actions/3784\">Tuatara</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This action does not include studies on the effect of relocating nests/eggs to on-beach hatcheries, which are designated locations on a beach that are often fenced and patrolled, and where larger numbers of nests/eggs tend to be reburied at relatively high densities. Studies on the effect of moving eggs to on-beach hatcheries are discussed in <em>Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery</em>.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the effect of relocating eggs into artificial settings, including in polystyrene boxes and other containers, see <a href=\"../../actions/3799\"><em>Relocate </em><em>nests/eggs for artificial incubation</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the threat to nests, practitioners may consider other actions such as <em>Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – <a href=\"../../data/index?terms=Protect%20nests%20and%20nesting%20sites%20from%20predation&amp;yt0=\">Protect nests and nesting sites from predation</a></em> and <em>Threat: Biological resource use – <a href=\"../../actions/3541\">Patrol or monitor nesting beaches</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../../actions/3764\"><em>Alter incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratio</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Booth D.T.
