        "background_definitions": "<p>Land under power lines offers a number of conservation opportunities. Management must maintain early successional habitats by suppressing the growth of woody species, to prevent interference with the electric lines. This could have benefits for butterflies and moths, which often favour these lightly disturbed habitats (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 2005). In addition, by running across the landscape, power lines may provide connectivity between other patches of suitable habitat. However, the methods used to control vegetation – primarily herbicide application or cutting – may affect the quality of the habitat created (Smallidge <em>et al.</em> 1996), while the frequency of management may be important for maintaining stretches of habitat in optimal conditions (Ravenscroft 2006).</p>\r\n<p>For other studies on retaining or managing habitat connectivity along linear features, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3854\"><em>Restore or maintain species-rich grassland along road/railway verges</em></a>” and “<em>Habitat protection – <a href=\"../../actions/3832\">Retain connectivity between habitat patches</a></em>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Forrester J.A., Leopold D.J. &amp; Hafner S.D.
