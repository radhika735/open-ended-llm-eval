        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">In wooded habitats, control or removal of understorey and/or midstorey vegetation may be undertaken as a deliberate conservation management practice, for example to restore previously naturally occurring open woodland conditions that have been lost due to active fire suppression and/or declining populations of large mammal grazers and browsers. In terms of bird conservation, such practice may aim to improve habitat conditions to maintain and enhance populations of individual endangered species. However, such changes may make habitat unsuitable for other species.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Many studies (especially in pine forests and savannas) simultaneously control vegetation and introduce a prescribed burning regime. These studies are described in detail in ‘Use prescribed burning’. Studies that describe the impact of mid- and understorey vegetation removal in open pine woodlands, which form a continuum with pine savannas are discussed below.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
