        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition: </strong>‘Reducing the slope’ includes actions taken to reduce the inclination of structures without increasing the footprint, with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity.</p>\r\n<p>The slope of substrate surfaces can influence the species that colonize in intertidal rocky habitats (Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al</em>. 1995; Vaselli <em>et al.</em> 2008; but see Cacabelos <em>et al.</em> 2016; Firth <em>et al. </em>2016). Artificial structures tend to have steeper slopes than natural reefs, with narrower bands of intertidal habitat. This means that space for organisms is scarce and competitive interactions and other environmental processes differ (Chapman &amp; Underwood 2011). Steep surfaces can also be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Although fundamental aspects of structure designs, such as their slope, are likely to be driven by engineering and cost requirements, there may be opportunities to reduce the slope of intertidal artificial structure surfaces with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity. This may, however, lead to an increase in the physical footprint of structures and associated impacts on the receiving environment (Perkins <em>et al.</em> 2015). For this reason, studies that test the effects of creating additional artificial habitat in front of existing structures to create horizontal or gently sloping surfaces are not included in this synopsis, although such actions can deliver biodiversity benefits and are informative (e.g. Liversage &amp; Chapman 2018; Toft <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3462\"><em>Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3463\"><em> Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3464\"><em> Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3465\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Cacabelos E., Martins G.M., Thompson R., Prestes A.C.L., Azevedo J.M.N. &amp; Neto A.I.

Over 24 months, the abundances of macroalgae, oysters and mobile invertebrates were similar on surfaces of a new sloping seawall and on remnants of the original vertical wall that it replaced (data not reported). The slope of a seawall was reduced by replacing a vertical concrete wall with a sloping wall of boulders. This increased the extent of the intertidal area from high to low shore by 2–3 m (timing and other details of the intervention not reported). Macroalgae and invertebrates were counted on 10 surfaces (dimensions not reported) in each of four sites on the new sloping wall, and 10 on a remnant of the original vertical wall, during low tide over 24 months.</p>",

It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of reducing the slope of the seawall or creating rock pools. The slope of a sandstone boulder seawall was reduced during reconstruction in July 2012 (details not reported). Three large rock pools (area: 2 m<sup>2</sup>; depth: 300 mm; volume: 600 l) were also created on the wall.
