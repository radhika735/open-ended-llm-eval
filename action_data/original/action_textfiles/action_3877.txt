        "background_definitions": "<p>Although many species of butterflies and moths are found in woodland, most prefer areas with open glades or a sparse understorey, where light can penetrate and enable flowering plants to grow, as well as providing areas for basking. One option for opening up dense areas of woodland is to use prescribed burning. Although destructive in the short-term, with likely loss of butterflies and moths through direct mortality or reductions in food availability (Glaves <em>et al.</em> 2013), burning may have long-term benefits by creating a more favourable, open habitat (Bubová <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New <em>et al.</em> 2010), and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.</p>\r\n<p>For studies using prescribed burning in naturally open habitats, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3882\"><em>Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats</em></a>”.

One species, the checkered white <em>Pieris protodice</em>, was only found in the restored forest, but another, the California sister <em>Limenitis bredowii</em>, was only found in the unrestored forest.

Butterfly species richness was similar between plots that had been burned and plots that had not, and between plots before and after they were burned (data presented as model results). Additionally, the difference in butterfly community composition between two years in which plots had been burned was similar to between two years in plots which had not been burned in the first year but had been burned in the second year (data presented as community composition indices). Five plots (7–17 ha each) were burned in October 1996 or April 1997 and surveyed in 1997–1998. Two of the burn plots had paired unburned plots, similar in size, topography and pre-burning vegetation, but they too were burned in November 1997 and became burn plots thereafter. Five additional unburned plots (55–127 ha each) were surveyed in 1996–1998. In survey years at each plot, butterflies were identified via walking transects every two weeks from June–September.</p>",

One week after burning, 580 caterpillars were counted at the western colony (numbers for the eastern colony not provided), indicating some had survived the fire. By the following spring, caterpillars were found in both the burnt and unburnt patches but in lower numbers than in the previous year (data not provided). In the spring and summer following the burning, adult butterflies were found in both burnt and unburnt areas of both sites, but at one site (the eastern colony), they were mostly concentrated in the unburnt areas. Two forested sites with populations of the Eltham copper were partially burned in April 1998 (50% of the eastern colony and 75% of the western colony). Individual Bursaria spinosa plants (the sole larval food plant), on which caterpillars had been found prior to burning, were marked and avoided by the burning. Burning was planned for as late as possible in the summer to increase the likelihood that caterpillars would be well-fed and not suffer from the removal of vegetation prior to overwintering. Numbers of caterpillars and butterflies were surveyed at the two sites a week after the fire and in the following spring and summer (further survey timings not provided).</p>",

Butterfly species diversity was 0.5–8 times higher in the burned habitats than the unburned habitats (see paper for details). In Oregon, five upland forest patches were burned once between 1991 and 1997, and five patches were unburned since at least 1978. Five wide, shaded, corridors of thinned vegetation (“fuel breaks”) were burned and four were unburned (no dates given). In California, five upland forest patches were burned once between 1980 and 1998, and seven patches were unburned. Four riparian strips were burned once from 1986–1998, and five strips were unburned (no date given).

These results were primarily due to the abundance of species of blue (Lycaenidae) and white (Pieridae) butterflies (see paper for details).
