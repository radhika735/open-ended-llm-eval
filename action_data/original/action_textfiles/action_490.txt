Burrows with small (10 cm diameter) tunnels were also preferred, compared to those with large (15 cm diameter) tunnels (30 burrows with small tunnels occupied vs. 14 with large burrows, 72 of each type available). However, there were no differences in reproductive output between nest types. Burrows were arranged in clusters containing all burrow types and designed to resemble natural nests. Chambers were lined with soil and natural burrows nearby were blocked with rocks to ensure owls used artificial burrows.</p><p> </p>",

A total of 120 nest boxes were provided, 50 for boreal owls and 70 for Sichuan wood owls. No boreal owls used nest boxes in 2002, four bred in 2003 (fledging eight chicks from three nests) and six bred in 2004 (fledging eight chicks from four clutches). Several species of songbird also use boxes. Boxes were erected at least 3 m up on tree trunks, lined with grass and mosses and of the same design as used in Europe for Ural owls. From 2003, some were encased in bark to make them appear more natural.</p><p> </p>",

All occupied boxes were on a single site with a high owl density and were on artificial structures, although boxes were equally distributed on trees and artificial structures. No nest boxes were used in 2000, possibly because they were erected after birds had settled for the year (boxes erected between January and March). Boxes were made from 39 cm diameter PVC piping with the ends blocked (one only partially, leaving half the end as an entrance hole) and drainage holes drilled in. Boxes were placed 2.5-6.8 m above the ground.</p><p> </p>",
