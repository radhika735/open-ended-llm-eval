Forests naturally undergo disturbances such as storms and lightning that can create open patches. Similarly, group selection harvesting and thinning are harvest methods designed to reduce the density of trees within a forest, without removing substantial areas of canopy cover, and may create a mix of different habitats which suit different species of butterflies and moths.</p>\r\n<p>Note that by thinning, rather than felling a whole forest, larger areas would need to be managed in order to achieve the same timber harvest, though some degree of forest cover can be retained over that area.</p>\r\n<p>For other options for harvesting timber, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3867\"><em>Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3869\"><em>Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3870\"><em>Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3871\"><em>Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3872\"><em>Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest</em></a>”.</p>",

One year after harvesting, there was no significant difference in the number of moth species between stands subjected to group-selection harvesting (40 species), single-tree harvesting (39 species) or shelterwood harvesting and clearcutting (46 species, data not separated), but all harvested stands had fewer species than unharvested stands (56 species). One year before harvesting, all stands had a similar number of moth species (group-selection: 100; single-tree: 85; shelterwood/clearcutting: 96; unharvested: 90 species). In 2008, forest stands (3–5 ha, 150–350 m apart) in three watersheds (500 ha, 10 km apart) were logged. In one watershed, four stands were harvested by group-selection (80% of trees removed) and four stands had random single trees removed. In a second watershed, three stands were shelterwood harvested (15% of trees removed), two stands were clearcut (100% of trees removed), and three stands were unharvested (no trees removed). In the third watershed, all four stands were unharvested. All stands had been clearcut around 60 years earlier. From June–August 2007 and 2009, moths were surveyed every 14 nights (five times/year) from 8pm–7am using a black-light trap placed 2 m above the ground in the centre of each forest stand.</p>",

Three years after group-selection harvesting, the total number of moth species (52 species/stand) was similar to after clearcutting (48 species/stand), and both were lower than before harvesting (group-selection: 100; clearcutting: 98 species/stand) or after shelterwood harvesting (73 species/stand). After group-selection harvesting, the number of specialist species (8 species/stand) was lower than before harvest (19 species/stand), or after shelterwood harvesting (23 species/stand).

One–six years after management, the species richness of macro-moths in thinned areas (40–68 species/site) was higher than in patch-cut (30–52 species/site) or clearcut (34–54 species/site) areas, and was similar to shelterwood harvested (53–75 species/site) and unharvested areas (56–84 species/site). Before harvesting, all areas had similar species richness (thinned: 84; patch-cut: 99; clearcut: 96; shelterwood: 95; unharvested: 90 species/site). However, after management, the total species richness in the thinned and patch-cut block was 122–162 species, compared to 144–190 species in the shelterwood and clearcut block, whereas before management richness was similar (thinned/patch-cut: 203; shelterwood/clearcut: 198 species; statistical significance not assessed). Two ~100 ha regenerated forest blocks were managed in autumn 2008. In one “uneven-aged” block, two 2.0-ha, two 1.2-ha and four 0.4-ha areas were patch-cut, and the remaining area was thinned by single-tree selection. In one “even-aged” block, two 4.1-ha areas were clearcut, two 4.1-ha areas were shelterwood harvested (midstory and understory cleared), and the remaining area was not harvested. From May–August 2007 and 2009–2014, macro-moths were sampled on five nights/year (once/fortnight) using 12 W black-light traps. Traps were placed in the centre of 16 patches: four patch-cut and four thinned sites within the uneven-age block, and two clearcut, three shelterwood and three unharvested sites within the even-age block. Species represented by fewer than three individuals were excluded.</p>",
