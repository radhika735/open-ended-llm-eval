Using magnets as the deterrent, overall bait attack and removal times by dogfish were not significantly different compared to the inert metals (magnet: 1–5 min, inert: 1–2 min). However, dogfish showed strong behavioural avoidance responses (flinch, disorientation) to both the deterrent materials, but not to the inert metals. For halibut, there were no responses to the either the deterrent materials or the inert metals, and bait removal times were similar (deterrents: &lt;1–30 min, inert: &lt;1–30 min). In 2006, two types of potential deterrents (non-magnetic mischmetal alloy and magnets) and an inert stainless steel/aluminium material were tested separately on 12 dogfish and 16 halibut held in indoor pools. Each material was suspended on a short section of twine above pieces of squid <em>Loligo opalescens</em> bait (no hooks). Deterrent/baits were presented simultaneously in pairs with the inert/bait material and behavioural responses recorded by video.

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, controlled study in 2014 in shallow inshore waters in the Tasman Sea off Tasmania, Australia (Westlake <em>et al</em>. 2018) found that the presence of magnets reduced feeding attempts on bait by draughtboard sharks <em>Cephaloscyllium laticeps</em>, compared to bait without magnets. When magnets were present, sharks made 25 and 19 feeding attempts (for two and four magnets respectively), and 53 attempts were made with no magnets. The bait was approached but no feeding was attempted 174 times with two magnets present, 144 times with four magnets present and 123 times with no magnets present. A total of 12 trials were carried out on separate occasions between August–December 2014, each with the following three treatments placed 20 metres apart: two or four magnetic resin blocks attached to rods 0.2 m either side of jack mackerel <em>Trachurus</em> <em>declivis</em> bait, and two non-magnetic blocks on rods either side of the bait. Each device was placed on the seabed and recorded by video for 90 minutes.</p>",
