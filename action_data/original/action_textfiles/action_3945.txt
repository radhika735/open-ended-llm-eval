        "background_definitions": "<p>In the absence of wild or domestic grazing animals, mowing or haying can be used to maintain open grasslands or savannas, and prevent scrub encroachment. However, mowing causes a sudden change in the habitat structure, removing nectar plants and potentially injuring or killing eggs, caterpillars or pupae living within the sward (Humbert et al. 2010, Morris 2000). The timing and frequency of mowing may be important for avoiding these short-term negative impacts on butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). This action includes studies comparing different mowing regimes, as well as studies comparing mowing to other options for grassland management, such as burning.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the creation or restoration of grasslands by either <em>multiple actions</em> (which may include mowing) or where the <em>specific action is not clear</em>, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3943\"><em>Restore or create grassland/savannas</em></a>”.

In the year following haying, the abundance of prairie specialist butterflies (81 individuals/hour) was higher than two years after haying (68 individuals/hour), and both were higher than at sites the year after burning (2 individuals/hour), or two years after burning (21 individuals/hour). However, generalist and migrant species were less abundant at hayed sites (6–19 individuals/hour) than burned sites (18–24 individuals/hour). See paper for individual species results. Among 42 sites (6–571 ha), some were primarily managed by summer haying on a 1–2 year rotation with occasional cattle grazing, and some were managed by cool-season fire covering 5–99% of the site. In June 1992–1993, butterflies were surveyed at least once/year at most sites, either along a transect (35 sites) or from a single point (7 sites, recording only regal fritillary <em>Speyeria idalia</em>). Transects were sub-divided by the most recent management. Sixteen species observed &gt;49 times and at &gt;5 sites were included, and divided into “prairie specialists” (only found on prairies), “grassland species” (found in prairies and other grasslands), “generalists” (found in grasslands and other habitats) and “migrants” (only present in the study area during the growing season).</p>",

On three summer mown grasslands, the density of Karner blue (46–111 individuals/ha) was similar to three summer burned (36–213 individuals/ha) and three unmanaged (43–119 individuals/ha) grasslands. Nine restored oak savannas were burned on average every 3.5 years for 19–33 years prior to 1993. In winter 1993–1994, woody vegetation was removed with chainsaws on three grasslands, and these sites were then cut with a rotary mower in August 1994. In July 1994, three grasslands were burned. Three control grasslands received no mowing or burning. In July–August 1993–1997, butterflies were surveyed three times/grassland/year (&gt;7 days apart) along transects placed 15 m apart.</p>",

One–two years after mowing in August, the number of hog’s fennel <em>Peucedanum officinale </em>plants showing signs of caterpillar feeding was lower than before mowing (0.26–0.29 fewer plants/m<sup>2</sup>). However, the number of plants with feeding signs after mowing in November was not significantly lower than before mowing (0.10–0.24 fewer plants/m<sup>2</sup>). In unmown areas, the number of plants with feeding signs was not significantly different one (0.04 fewer plants/m<sup>2</sup>) or two (0.10 more plants/m<sup>2</sup>) years after mowing at the other sites compared to before mowing. A grassland behind a sea wall was divided into three blocks, each sub-divided into three 84-m<sup>2</sup> areas. In 2000–2002, areas were either mown with a tractor-drawn mower in late August, cut with a hand-held strimmer in November, or left unmown. Grass was cut to 10 cm with the cuttings left on site. No mowing had been conducted for &gt;5 years prior to the experiment. In May–August 2000–2002, caterpillar feeding signs were recorded monthly on plants in two randomly-placed 1-m<sup>2</sup> plots/treatment.</p>",
