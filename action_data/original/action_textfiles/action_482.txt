Clutch size and nest success were similar on and off platforms, but significantly more goslings hatched in platform nests (average of 3.6 goslings/clutch for 49 nests on platforms vs. population average of 3.1 goslings/clutch for 1,113 nests). Platforms consisted of a wooden tray 76 cm x 66 cm, 15 cm deep and filled with soil and decaying vegetation.

Ducks exhibited higher nest success in nestboxes (71% success for 574 metal nest boxes vs. 37% for 116 natural cavities), although a smaller proportion were occupied (48% compared 23% occupation), probably due to lower racoon <em>Procyon lotor</em> predation (see ‘Use artificial nests that discourage predation’). Female wood ducks usually returned to the nesting areas where they last bred successfully, so the authors suggest that nest boxes should be grouped into units (2-3 per ha in high-quality habitat were recommended). Most nestboxes were metal cylinders with elliptical entrances.</p><p> </p>",

Starlings showed greater preference for vertical boxes with small entrances (3 x 4 inches) and avoided horizontal boxes with large entrances (semicircular, 11 inches in diameter). In 1965, when all vertical boxes were removed and all horizontal boxes had larger openings, there was an abrupt decrease in starling nest box use, despite no change in the starling population size. Starlings preferred boxes in open sites than those in wooded sites, whereas wood ducks showed no preference.

Sheltered birds, however, appeared to lose weight more rapidly at the end of incubation. Sheltered nests had more stable temperatures than controls (average temperature range was 6.1<sup>o</sup>C lower for sheltered nest). Paired nests were less than 10 m apart (to ensure similar microclimates) and were at similar stages of incubation when a shelter consisting of a 46 x 46 cm roof and two 25 x 46 cm walls (with 12, 2.5 cm holes in) was placed over one of the nests. The walls were positioned facing east-west.</p><p> </p>",

The number of broods increased in 2000, but not subsequently. Goldeneyes used 23-43% of nest boxes, with 37-67% hatching success for 261 nests. Three nests were erected at each lake: those above water or on trees on the shore had higher success rates than those in clearcuts 25-160 m away from shore (50% success for 56 nests above water, 56% for 63 nests on the shore and 40% for 86 nests in clear cuts). Boxes were 24 × 22 × 60 cm with a 10 x 13 cm entrance hole. American kestrels <em>Flaco sparverius</em> also used nest boxes, although their use declined over time.</p><p> </p>",
