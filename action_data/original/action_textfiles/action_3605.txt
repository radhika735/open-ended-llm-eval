No loggerhead turtles were caught in the modified net but were occasionally caught in the unmodified net (no data on turtles are provided). Catch rates of target prawns <em>Penaeus </em>spp. and <em>Metapenaeus bennettae</em> varied between no significant reduction and a 29% reduction in modified compared to unmodified nets, depending on location and season (data reported as a cross-site analysis of fishing power, see original paper for details). Trawl nets modified by adding a polypropylene mesh panel with an escape hole in front of the codend were tested in two trials (May 1991 and January 1992) on a 15 m research trawler in an oceanic site with sandy substrate and an estuarine site with a muddy bottom. Unmodified nets were towed first (number of trawls not specified) and then the modified net was used. Between 17 and 23 tows were completed in each trial, each lasting 45–100 minutes.</p>",

Using the device reduced the catch of loggerhead turtles (0 turtles) compared to nets without the device (7 turtles). In a separate experiment, six juvenile green turtles <em>Chelonia mydas</em> were placed in the path of nets with the device. Only three passed into the net entrance and all were successfully excluded from the main part of the net. Commercially-targeted prawn <em>Penaeus </em>spp. and <em>Metapenaeus </em>spp. catch rates, size and quality were similar in nets with and without the device (see original paper for details). Two commercial 6.8 m long trawl nets (40 mm mesh) were attached to a 15 m trawler. The device was fitted to one of the nets. Between 13 and 27 linear tows were conducted per site (each 60 minutes long, 85 tows used the device in total).

No statistical tests were carried out. Nets fitted with both a turtle excluder device and a bycatch reduction device caught fewer turtles (0.005 turtles/tow, 1 individual) compared to unmodified nets (0.10 turtles/tow, 11 individuals). Overall, nets fitted with both a turtle excluder device and a bycatch reduction device caught fewer sea snakes (0.36 snakes/tow, 45 individuals), than unmodified nets (0.42 snakes/tow, 15 individuals). However, some combinations of a turtle excluder device and a bycatch reduction device caught fewer sea snakes (flexible upward grid with fisheye in front of grid: 0.2 snakes/tow, 3 individuals; square upward grid with square mesh: 0.2 snakes/tow, 8 individuals) compared to unmodified nets or other combinations tested (see original paper for details). The unwanted catch included three species of turtles and three of snakes. The effect of grids and escape zones on the commercially targeted prawn catch varied by design (see original paper for details). Devices tested included a flexible, circular, upward tilted grid with top escape hole (‘AusTED’) and a secondary escape zone in front of the grid; a square, upward tilted grid with a top escape hole (‘Nordmøre’) and secondary escape zone after the grid; and a circular downward tilted grid (‘Super Shooter’) with a secondary escape zone after the grid. Secondary escape zones included different configurations of a ‘fish eye’ or ‘square mesh window’ (see original paper for full details). Vessels towed twin Florida Flyer prawn trawl nets from each side of the vessel in scientific trials of one-month duration (sea turtles: February 1995, October 1995, October 1996; sea snakes: October 1995). Nets fitted with one of the designs of grid and an unmodified net were randomly assigned to either side of the vessel.</p>",

Nets fitted with both an escape window and grid caught 100% fewer sea turtles (with devices: 0 turtles; unmodified nets: 66 turtles) and 5% fewer sea snakes (number not provided), compared to unmodified nets. The use of a “turtle excluder device” and a “bycatch reduction device” had been compulsory since 2000 in the Australian prawn fishery. Commercial vessels towed twin Florida Flyer prawn trawl nets from each side of the vessels in August–November 2001. Modified nets were fitted with one of two designs of escape window (a “Bigeye” design or a square-mesh escape window) and either an upward or downward facing exclusion grid (rigid or semi-rigid frame with ≤120 mm bar spacing and an opening of ≥700 mm). A modified and an unmodified net were randomly assigned to either side of the vessel and towed simultaneously (33 modified nets examined for sea turtles, 214 for sea snakes; 84 unmodified nets for sea turtles, 432 for sea snakes). The combinations of various device designs were not compared. Where possible, sea turtles (4 species) and sea snakes (12 species) caught were identified to species. The “Bigeye” design was later removed from the Australian list of approved escape zone designs.</p>",

No statistical tests were carried out for unwanted catch. During trials, one turtle entered a trawl net modified with a ‘Super Shooter’ and was successfully excluded. No turtles entered trawl nets modified with two other excluder devices that were tested.

All turtle excluder devices were downward-facing grids (set to an angle of 45–48 degrees) located immediately in front of the codend and accompanied by a bottom escape hole. Four different excluder devices were tested: a lightweight rigid aluminium grid (which broke down and was excluded from the study); a flexible mixed-cable grid; a semi-rigid grid of steel and rubber; a ‘Super Shooter’ aluminium grid with enlarged space between bars (see original paper for details). Data were collected during 42 tows with an average duration of 48 minutes (11–15 tows/excluder device). Excluder devices were tested on a four-sided net using standard commercial trawl fishing rigging and operation.</p>",
