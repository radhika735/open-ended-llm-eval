        "background_definitions": "<p>Incubation temperatures (for example warmer or cooler, constant or fluctuating) can influence the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings and newborns (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Practitioners carrying out conservation activities aimed at maximising hatching success, such as relocating eggs for artificial incubation or to on-beach hatcheries, will therefore need to consider the potential impact of temperature during incubation on hatchlings and populations. Human-induced climate change may also influence the sex ratios of some species of reptiles and limit the viability of populations over time.  It may be possible to counter the impacts of climate change on affected populations by managing temperatures during incubation to create appropriate sex ratios.</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies that test the impact of different temperatures on the sex ratio of reptile hatchlings or newborns. For studies that discuss the effectiveness of relocating c rocodilian nests/eggs for incubation more generally, see <a href=\"../../actions/3799\"><em>Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation</em></a>, <a href=\"../../actions/3783\"><em>Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries)</em></a>, and <a href=\"../../actions/3793\"><em>Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery</em></a>. For studies that discuss the effectiveness of captive breeding more generally, see <a href=\"../../actions/3757\"><em>Breed reptiles in captivity</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Results were not statistically tested. Hatching success ranged from 90–100% (10–20 eggs/group). Less females were produced from eggs exposed to 34°C for 4–7 days (0 of 10 to 2 of 15, 0–13% female hatchlings) compared to when eggs were incubated at 31–32°C (15 of 20, 75% female hatchlings). Eggs were incubated at 31–32°C, and nine groups of 10 eggs were exposed to 34°C for four continuous days starting on the 14th and 24th day of incubation. One group of 16 eggs was exposed to seven days at 34°C from the 24th–31st day of incubation. An additional group of 20 eggs was incubated at 31–32°C for the whole duration.

In 2013, a total of 134 viable eggs were collected from four wild nests and clutches were split evenly between three incubation temperatures (31, 33 or 34°C) with two groups/temperature. Eggs were incubated in moist vermiculite at high humidity. Forty-six eggs were dissected during development, just after the thermosensitive period when sex is determined. Sex was assessed by histological methods (46 embryos and 14 hatchlings) or by visual examination four months after hatching (74 hatchlings). </p>",
