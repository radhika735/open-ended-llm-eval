Of the six case studies concerning birds, education and awareness decreased the hunting of American black duck <em>Anas rubripes</em> (USA and Canada) and threatened geese through more stringent regulations; did not decrease lead poisoning of common loons <em>Gavia immer</em> in New England, three years after pamphlet distribution; decreased oil contamination in Colorado and Wyoming pits (USA) by 67%; increased hatching rates of snowy plovers <em>Charadrius nivosus</em> in California (USA) by 18% in 5 years; and doubled seabird populations in a region in Quebec (Canada). Overall, education and awareness was almost never a sufficient factor in changing behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. <em></em></p>",
