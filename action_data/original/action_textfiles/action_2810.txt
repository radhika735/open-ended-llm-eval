This can partly be achieved by making fishing gear as selective as possible. Fishers have knowledge and information about the marine environment that may be invaluable in informing the design and potential uptake of new fishing gear. Fishers are unlikely to use new gear that is impractical to handle and deploy or that causes large losses of their commercial target catch. Involving fishers in the process may not only help encourage development of more selective fishing gears, but it may ensure more successful uptake if the potential solutions have fisher buy-in and approval (Eliasen <em>et al.</em> 2019; Feekings <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>\r\n<p>Eliasen S.Q., Feekings J., Krag L., Veiga–Malta T., Mortensen L.O. &amp; Ulrich C.
