Cutting reeds like this changes the composition of the reedbeds, resulting in higher spring water levels and higher reed biomass (due to increased regrowth) than in uncut reedbeds (Poulin &amp; Lefebvre 2002). A comparison of cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France found that there was also a higher abundance of food arthropods in cut reeds, although lower abundances of birds in summer (Poulin &amp; Lefebvre 2002).</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

No nests were found in beds cut that year and very few (and only in one site) in beds cut less than three years (fewer than 0.7 nests/ha) or more than eleven years before. The authors speculate that geese need an intermediate density of reed stems to nest effectively.</p><p> </p>",

Reeds at sites with low water levels were cut in spring (March-April), compared with winter (completed by December) for high water level sites, but the effect of cutting was not specifically investigated.
