When such waterways have steep sides, reptiles may fall in and be unable to escape, or aquatic reptiles may enter deliberately but struggle to exit the water. Escape routes may be installed to enable reptiles that have fallen in or otherwise entered the water to escape back onto land. These may take the form or ramps, ladders, shallow inlets or other structures that reptiles could use to climb out.</p>",
