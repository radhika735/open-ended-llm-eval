The only fertile spawning occurred in spring 1996, which contained 25 eggs, but they were destroyed by fungus. From 1994-1995 , two male and three sub-adult frogs were housed in two outdoor tanks (120 x 60 x 60 cm) with a sub-surface water depth 50-100 mm. Males called when they were in outdoor enclosures, but fertile eggs were not produced until animals were moved to indoor tanks. From 1996, 6–7 frogs were housed in each of the five indoor enclosures.</p>",

At Melbourne Zoo from 2006–2009 no recorded mating calls were played, (average clutch size: 17; egg mortality: 91%). A recorded tape of mating calls was installed and played in 2010 (average clutch size: 20; egg mortality: 78%), 2011 (average clutch size: 40; egg mortality: 70%) and in 2012 (average clutch size: 46; egg mortality: 27%). At Taronga Zoo a recorded tape of mating calls was installed and played in 2010 (average clutch size: 80; egg mortality: 72%). In 2011, recorded mating calls were not used (average clutch size: 70; egg mortality: 25.5%). In 2012, recorded mating calls were played (average clutch size: 54; egg mortality: 28%). The tape was played for 15 minutes of each hour from 1800 to 2200 hours and was audible to the frogs in all tanks.</p>",
