Sand lizards gradually colonized the newly created clearings and eventually abandoned unmanaged habitat after 16 years (see original paper). During the first 10 years after clearing and sand patch creation, female sand lizard abundance declined (9–11%) but increased annually (11–19%) after a second, larger-scale clearing and sand patch creation programme was carried out. In particular, subadult lizard abundance increased more after the second creation programme (after first programme &lt;10% increase; after second programme &gt;150% increase in relative population size). Restoration was first carried out in 1988 and 1992 when nine 1–2 ha lizard-appropriate habitat patches in two sites were managed by tree felling and creating sand patches. A second restoration programme took place in the same two sites in 1999 and 2001, creating 18 habitat patches (10 ha each) by tree felling, soil scarification and excavating 7–11 sand patches/site (100–200 m<sup>2</sup> patches). Sand lizards were monitored from May–September in 1988–2004 by hand capture in unmanaged and managed areas of the sites.</p>",

Species richness was higher on outcrops where trees were removed (5 species/outcrop) compared to overgrown outcrops (2 species/outcrop), and similar to outcrops that were naturally sun-exposed (5 species/outcrop). In outcrops with trees removed, the relative abundance of four of five sun-tolerant species increased, and two of two shade-tolerant species decreased (see original paper for details). In 2007, trees were selectively removed manually from 25 overgrown rock outcrops. Additionally, 30 overgrown (shady) outcrops and 20 naturally sun-exposed plots were selected that had no trees removed. Outcrops (of around 100 m<sup>2</sup>) were separated by an average of 80 m. Reptiles were sampled monthly from May 2007–October 2009, and captured reptiles were marked.</p>",

A total of 41 common lizards and 102 slow worms were found in clearings maintained by cutting, whereas no slow worms or common lizards were found in either recently coppiced sites (2–6 years previously) or older coppiced sites (9–17 years old). In each of two areas of woodland, three clearings maintained by vegetation cutting (one of the open areas was selected two weeks after surveys began), three sites of recently coppiced woodland (2–6 years old) and three sites of older coppice (9–17 years old) were selected.

Opening up the forest canopy caused an increase in the likelihood of viper occupancy (78%) compared to beforehand (34%). Overall, open forest was more likely to be occupied by snakes regardless of management (recently cut open canopy: 78%, open canopy maintained: 78%, open canopy cut 5–7 years ago: 69%) than closed canopy, unmanaged forest (9%). In winter 2006–2008, canopy cover was opened on four transects running alongside pre-existing public paths (5–10 m wide x 3,700 m long/transect by end 2008).

The effect of removing canopy or shrubs cannot be separated. Estimated rattlesnake densities were greater in 0-year-old (0.072–0.141 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>), 1-year-old (0.045 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) and 3-year-old (0.133 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) cut plots than uncut plots (0.003–0.009 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>). Rattlesnake densities in 4-year-old cut plots (0.013 snakes/100 m<sup>2</sup>) were similar to uncut plots.

In addition, 4 ha of adjacent forest was mechanically cleared in 2011. Snakes were monitored using visual encounter surveys in 66 plots with canopy removal (50 plots of cut vegetation in breeding areas and sixteen 36 m<sup>2</sup> plots within the forest areas cleared ion 2011), and 44 areas with no vegetation removal (twenty-eight 28 m<sup>2 </sup>plots of uncut vegetation in breeding areas and sixteen 36 m<sup>2</sup> plots in uncut forest). In 2011 and 2012, the number of snakes caught in canopy removal areas (removal having occurred 0–4 years previously) was compared to the number of snakes in uncut plots. It is unclear whether the results reported are based on the breeding areas only or include the cut and uncut forest plots. Surveys were carried out once a week in June–August 2011 and May–August 2012. Snakes were captured, sexed and individually marked with PIT tags.</p>",
