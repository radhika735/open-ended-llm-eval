However, many grasslands have been abandoned leading to accumulation of litter which may reduce the growth and germination of some grassland plants. Removing this litter may, consequently, aid growth and germination of grassland plants.</p>\r\n<p>The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of removing leaf litter before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot with leaf litter left in place). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3397\"><em>Sow grass seeds</em></a>’, ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3398\"><em>Sow grassland forb species</em></a>’ or ‘<a href=\"../../actions/3432\"><em>Sow native grass and forbs</em></a>’.</p>",

During the first year after sowing, the average number of ragged robin seedlings was higher in plots with litter removed (2–3 seedlings/plot) than in plots without litter removed (0 seedlings/plot) at two of seven sites. The same was true for marsh birdsfoot trefoil seedlings at four of seven sites (litter removed: 1–11 seedlings/plot; litter not removed: 0.1–3 seedlings/plot). After one year, the average biomass of ragged robin and marsh birdsfoot trefoil transplants was higher in plots with litter removed than without at one of seven sites and none of the sites, respectively (data not reported). There were no significant differences at any of the other sites. Two plots (1 x 2 m) within each of six blocks were established at each of seven fen-grassland sites. Two hundred ragged robin and marsh birdsfoot trefoil seeds were sown within an area (0.25 x 0.25 m) in each plot in autumn 2002. Leaf litter was removed from one plot/block prior to sowing. Four equal-sized juvenile plants of each species were transplanted to each plot in April 2003. Vegetation was monitored in each plot at the end of summer in 2003 and 2004. Biomass was sampled in August 2004.</p><p> </p>",

For one sown species, pasqueflower <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris</em>, the average number of seedlings was higher in plots where litter and vegetation were removed before sowing (3 seedlings/plot) than in plots where litter and vegetation were not removed before sowing (0.6 seedlings/plot). The two other sown species, mountain clover <em>Trifolium montanum</em> and prostrate speedwell <em>Veronica prostrata</em>, did not germinate in sown plots with or without litter and vegetation removal. In May–August 2007, at each of five sites, leaf litter and vegetation were removed in four 1 x 1 m plots after which 25 seeds of <em>Pulsatilla vulgaris, Trifolium montanum </em>or <em>Veronica prostrata</em> were sown. In another four plots, seeds were sown but litter and vegetation were not removed. All sites were former forest stands that were clearcut and restored to grassland 3–14 years before the study. In May 2008, the number of seedlings in each plot was counted.</p>",

In autumn 2008, two 1 x 1 m plots were established in each of twenty 3 x 3 m blocks. In one plot/block, litter was removed with a rake and seeds of two grass species <em>Festuca vaginata</em> and <em>Stipa borysthenica</em> were sown, while in the other plot, litter was not removed before seeds were sown.
