In the migration area south of Cadiz, there was no difference in the number of flocks of birds coming within 100 m of the power lines, although there was a higher proportion of raptors in the section with the eagle model (42% of 119 records were raptors vs. 21% of 43 records) and flocks flew above 20 m more frequently in the section with the eagle model. In the non-migration area (the Coto Doñana National Park), more flocks and a higher proportion of raptors, waterfowl and corvids were seen in sections near the eagle model, compared with control sections (the <em>Accipiter</em> models were not tested in the park).</p><p> </p>",
