        "background_definitions": "<p>Oil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column and can contaminate beaches and other coastal habitats.  There are a number of different methods that can be used in an attempt to contain or recover the spill including: open-water mechanical recovery using booms and skimmers, offshore dispersant application using chemical dispersants, off-shore in situ burning, manual and mechanical clean-up to collect and dispose of contaminated sand or soil, and bioremediation using nutrients, aeration or bacteria to speed up natural breakdown of the oil (Huff &amp; Shigenaka 2003). Different methods vary in number of ways, including cost, efficiency, time taken, amount of oil recovered, as well as impact on wildlife (Dave &amp; Ghaly 2011).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dave D. &amp; Ghaly A.E.
