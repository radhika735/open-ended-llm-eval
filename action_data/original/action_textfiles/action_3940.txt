        "background_definitions": "<p>Thinning is a forestry practice that involves the selective removal of trees to reduce tree density and improve the growth rate and health of the remaining trees. Thinning has been done historically to maximize timber production but may have ecological benefits. Thinning removes some of the canopy, allowing light in to the woodland floor, replicating the natural creation of woodland clearings. This may benefit butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence. However, some species spend almost their entire lives in the canopy, and may be adversely affected by the loss of even a few canopy trees, so caution should be taken when applying this action.</p>\r\n<p>For studies that used thinning as part of selective logging methods, see the intervention “<em>Biological resource use – <a href=\"../../actions/3868\">Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting</a></em>”.</p>",

Forest managed by thinning had a similar abundance (54 individuals/trap), species richness (76 species) and diversity (data presented as model results) of butterflies to naturally regenerating forest (abundance: 56 individuals/trap; richness: 71 species). However, species with smaller geographic ranges were caught less frequently in thinned forest (data presented as model results). See paper for individual species results. From 1960–1990, a 216 km<sup>2</sup> forest was selectively logged. From 1992 the forest was protected, and two management options were implemented: liberation thinning and natural regeneration (no management). Liberation thinning was designed to promote the growth of commercial timber species, and included cutting of lianas and climbers, and killing some non-commercial trees. Rare trees and important fruit trees were protected. From January–March 1996, butterflies were sampled in 30 ha of thinned forest and 30 ha of naturally regenerating forest, using 28 banana-baited traps in each habitat. Traps were set 1 m above ground, 100 m apart, for six consecutive days, and checked daily.</p>",

Four years after thinning, the abundance (12–20 individuals/transect) and species richness (9–12 species) of butterflies were higher in thinned woodland than in woodland which had not been thinned (abundance: 4 individuals/transect; richness: 5–7 species). The increase in butterflies correlated with an increase in understorey plants in the thinned woodland. In January–March 1997, tree cover in a 40-ha watershed was reduced from 35 to 10%, by removing individual trees &lt;20 cm diameter. Felled trees were applied as rough mulch onto adjacent bare soil. In an adjacent 40-ha watershed, the tree cover was left at 40%. In June–July 1999 and 2001, butterflies were surveyed twice/year on 20 permanent 100-m transects/watershed.

These results were primarily due to the abundance of species of blue (Lycaenidae) and white (Pieridae) butterflies (see paper for details). In 1997, four blocks within a 5,000-ha ponderosa pine <em>Pinus ponderosa </em>forest were each divided into two units (≤40-ha each).
