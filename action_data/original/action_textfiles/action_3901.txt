For example, even when offered a food source, moths spend less time feeding in the presence of artificial light than when kept in complete darkness (van Langevelde <em>et al.</em> 2017). Attraction to artificial lights may also limit moths’ dispersal ability and mate-finding behaviour. One option to reduce this impact is to protect areas with natural light regimes, by reducing the time that lights are on, or removing unnecessary lights entirely (Gaston <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Gaston K.J., Davies T.W., Bennie J., Hopkins J.
