On green roofs, both the abundance (514 individuals) and species richness (12 species) of butterflies was lower than in urban parks (abundance: 3,141–8,882 butterflies; richness: 50–109 species). However, the abundance of butterflies was higher on green roofs established longer ago, and on roofs with more nectar plant species covering a larger area (data presented as model results). Eleven green roofs (95–590 m<sup>2</sup>, 7–34 m above ground), established 13–46 months before the study, contained a total of 34 butterfly nectar plant species (1–16 species/roof, covering 2–41 m<sup>2</sup>). Two urban parks (13–26 ha), established 18–25 years before the study, contained 20–45 nectar plant species. From August 2011–May 2012, butterflies were surveyed for four hours twice/month on each roof. From July 2008–June 2009, butterflies were surveyed in one urban park, and from March 2011–February 2012 they were surveyed in a second park (no further details provided).</p>",
