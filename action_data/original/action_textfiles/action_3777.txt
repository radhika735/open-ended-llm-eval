Following release, 8 of 12 head-started snakes survived until hibernation (67% survival over 5 months), but none survived one year, whereas seven of 12 resident snakes survived until hibernation (58% survival) and four survived to the end of the year (33% survival). Head-started snakes had smaller home ranges (head-started: 2 ha; resident: 5 ha) and grew less than resident snakes (head-started: 0.03 cm/day &amp; 0.05 g/day; resident: 0.07 cm/day &amp; 0.80 g/day). Head-started snakes also showed less surface activity than residents (reported as activity index). In July 2007, seven pregnant snakes were captured and gave birth in captivity before being returned to their capture site. Sixty newborn snakes (30 females, 30 males) were housed in small plastic boxes (20 x 65 x 13 cm) for 11 months and 12 snakes (9 females, 3 males) were chosen for release. Twelve resident snakes (matched in terms of size and sex) were captured in May 2008. All snakes were implanted with radio transmitters and were located once/week from May–September, every two weeks from October–November and March–April, and monthly from December–February.</p>",

Six years after the first head-started iguanas were released, but while releases were ongoing, 46 and 42 iguanas were re-sighted in 2010 and 2013 respectively, and densities were estimated at 5–6 iguanas/ha. Authors reported that released iguanas were also sighted outside of the study area. In 2004–2009, a total of 307 head-started iguanas were released, and in 2010–2012, a further 98 iguanas were released. All iguanas were tagged at time of release with unique coloured glass bead combinations (as piercing on the neck crest) and PIT tags. In the first three weeks of March 2010 and 2013, iguana surveys were conducted twice a day by teams of two observers on 12 transects of unequal length (range 323–432 m). All offspring that were captured were also tagged.</p>",

Annual survival following release was similar for head-started snakes (basic conditions: 64%, semi-natural conditions: 50%) and resident snakes (46%). A range of behaviour and activity measures, including post-release movement, habitat use, and hibernation date were also similar between head-started and resident snakes (see paper for details). Head-started snakes grew more slowly than resident snakes (head-started: 0–0.05 cm/day; resident: 0–0.11 cm/day), but body condition remained similar between all groups (data presented as statistical model result). In July 2007, seven pregnant female snakes were captured and brought into captivity. Sixty offspring were raised for 18 months in individual plastic tubs (20 x 64 x 13 cm) containing a water bowl and hide. In February 2009, snakes were divided in to two groups and raised for a further four months in either basic conditions (remaining in the plastic tub) or semi-natural conditions (see paper for details). After 22 months in captivity, head-started snakes (basic conditions: 12 snakes; semi-natural conditions: 10 snakes) and an additional 15 resident wild snakes were released, and radio-tracked 1–4 times/month throughout the year. Of the resident snakes, eight were tracked in 2008–2009, three in 2009–2010, and four during both seasons.</p>",

Results were not statistically tested. After 23 years of head-starting and releasing Jamaican iguanas, 321 iguana hatchlings and 63 nesting female iguanas were counted compared to 31 hatchlings and 9 nesting females at the start of the programme. The first new wild-born female iguana joined the breeding population after 16 years. The authors reported that health of head-started individuals was generally good but that 16% died or were lost prior to being released. In 1991–2015, Jamaican iguana eggs and hatchlings were collected from the wild and head-started in a zoo. Head-started individuals were released in 1996 (278 total iguanas released, usually 6–8 years old or 1–2 kg). In 1997–2014, non-native mammalian predators (mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus</em>, cats <em>Felis catus</em>, dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> and feral pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em>) were removed using baited cage traps, snares and leg-hold traps (around 1,500 predators in 350,000 trap days over 17 years using 20–300 cage traps). In 2011–2012, an artificial nesting site was constructed 40 m south of the main nesting area. During the nesting season in 1991–2015, nests were checked daily and adult female iguanas were monitored by live trapping, observation and camera traps.</p>",
