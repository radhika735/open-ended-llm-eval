Between 1990 and 1993, a pair of salamanders housed in a planted aquarium produced 19 eggs (in February 1991) but none were produced by salamander pairs housed in an aquarium containing a gravel substrate or one with partially buried rocks and rock shards over the same period. The eggs were fixed singly to live plants. Four of the eggs hatched and three larvae were reared to maturity. The planted aquarium contained java moss <em>Vesicularia dubyana</em> and swamp-weed <em>Hygrophila</em> sp.. Eggs were removed to a separate aquarium to avoid predation by the adult salamanders or snails.</p>",
