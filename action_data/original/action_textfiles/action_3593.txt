Drill cuttings consist of fragments of rock contaminated with drilling fluids, oil, and chemicals, which may have adverse impacts on aquatic and semi-aquatic reptiles. Ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers may reduce pollution and potential harm to reptiles.</p>",
