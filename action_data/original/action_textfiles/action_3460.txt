        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Long flexible habitats’ are flexible protruding materials such as rope, ribbon or twine &gt;50 mm in length (modified from “Soft structures” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Long flexible habitats, such as macroalgal canopies and soft-bodied invertebrates, provide other organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2007). They also provide shelter from predation (Dumas &amp; Witman 1993). The size, density and material properties of flexible habitats are likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them and the spaces they create. </p>\r\n<p>Some organisms that form flexible habitats tend to be absent or sparse on intertidal artificial structures (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2016), although some readily colonize in wave-sheltered conditions (Jonsson <em>et al.</em> 2006). Artificial flexible habitats such as ropes or nets can be present on some structures, but are likely to be temporary and regularly disturbed (e.g. removed and replaced) when present. Long flexible habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively. In addition to potential biodiversity benefits, flexible habitats may offer some bioprotection for the underlying substrate, with potential to reduce weathering and enhance the durability of engineering materials (Coombes <em>et al.</em> 2013). Material choice is important for creating flexible habitats, since some flexible materials are unlikely to persist in the marine environment, while those that do may become entanglement hazards or contribute to pollution if dislodged. Studies that investigate the effects of transplanting live soft-bodied organisms onto structures are not included here, but are considered under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3472\"><em>Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3459\"><em>Create short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3472\"><em> Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Coombes M.A., Naylor L.A., Viles H.A. &amp; Thompson R.C.

After eight months, hula ropes supported mussels (<em>Mytilus edulis</em>: 5% cover), barnacles (<em>Amphibalanus improvisus</em>: 1%), red macroalgae (<em>Ceramium rubrum</em>: 0.2%) and amphipods (Amphipoda: 11–100 individuals/rope), which were all absent from piling surfaces without flexible habitats. Average biomass on ropes was 1 g/cm. Piling surfaces under hulas supported mostly barnacles (50% cover), while pilings without flexible habitats supported mostly green macroalgae (50% cover). Long flexible habitats were created by attaching polyamide rope skirts (‘hulas’) around pilings in March 2009. One hula with 167 ropes (diameter: 6 mm; length: 550 mm; density: 167/m) was attached at lowshore around each of five wooden pilings, cleared of organisms. Hulas were compared with intertidal surfaces (200 × 200 mm) on five pilings without flexible habitats, cleared of organisms. Macroalgae and invertebrates on hula ropes and piling surfaces were counted and biomass (wet weight) measured in the laboratory over eight months.</p>",
