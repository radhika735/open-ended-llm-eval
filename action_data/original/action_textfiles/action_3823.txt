        "background_definitions": "<p>High grading is the practice by fishers of discarding marketable fish that have the lowest commercial value so they can land more fish of higher value (e.g. to maximise profit). It occurs in fisheries managed by catch limits (e.g. quotas/catch shares) or by measures requiring the landing of their total catch. Because survival of the discarded fish can be low, a ban on high grading may reduce overall fishing effort and mortality. In 2009, high grading was made an illegal practice in European Union waters. However, there is evidence that suggests its effectiveness may depend on the ability to detect and enforce it (Batsleer <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>\r\n<p>Batsleer J., Hamon K.G., van Overzee H.M.J., Rijnsdorp A.D. &amp; Poos J.J.

Data were not tested statistically. Across all catches, the proportion of megrim above minimum landing size discarded and classed as “bruised” remained widespread both after (2010–2012) and before (2008–2009) high grading was prohibited (after: 0.10–0.15, before: 0.13–0.15). Similarly, legal-sized but “small” megrim continued to be discarded, but in increasingly lower proportions (after: 0.1–0.36, before: 0.32–0.39). High grading was prohibited in the North Sea in 2009 and meant that any species managed under quotas (such as megrim) was required to be landed if above minimum landing size. Data were collected by on board sampling of catches on eight demersal (bottom) fishing vessels based in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, and working in the mixed demersal fishery in the northern North Sea/North Atlantic Ocean (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Division IVa). Observer trips (2–8 d) were undertaken between May 2008 and March 2012. A total of 25 trips (22 twin trawl and 3 seine) and 407 hauls were sampled. Megrim length was recorded from the retained and discarded portions of the catch. Discards were categorized as “small” or “bruised”.</p>",
