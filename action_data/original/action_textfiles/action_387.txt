This led to August partridge numbers being 75% higher and breeding numbers the next year being 36% higher. Over three years this led to breeding densities that were 2.6 times greater when predators were removed. Predators removed through trapping and shooting were predominantly red foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>, carrion crows <em>Corvus corone</em> and black-billed magpies <em>Pica pica</em>.</p><p> </p>",

However, in the previous two years of predator removal (1992-3) and years without removal (1989-91, 1997-9), productivity was lower on the experimental site. In non-removal years, productivity averaged 0.1 chicks/female, compared with 1.4 chicks/female in removal years.
