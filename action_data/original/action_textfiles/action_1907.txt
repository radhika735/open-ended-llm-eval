This can cause negative effects on their gastrointestinal health. Supplementing diets is common practice to promote the overall health of captive animals, however there can still be differences in the fermentation process of these diets.  See 2.2 ‘Feed whole carcasses with or without organs/gastrointestinal tract)’.</p>",
