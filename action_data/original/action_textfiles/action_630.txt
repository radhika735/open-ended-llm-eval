The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The status of the other two birds was unknown. Eight of the released birds (including both with unknown statuses) were hand-reared from wild eggs (see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’ for details), the remaining four were captive-bred birds. Birds were transferred to small cages at the release site when 46-63 days old and then into a larger aviary when 62-96 days old. Birds were then slowly released, with the timing dependent on their ability to fly and find food. Supplementary food was provided for several months after release and non-native predators (mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>) were trapped from around the aviary whilst releases were on-going (see ‘Invasive and other problematic species’ for more studies of invasive species control).</p><p> </p>",

The same study found that 14 (six male, eight female) captive-bred puaiohi <em>Myadestes palmeri </em>(a critically endangered thrush) released at a marshland site on Kaua’i, Hawaii, USA, in 1999 successfully fledged at least seven chicks (from six pairs).

Clutch size (average of 2 eggs/nest, 16 nests), daily survival rates (97%) and fledglings/successful nest (1.4 fledglings/nest, ten nests) were similar for released and wild birds, although fewer fledglings/active nest were produced (0.58 fledglings/nest vs. 1.1 fledglings/nest).

Survival to one year was between 33% (2003-4) and 75% (2005-6), with increases possibly due to the presence of established birds in later years. The first successful breeding was during 2004-5, when five chicks from two females fledged. This increased to 40 from 19 in 2005-6 and 47 from 38 in 2006-7. First-year survival for wild-bred birds was 60-88%. Birds were kept in large aviaries at the release site for at least seven days before release (birds that had not been put in large aviaries before were first placed in small cages within aviaries) and fed a diet of fruit, commercial insectivore food and eggs. Adults were released in groups of one or two (after 30 days in the aviaries), whereas juveniles were released in groups of two to nine birds. Food was provided continuously at the release site.</p><p> </p>",
