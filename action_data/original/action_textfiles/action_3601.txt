No statistical tests were carried out. Nets fitted with escape zones caught turtles at a similar rate (0.14 turtles/tow, 17 individuals) as unmodified nets (0.13 turtles/tow, 9 individuals). The unwanted catch included three species of turtles and three of snakes. The effect of escape zones on the commercially targeted prawn catch varied by design (see original paper for details). Escape zone designs tested included ‘fisheye’, ‘radial escape section’, ‘square mesh window’ and square mesh windows fitted with a number of modifications (see original paper for details). Vessels towed twin Florida Flyer prawn trawl nets from each side of the vessel in trials of one-month duration (sea turtles: February and October 1995). Nets fitted with one of the designs of escape zone and an unmodified net were randomly assigned to either side of the vessel.</p>",
