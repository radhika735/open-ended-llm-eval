        "background_definitions": "<p>Ex-industrial, or brownfield, sites can provide important early-successional habitat for a range of species, including butterflies and moths. However, such sites are often targeted for urban development (Robins <em>et al.</em> 2013) or fertilized and planted to accelerate succession (Tropek <em>et al.</em> 2010). Legal protection which prevents development may be required to retain such sites, and restoration which maintains a state of early succession may be important for rare and sensitive species (Tropek <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Robins J., Henshall S. &amp; Farr A.
