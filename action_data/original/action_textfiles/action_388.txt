At one site, the rail population increased from 40 in 1989 to 104 in 1994. Over the study period, the number of foxes trapped remained relatively constant (66-94/year) despite increased trapping effort, suggesting population decline.  However, the authors suggest that fox immigration into the area meant that predator control would only be effective in the short term.</p><p> </p>",
