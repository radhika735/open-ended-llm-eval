It may be possible to maintain temporary ponds by deepening them or by artificially increasing water levels. Grazing may also help to maintain ponds as a study found that temporary pools that had not been grazed for three years dried 50 days earlier than grazed pools (Pyke &amp; Marty 2005). Studies investigating the effects of grazing on amphibians are discussed in ‘Threat: Agriculture – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/780\">Manage grazing regime</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Pyke C.R. &amp; Marty J.
