        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Treatment of chytridiomycosis is vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. Also to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between captive or wild populations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">The chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> is very sensitive to temperatures above 32°C. At 37°C the fungus is killed within four hours and at 47°C within 30 minutes (Young <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study found that the probability of infection by chytrid in the wild decreased strongly with increasing time spent with body temperatures above 25°C in three frog species (Rowley &amp; Alford 2013). A study in captivity also found that fewer frogs became infected and died when exposed to the chytrid fungus if they were housed at 27°C rather than 17°C or 23°C (50 vs 100% mortality; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2004). Increasing temperatures within amphibian housing may therefore provide a treatment for chytridiomycosis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Berger L., Speare R., Hines H.B., Marantelli G., Hyatt A.D., McDonald K.R., Skerratt L.F., Olsen V., Clarke J.M., Gillespie G., Mahony M., Sheppard N., Williams C. &amp; Tyler M.J.

All infected frogs in the treatment with two eight-hour periods at 37°C tested negative for chytrid after 94 days and survived for at least another five months. Infected frogs at a constant 20°C survived for the shortest period (55 days), while survival was intermediate in the treatments with naturally fluctuating temperatures (14–23°C; 83 days) and two eight-hour periods at 8°C (one frog survived over 94 days). All frogs in these treatments were heavily infected. All but one uninfected frog survived. Eighty juvenile frogs were divided equally into the four temperature regimes. Half in each treatment were infected with chytrid fungus and half with sterile medium as a control. Survival was examined over 94 days and infection level determined at post-mortem.</p><p> </p>",

Three infected frogs died during treatment, but the remaining four tested negative for chytrid following treatment. All infected frogs kept at room temperature remained infected and four died. No uninfected frogs died with or without treatment. Weight gain in cured frogs was significantly greater than infected frogs (1.1–1.4 vs 0.7–0.9 g). Frogs were raised from eggs collected from the wild and were experimentally infected with chytrid. Seven infected and five uninfected frogs were placed in an incubator for five days at 32°C. Nine infected and 15 uninfected frogs were kept at room temperature (20°C). Frogs were weighed at days 172 and 257 and sampled for chytrid on day 172.</p><p> </p>",
