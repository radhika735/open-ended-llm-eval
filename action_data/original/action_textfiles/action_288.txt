However, this decline was only fewer northern fulmars <em>Fulmarus glacialis </em>being caught, with the bycatch rate of shearwater <em>Puffinus </em>spp. remaining constant. Overall, the number of birds following and the rate of attacks on baits were consistent across treatments, although attack rates by shearwaters were twice as high when using a setting funnel. The study took place in the Pacific cod <em>Gadus macrocephalus</em> and walleye pollock <em>Theragra chalcogramma</em> fishery southeast of the Pribilof Islands, USA.
