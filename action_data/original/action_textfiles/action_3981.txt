There were fewer butterflies along margins which were left to regenerate without sowing (average: 14 individuals), margins sown with tussocky grass seed (average: 21) and margins sown with cereal crop (average: 9) than those sown with a grass and wildflower seed mix (average: 44) or a combination of tussocky grass seed and grass and wildflower seed mix (average: 33). There was no difference in species richness between any of the treatments see paper for details). Four 6 m wide margins of winter cereal fields (all adjacent to hedges) on two farms were split into 72 m long plots and sown in September 1999 with either a tussocky grass mix, a grass and wildflower mix, half the width tussocky grass and half grass and wildflower mix, cereal crop or left to regenerate naturally with no sowing. Butterflies were surveyed weekly from May–September 2000 using walking transects (21 surveys/field in total).</p>",

More butterflies were recorded in sown or naturally regenerated grass margins (46 individuals/km) than in cropped field edges (21 individuals/km), but the species richness was similar (grass margin: 8; cropped edges: 9 species). Of the ‘key’ grassland butterfly species, only meadow brown <em>Maniola jurtina</em> was more abundant in grass margins (19 individuals/km) than in cropped field edges (9 individuals/km). However, fewer butterflies (32–38 individuals/km), including meadow brown (4–5 individuals/km), were found in naturally regenerated margins than in sown margins (all butterflies: 41–125 individuals/km; meadow brown: 27–57 individuals/km). In 1996, eight 6-m-wide margins were established on two farms. Five were sown with grass seed mixtures (6 or 9 species) and three were left to natural regeneration. One arable field edge without margins on each farm was used as a control. Butterfly abundance was monitored weekly from late June to early August 1997–2000. All butterflies were recorded, but special note was taken of ‘key’ grassland species: meadow brown, gatekeeper<em> Pyronia tithonus</em>, small skipper <em>Thymelicus sylvestris</em>, Essex skipper <em>Thymelicus lineola</em>, and large skipper<em> Ochlodes venata</em>.</p>",

There was a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies and burnet moths in uncultivated margins which were next to semi-natural grasslands (abundance: 0.1–1.6 individuals/100 m<sup>2</sup>; richness: 0.1–1.7 species/100 m) than in margins which were &gt;1 km from the nearest grassland (abundance: 0.0–0.9 individuals/100 m<sup>2</sup>; richness: 0.1–0.9 species/100 m). Butterfly abundance in margins close to grassland was similar to the grassland (0.5–1.2 individuals/100 m<sup>2</sup>), but species richness in the margins was lower than the grassland (0.9–2.0 species/100 m). In each of 12 areas, two uncultivated strips of perennial grassland bordering cultivated fields were surveyed. One strip was situated within 100 m of an area of grazed, semi-natural grassland (5–12 ha), and the other was &gt;1 km from the nearest grassland &gt;0.5 ha. From late May–early August 2004, grassland-dependent butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed six times on one 300-m transect/margin, and on a transect through each semi-natural grassland (150 m/ha).</p>",

Results were not tested for statistical significance. In permanent, uncultivated margins the abundance (120 individuals/1,000 m) and species richness (9.4 species/plot) of butterflies and day-flying moths were higher than in temporary, in-field, sown fallow plots that were one-year-old (abundance: 2–3 individuals/1,000 m; richness: 0.5–0.7 species/plot) or two-years-old (abundance: 5–30 individuals/1,000 m; richness: 0.7–4.2 species/plot), or left as stubble (abundance: 17 individuals/1,000 m; richness: 4.2 species/plot). No butterflies or moths were recorded in spring cereal fields. Six species showed a significant preference for permanent margins over temporary fallow plots (Essex skipper <em>Thymelicus lineola</em>, ringlet <em>Aphantopus hyperantus</em>, Lewes wave <em>Scopula immorata</em>, shaded broad-bar <em>Scotopteryx chenopodiata</em>, silver-ground carpet <em>Xanthorhoe montanata</em>, black-veined moth <em>Siona lineata</em>). In 2003, ten permanently uncultivated, 250-m long, 2.5-m wide field margins next to a 16.5-ha field were selected. The field was divided into four blocks, each containing eight 0.3-ha plots. Six plots/block were sown with grasses in either 2003 or 2004 and left fallow (see paper for details), one plot/block was sown with spring barley in 2003 and left as stubble in 2004, and one plot/block was sown with spring barley in both years. In June–July 2004, butterflies and day-flying moths were recorded four times, two weeks apart, on one 250-m transect through each margin or plot.</p>",

All data were presented as model results. There were more butterfly species on longer or wider margins than on shorter or narrower margins. Margins which were completely mown in June or July had fewer butterfly species than margins which were only partially mown in June or July, or were mown at another time of year or not mown at all. On each of seven farms (58–700 ha), 10 permanent, unsprayed and uncropped arable field margins (≥50 m long and ≥1 m wide) were sampled.  Margins were managed by either complete mowing in June or July, partial mowing in June or July, or mowing at other times of year (including unmown margins).
