Newts colonized new ponds within four years. By 2004, they bred in nine of 14 ponds, inhabited all terrestrial habitats (at low densities) and had moved up to 4 km away. Fourteen ponds and many small pools were created and planted with aquatic species, as well fish removal from existing ponds and terrestrial habitat management. Initially, 24 of each species were housed in indoor tanks. In following years, eggs were produced in an outdoor enclosure and then collected and transferred indoors for rearing. Sixty captive-bred great crested newt and 90 smooth newt larvae and juveniles were released into two created ponds annually. In 2000–2004, 5–10 adults were also released into the two ponds.</p><p> </p>",
