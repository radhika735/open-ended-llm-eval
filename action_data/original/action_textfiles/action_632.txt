It may therefore increase the chances of birds surviving if they are kept at the release site for some time before being released, either enclosed in pens or with access to the habitat outside.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">This section includes only those studies that make a comparison between releases using holding pens and those without. Many of the studies in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ describe releases that use holding pens, but do not test the effects of using them.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

This difference held both for all birds (26% of 69 soft release birds alive after two months vs. 48% of 23 ‘standard release’ birds) and for wild-caught birds (37% of 49 soft release birds vs. 63% of 16 standard releases). Soft release involved preconditioning to the local environment and supplying birds with local food while in captivity.

All four birds released without an enclosure were killed by foxes within three days, whilst one of 25 birds released into the enclosure survived for at least seven months and ten other established themselves in territories in the release site. Twelve of the dead birds were predated and two contracted pox. Other release techniques and descriptions of the captive-breeding programme are discussed in ‘Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations’, ‘Use artificial insemination in captive breeding’, ‘Release captive-bred individuals’, ‘Release birds in ‘coveys’ and ‘Use holding pens at site of release and clip birds’ wings’.</p><p> </p>",
