The presence of amoebae increases the risk of amoebic gill disease. The lower levels of amoebae persisted for 3 days before gradually increasing to pre-bathing levels on day 10. Salmon were given freshwater baths for two hours then monitored for 10 days. Samples were removed from fish before bathing and at 1, 3, 5 and 10 day intervals after bathing to determine the number of amoebae present on the gills.</p><p> </p>",

By the end of the study, amoebic gill disease occurred within 35% of fish within both groups. Monthly samples were removed from salmon in three groups receiving freshwater baths and three un-bathed groups. Average biomass per pen was 11, 663 kg for bathed groups and 20, 929 kg for un- bathed groups. Signs of clinical disease were assessed monthly using the routine Tasmanian salmon farmers gill assessment method</p>",
