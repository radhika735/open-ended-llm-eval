However, the increase in survival rate following kestrel-specific legislation in 1926 was insignificant (45% for 1917-1925 vs 55% for 1926-1939) and there was a significant fall in 1973-1980 (to 53%). There were similar (although insignificant) patterns for birds ringed as juveniles or adults. There were significant decreases in the proportion of recoveries that were shot following each piece of legislation, from 1917-1925 (59% of 29) to 1926-1939 (14% of 35) and again from 1945-1966 (17% of 76) to 1976-1980 (2% of 192).</p><p> </p>",

However, following the discontinuation of moor management in 2000, harriers declined again to two to four pairs in 2003-2006. Both species were legally protected since 1961, but until 1990 many were still killed illegally on the moor. Three wader species and red grouse <em>Lagopus lagopus</em> all declined following harrier protection and the cessation of management. Meadow pipits <em>Anthus pratensis </em>and stonechats <em>Saxicola rubicola</em> both declined as harriers increased but increased again after 2000. Carrion crows <em>Corvus corone </em>increased from 2000, after they were no longer shot by gamekeepers.</p><p> </p>",
