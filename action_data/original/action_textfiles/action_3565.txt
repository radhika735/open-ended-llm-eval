        "background_definitions": "<p>Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox <em>et al.</em> 2016). Synthetic materials used for fishing gear, such as nylon, may persist for decades leading to an accumulation of ‘ghost’ gear in marine and freshwater environments. Biodegradable fishing gear, which is naturally broken down by microbes or ultraviolet light, may offer an alternative to traditional materials (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2016) and help to reduce the impact of ‘ghost’ gear on reptiles. The degraded products of biodegradable materials (carbon dioxide, methane, water) also have no impact on marine ecosystems, unlike synthetic materials which eventually degrade into microplastics.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Kim S., Kim P., Lim J., An H. &amp; Suuronen P.
