High grazing pressure can degrade understory species diversity. This is mainly due to decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous and low woody species. Using wire fences to excluded livestock from regularly grazed forested areas may increase species diversity (Crawley 1983). Other studies aimed to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Prevent livestock grazing from forest areas’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Alkemade, R., Reid, R.

Bramble cover decreased by 30% in grazed plots and increased by 19% in ungrazed plots. In grazed plots frequencies of English ivy <em>Hedera helix</em> and common periwinkle <em>Vinca minor </em>decreased (30 vs 0%) <em> </em>(9 vs 0%) respectively, while the cover of oxlip <em>Primula elatior </em>remained similar (13 vs 12%). In ungrazed plots frequencies did not change for ivy (26 vs 24%), common periwinkle (5 vs 7%) and oxlip (16 vs 13%). Percentage cover and the abundance of wood anemone <em>Anemone nemorosa</em> were higher in ungrazed than in grazed plots (36 vs 22% cover, 230 vs 100 flowers/ plot respectively)<em>.</em> Bramble cover data were collected in 1998 and in 2008 in four plots (20 × 40 m) each divided to equal grazed and ungrazed subplots. Presence/absence of<em> ivy, common periwinkle and oxlip</em> (in 2002 and 2008), and cover and frequency of wood anemone<em> </em>(in 2008) were monitored in 206 grazed and 206-225 ungrazed 2 × 2 m plots. Grazing (0.25 cows/ha) began in 2004.</p><p> </p>",
