        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Long flexible habitats’ are flexible protruding materials such as rope, ribbon or twine &gt;50 mm in length (modified from “Soft structures” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Long flexible habitats, such as macroalgal canopies and soft-bodied invertebrates, provide other organisms three-dimensional habitat space and refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Levin &amp; Hay 1996; Smale <em>et al.</em> 2020). The size, density and material properties of flexible habitats are likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them and the spaces they create.</p>\r\n<p>Some organisms that form flexible habitats tend to be absent or sparse on artificial subtidal structures (Wilhelmsson &amp; Malm 2008), although some readily colonize in suitable conditions. Artificial flexible habitats such as ropes or nets can be present on some structures, but are likely to be temporary and regularly disturbed (e.g. removed and replaced) when present. Long flexible habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively. Material choice is important for creating flexible habitats, since some flexible materials are unlikely to persist in the marine environment, while those that do may become entanglement hazards or contribute to pollution if dislodged. Studies that investigate the effects of transplanting live soft-bodied organisms onto structures are not included here, but are considered under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3471\"><em>Transplant or seed organisms onto subtidal artificial structures</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p>There are bodies of literature describing the use of artificial flexible habitats to investigate the effects of structural complexity on ecological interactions in subtidal rocky habitats (e.g. Shelamoff <em>et al.</em> 2020), for artificial reefs or fish aggregation devices (e.g. Kellison &amp; Sedberry 1998; Vega Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2009), and for bivalve or seaweed cultivation (e.g. Peteiro <em>et al.</em> 2007; Walls <em>et al.</em> 2019). There are also laboratory-based studies investigating species preferences for different flexible habitats (e.g. Hellyer <em>et al.</em> 2011). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3450\"><em>Create short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3471\"><em> Transplant or seed organisms onto subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Hellyer C.B., Harasti D. &amp; Poore A.G.B.

In the first trial, after six weeks, fish species richness and abundance (excluding blennies <em>Parablennius</em> sp.) was similar under pontoons with ASUs (3–4 species/pontoon, 5–7 individuals/pontoon) and those without (1–2 species/pontoon, 2–4 individuals/pontoon). In the second trial, six weeks after clearing fishes from beneath pontoons, species richness and abundance was higher under pontoons with ASUs (4–5 species/pontoon, 6–11 individuals/pontoon) than without (0–1 species and individuals/pontoon). Blenny abundance was similar under pontoons with and without ASUs (0–17 vs 0–22 individuals/pontoon) in both trials. Three species recorded under pontoons with ASUs were absent from those without. Long flexible habitats (ASUs) were created by suspending steel mesh sheets (7 m<sup>2</sup>) with buoyant plastic fragments (length: 280 mm; density: 800/m<sup>2</sup>) under pontoons. One ASU was attached at 0.3 m depth under each of six randomly-selected pontoons in each of three sites within an estuary in September 1989. Fishes under pontoons with ASUs and under six without were netted (1 mm mesh size) and counted after six weeks. The trial was repeated in October after clearing fishes from under pontoons. Five ASUs were dislodged and no longer provided habitat.</p>",
