All five infected poison dart frogs treated were cured. Infection was eliminated from all but one midwife toadlet sprayed with voriconazole at 1.3 mg/L, but only four of seven sprayed at 0.13 mg/L. The one toad treated with 1.3 mg/L that was not cured was sprayed five (rather than one) months after infection. All toadlets housed on tissue soaked in voriconazole remained infected. No toxic side effects were seen. One week after experimental infection with the chytrid fungus, 14 toadlets were sprayed daily with voriconazole (1.3 or 0.13 mg/L water) and five were kept on paper towels soaked in voriconazole (1.3 mg/L) for seven days. Six animals were controls. Five months after experimental infection a further 20 toadlets were sprayed with voriconazole (1.3 mg/L) for 7 days. Animals were tested weekly for infection. A colony of 52 poison dart frogs, five positive for chytridiomycosis, was sprayed daily with voriconazole (1.3 mg/L) for seven days. Frogs containers were sterilized by heating to 45°C for three days.</p><p> </p>",
