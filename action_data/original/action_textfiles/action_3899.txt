On restored roadside prairies with herbicide restrictions, both the abundance (2.3 individuals/plot) and species richness (1.6 species/plot) of habitat-sensitive butterflies was higher than on roadsides with no herbicide restrictions and dominated by weeds (abundance: 1.4 individuals/plot; richness: 0.9 species/plot) or grasses (0.5 individuals/plot; 0.7 species/plot), and not significantly different from remnant prairies (1.6 individuals/plot; 1.7 species/plot). In addition, mortality risk was lower on prairie or weedy road verges than on non-native grass verges (data presented as model results). On eight well-established, restored prairie road verges (&gt;0.5 km long) and four native (never ploughed) prairie verges dominated by native prairie vegetation, the use of herbicides was restricted. Roadside vegetation (&gt;6 m wide) within 1.6 km of the 12 prairies, but with no restrictions on herbicide use, was classified as “weedy” (&gt;20% non-native legumes) or “grassy” (dominated by non-native grasses). From June–August 1998, butterflies were surveyed nine times in 1–3 plots/habitat (restored prairie, native prairie, weedy, grassy) at each of 12 sites. Plots were 50 × 5 m, &gt;50 m apart and &gt;500 m from a different verge habitat. In addition, three plots in each of four native prairie remnants (2–16 ha) were surveyed. Roadkill butterflies were surveyed six times along both road edges next to each plot.</p>",

There were more crescent butterflies on unsprayed, unmown transmission lines (2.7 individuals/visit) than on frequently sprayed lines mown twice/year (0.1 individuals/visit). However, the abundance and species richness of other native butterflies was not significantly different between transmission lines which were not sprayed or mown (abundance: 11 individuals/visit; richness: 32 species), unsprayed and mown (14 individuals/visit; 21 species), infrequently sprayed and mown (11 individuals/visit; 27 species), or frequently sprayed and mown (10 individuals/visit; 21 species). See paper for species results. Fifty-two road verges and power lines (&gt;30 m wide, &gt;400 m long) were managed in one of four ways: 21 were neither sprayed with herbicide nor mown, but some trees were removed; 14 were sprayed frequently with herbicide and mown twice/year with cuttings left on site; 10 were sprayed infrequently with herbicide and mown once/year with cuttings left on site; seven were not sprayed and were mown once/year with cuttings baled and removed. From 15 June–15 August 2007–2008, butterflies were surveyed on one 400- or 500-m transect at each site 2–4 times/year.</p>",
