Results were not statistically tested, and no distinction was made between nests relocated to the beach or hatchery. Hatching and emergence success were similar for relocated nests (hatching: 19–52%; emergence: 14–32%) and nests left in situ (hatching: 30–69%; emergence: 9–57%). In October–March 1999–2004, beaches were searched nightly for nesting females. In 2001–2004, nests considered to be at high risk (such as being within tidal zone, in areas of high pedestrian traffic, in vegetation or close to estuary) were relocated to safe places on the beach or a hatchery (86 nests), and others were left in situ (220 nests). Two days after emergence of the first hatchling, or 60 days after laying, nests were excavated to determine hatching and emergence success.</p>",

Nests in the tidal area (doomed nests) were relocated close to one of 23 natural nests laid further up the beach (23 locations further up the beach, with 2 relocated nests and 1 natural nest/location).
