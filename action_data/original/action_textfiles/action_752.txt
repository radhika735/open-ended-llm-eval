Growing trees in rows within fields is included under 'Use alley cropping'. Ground-dwelling invertebrates (such as ground beetles and spiders) are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water. Pitfall trap measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground, therefore studies refer to ‘activity densities’.</p>\r\n<p>Here we present evidence from four of six studies.</p>",

Other ground beetle (Carabidae) species, including <em>Pterostiehus melanarius</em>,<em> </em>had similar numbers or were only slightly more numerous in the hedge than the crop. Ground beetle diversity in the crop declined with distance from the hedge. The hedge was planted in 1995 and comprised two 200 m sections of shrubs divided by a 100 m section of mixed fodder crops (oat <em>Avena sativa</em> and cabbage <em>Brassica oleracea</em>). It was separated from the adjacent barley crop by a 9 m-wide zone planted with oats and sorghum <em>Sorghum bicolor</em>. Ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps in the hedge (15 traps) and at intervals between 10-110 m from the hedge in the adjacent crop (four traps at each of five distances). Traps were emptied every 2-4 weeks (April to mid-October 1996). Fenced pitfall traps (12 in the hedge and three 110 m into the crop) were used to estimate absolute densities and were emptied every day for eight days in June 1996.</p>",

During the dry season, there were more wasps (Hymenoptera) near hedges of croton <em>Croton megalocarpus</em>, gliricidia <em>Gliricidia sepium</em>, mulberry<em> Morus alba</em>, siamea <em>Senna siamea</em> and spectabilis <em>Senna spectabilis</em> (averaging 19-25 wasps/trap) compared to other hedge species (10-15 wasps). Spiders (Araneae) were more abundant near hedges of calliandra <em>Calliandra calothyrsus</em>, croton, grevillea <em>Grevillea robusta</em>, lantana <em>Lantana camara</em> and siamea than other hedge species. Hedge type did not affect ladybird (Coccinellidae) or aphid (Aphidoidea) abundance or levels of pest infestation in beans and maize. Hedges were planted 8 m upslope of 10 x 10 m plots in 1993 using nine tree/shrub species (as above, plus flemingea <em>Flemingia macrophylla</em>) and pruned to 0.5 m. Beans were grown in the short- and maize in the long-rain season. There were four replicates/hedge species. Two yellow pan traps and two pitfall traps were placed in each plot (one of each near the hedge, one of each 4 m away) and monitored every 10 days.</p>",

There were four replicates of each treatment in 15 x 12 m plots. A year before sampling, hedges of one Napier grass and one calliandra row (50 cm apart) were planted on the upper and lower edges of the plots.
