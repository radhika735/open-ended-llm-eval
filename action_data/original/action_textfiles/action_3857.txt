        "background_definitions": "<p>Climate change threatens butterfly and moth species by shifting areas of suitable climatic conditions away from species’ historic ranges. For most species, this leads to areas at lower latitudes becoming less climatically suitable, and areas at higher latitudes becoming more suitable (Mason <em>et al.</em> 2015). To survive, butterfly and moth populations must be able to move polewards across the landscape, between suitable habitat patches, but this movement is hindered by habitat loss and fragmentation. Enhancing natural habitat to improve landscape connectivity may enable species to move, and adapt their distribution to cope with climate change.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on improving habitat to facilitate elevational range shifts, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3856\"><em>Protect and connect habitat along elevational gradients</em></a>”. For studies on creating habitat refuges for species less able to alter their distribution, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3859\"><em>Create microclimate and microhabitat refuges</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Mason S.C., Palmer G., Fox R., Gillings S., Hill J.K., Thomas C.D. &amp; Oliver T.H.
