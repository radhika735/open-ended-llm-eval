Levels of amoebic gill disease were 47% and 22%, respectively. Two cages with a diameter of 60m and three of 80m diameter were used for the study. Average biomass per pen was 2337 kg for the 60m cages and 2806 kg for the 80m cages. Monthly samples were taken from August to November. Signs of clinical disease were assessed using the routine Tasmanian salmon farmers gill assessment method.</p><p>Â </p>",
