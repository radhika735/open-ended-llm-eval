Several wetland-riparian species (e.g. common snipe <em>Gallinago gallinago</em>, green-backed heron <em>Butorides striatus</em> and solitary sandpiper <em>Tringa solitaria</em>) were more frequent or only occurred in controls. The authors suggest differences are largely due to simplified vegetation structure and reduced cover.

Red-winged blackbirds <em>Agelaius phoeniceus</em> and American robins <em>Turdus migratorius</em> increased more on grazed pastures, as did species able to tolerate a moderate range of environmental conditions. However, willow flycatchers <em>Empidonax traillii </em>and species able to tolerate either a wide range of conditions or a very narrow range may have increased more on ungrazed pastures.
