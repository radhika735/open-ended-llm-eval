        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">As well as physically moving birds to areas (translocations, see separate intervention), it is possible to try and get birds to move of their own accord. Many birds nest colonially for protection and are attracted nesting to areas with conspecifics. Especially for birds that land mainly at night, hearing the calls and other vocalisations of conspecifics may be an important part of guiding them to colonies. Playing recordings of these calls may therefore encourage birds to colonise new areas. A similar intervention is ‘Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
