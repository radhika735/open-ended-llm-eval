        "background_definitions": "<p>In hook and line fishing, a fishing line is set with single or multiple baited hooks to attract fish. Whilst hook and line fishing is generally considered to be relatively selective, resulting in less unwanted catch than other gears, the type of hook used can influence the species and size of fish captured as well as the extent of hooking injury. Larger hooks, for example, may be effective at avoiding capture of smaller unwanted fish, whilst hooks of different shapes can also affect catch composition. Circle hooks, for example, are hooks on which the point is curved backwards in a circular shape, perpendicular to the main shaft, as opposed to a ‘J’ hook, which has the point parallel to the main shaft. Circle hooks may therefore reduce the incidence of hook swallowing in captured fish, minimising the severity of hooking injury and increasing survival in unwanted catch after release. Other modifications may include attaching inedible objects to hooks to act as deterrents to smaller fish or modifying the configuration of hooks on the mainline, such as changing the attachments.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under <em>‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use a different bait type</a>’ and ‘<a href=\"../../actions/2699\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modify longline configuration</a>’</em>.

Data were not tested for statistical significance. Overall, the average length of fish caught (34 fish species/groups and one octopus species) was larger for bigger hook sizes (largest hook: 30 cm; intermediate: 29 cm; smallest: 29 cm), but no increase in average size was found for most species, and all hooks caught a wide range of species (see original paper for species individual data). There were small increases however for four of the seven most abundant fish species in catches. Average catch weights were lowest for the largest hook size (largest hook: 77 kg, intermediate: 110 kg, smallest: 107 kg). A total of 45 longlines were deployed from March 1994 to March 1995 in water depths of 13–20 m. Hooks tested were a type commonly used by local small-scale fishers: round bent, flattened sea hooks (Mustad type) in three sizes: 11 (largest), 13 (intermediate, most widely used) and 15 (smallest) (see paper for hook dimensions). Individual longlines with 200–300 hooks of each size (39,900 total hooks) baited with razor clam were deployed for 2–4 h at a time. Catches were separated by hook type and species, weighed and fish total length measured.</p>",

Across all fish species (five targeted and three non-targeted), catch rates were lower with large sized hooks (2.2 fish/0.5 h) than small (2.9 fish/0.5 h), and there were no differences between hook designs (offset circle: 2.5, non-offset circle: 2.8, J hook: 2.3 fish/0.5 h). Individually, catch rates of two species were lower using large hooks, and catch rate of one species was lower with both circle hook types than J-hooks (see original paper for species individual data). For all eight species combined, the percentage of fish caught with hooking injuries was reduced with non-offset circle hooks (non-offset circle: 3.7%, offset circle: 6.9%, J hook: 7.8%) and small hook sizes (small: 3.9%, large: 9.0%). Fishing trials took place on four research vessels (25 fishing sessions) during January–October 2005 within the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland (9–50 m depths). A total of six hooks were tested each session: size 4/0 and 8/0 J hooks, 5/0 and 8/0 offset (by 12°) circle hooks, and 5/0 and 8/0 non-offset circle hooks. Fishers were randomly assigned a hook-type at the start of a session and each hook was fished for 30 minutes in a sequential order, baited with pilchard. Captured fish were identified, counted and recorded as injured or uninjured.</p>",

However, seven other comparisons across five studies found no differences in mortality between hook types for each of the four billfish species. In addition, five of seven comparisons in five of six studies reported lower deep-hooking rates (associated with higher mortality) with circle hooks for white and striped marlin and sailfish, and two studies found no effect for white marlin. A quantitative review of hook effects (circle vs J hooks) on billfishes was conducted by searches of published and grey literature via library and electronic database records, as well as communications with agencies and individuals conducted by the author.

Using circle hooks alone caught fewer sharks and rays than using J-shaped hooks or a combination of J and circle hooks, and fishing in July–December resulted in fewer shark and ray captures, compared to fishing in January–March (data reported as statistical model results and odds ratios). In addition, using larger size bait and shorter (&lt;17 m) distances between secondary lines attached to the mainline reduced the incidental capture of rays (data reported as statistical model results and odds ratios). Data from 2,367 gear deployments were obtained from the Fiji Observer Programme for the Fiji longline fishery covering the period January 2011 to December 2014. Data were analysed to assess the effect of different factors on incidental capture of sharks and rays. These included hook type (J-shaped and circle hooks), bait sizes (large and small), distances between the branching lines on the mainline, years and season.</p>",

Ringed hooks caught fewer unwanted sunfish <em>Mola mola</em> (0.04 ind/1,000 hooks) and blue shark <em>Prionace glauca </em>(0.04 ind/1,000 hooks) compared to non-ringed hooks (sunfish: 0.08, blue shark: 0.19 ind/1,000 hooks). However, numbers of unwanted pelagic stingray <em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em> were higher on ringed hooks than non-ringed hook (ringed: 0.71, non-ringed: 0.63 ind/1,000 hooks). Target swordfish and bluefin tuna <em>Thunnus thynnus </em>catches were higher on ringed hooks than non-ringed hooks (swordfish: 8.47 vs 6.65, tuna: 0.71 vs 0.47 ind/1,000 hooks). Catches of targeted little tunny <em>Euthynnus alletteratus</em> were similar between hook types (both 0.04 ind/1,000 hooks) but target dolphinfish <em>Coryphaena hippurus </em>catches were lower on ringed hooks (ringed: 0.00, non-ringed: 0.04 ind/1,000 hooks). Fishing trials took place in July–September in 2009–2013 using ringed or non-ringed circle hooks (size 16/0). Hooks were 5 cm long and either attached to the branchline with a ring or directly to the line, with each type set alternately along the mainline. Sixty-five sets of gear were fished from six vessels, totalling 50,800 hooks.</p>",

Data were reported as statistical results – see original paper. There was no difference between hook types in catch rates of seven of 13 species, whilst catch rates of six of 13 unwanted shark species were higher on circle hooks than on J hooks. Mortality upon gear retrieval was lower for three of ten shark species on circle hooks than J hooks, and similar for seven species. Catches of target tuna <em>Thunnus</em> spp., billfishes <em>Istiophoridae</em> and swordfish <em>Xiphiidae</em> were higher on circle hooks than J hooks in five of 13 cases and lower in two cases. The systematic review summarized the effects of using circle hooks in longline fisheries compared to conventional J hooks on catch rates and at-vessel mortality during gear retrieval from 42 studies.</p>",
