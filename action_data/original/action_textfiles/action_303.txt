Nets fitted with highly visible mesh in the top 10% caught significantly fewer guillemots than controls (0.32 vs. 0.6 entanglements/net), but there was no significant change in the number of auklets caught. Nets with 25% high visibility mesh also caught significantly fewer sockeye salmon <em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em>, the target species, compared to controls (10 vs. 36 entanglements/net). A total of eight boats and 482 net sets were studied.</p><p> </p>",
