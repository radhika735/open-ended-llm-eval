Singing birds were surveyed in the 1980-1981 breeding seasons. Greentree reservoir management reduced understory vegetation and bird species that are primarily understory foragers were absent or at lower frequencies, and nesting opportunities for ground- or understorey- nesting species were reduced, compared to the control. Canopy-foraging species were not affected. There were overall fewer breeding species and bird abundance was lower at the greentree reservoir site.</p><p> </p>",
