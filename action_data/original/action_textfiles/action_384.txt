Reductions in foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> and carrion crows <em>Corvus corone</em> led to an average threefold increase in the percentage of pairs fledging young of lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus</em>, golden plover <em>Pluvialis apricaria</em>, curlew <em>Numenius arquata</em>, red grouse <em>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</em> and meadow pipit <em>Anthus pratensis</em>; and subsequently led to increases in breeding numbers (? 14%/year) of lapwing, curlew, golden plover and red grouse, all of which declined in the absence of predator control (? 17%/year). There was no significant effect of predator culling for any wader species. Predator culling reduced the abundance of fox by 43% and crow 78%.</p><p> </p>",
