After 25 months, average vegetation cover did not differ between sown plots with or without an erosion blanket (both 3%). In November 1988, the site was ploughed to a depth of 10 cm. In December 1988, seeds (a mix of six grasses and one legume) were sown using a seed drill in two 60 x 1.8 m plots in each of five blocks. One plot/block was covered with woven jute netting, and the other plot was left uncovered. In January 1991, thirty 0.25-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats were placed in each plot and vegetation cover estimated by eye.</p><p> </p>",

Vegetation cover was not significantly different in areas where an erosion control blanket was used, seeds were sown, and plants were planted (0.6–12.3%) and areas where no erosion control blanket was used but seeds were sown and plants planted (2.7–10.5%). In October 1993, three blocks each containing two plots, were established on road verges. An erosion control blanket made of aspen <em>Populus</em> sp. shavings and plastic netting was added to one plot that was then sown with seeds of 13 grass, forb, and shrub species and planted with the same plant species. One plot was planted with plants and sown with seeds but no erosion control blanket was added. Vegetation cover in each plot was recorded in June 1994–1997.</p>",

In four of four comparisons, plant density was higher in plots where seeds were sown and an organic blanket was used (4–34 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) than in plots where seeds were sown and no blanket was used (1–11 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). A similar pattern was seen in four of four comparisons for plant species richness (with organic blanket: 0.4–3.2 species/0.25 m<sup>2</sup>; without organic blanket: 0.2–1.8 species/0.25 m<sup>2</sup>). In November 2009, forty 5 x 5 m plots were sown with locally collected seeds of seven native grass and forb species. An organic blanket (biodegradable net made of straw and alpha grass <em>Stipa tenacissima</em>) was randomly added to half of the plots, while the other half had no blanket added. Four different bedding materials were applied to plots prior to seeding (see original paper for details). Plant density and species richness were estimated in July and October 2010 using fifteen randomly placed 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats/plot.</p>",
