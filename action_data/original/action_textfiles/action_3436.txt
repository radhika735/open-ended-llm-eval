        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats’ are adjoining internal cavities sheltered from, but with access to/from, outside the structure. Dimensions can vary but are ≤100 mm in any direction.</p>\r\n<p>Small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats are not well-studied in subtidal rocky habitats. They may form through weathering of softer rocks, amongst loosely-consolidated cobbles/boulders, or within three-dimensional structures created by living organisms. They likely provide organisms refuge from predation, in the same way crevice and hole habitats do (Mercader <em>et al.</em> 2019; Nelson &amp; Vance 1979). They could also serve as corridors, connecting adjacent refuge habitats. The size and density of cavities or swimthroughs is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, cavities and swimthroughs contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Cavities/swimthroughs are sometimes present on marine artificial structures made of consolidated boulders or blocks (Sherrard <em>et al.</em> 2016) or gabion baskets (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2014), but are absent from many other structures. Small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating swimthrough habitats on artificial reefs (e.g. Brotto <em>et al.</em> 2006; Hylkema <em>et al.</em> 2020; Noordin Raja Omar <em>et al.</em> 1994). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3434\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3454\"><em> Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3456\"><em>Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Brotto D.S., Krohling W., Brum S. &amp; Zalmon I.R.

After one month, juvenile spiny lobsters and blue-and-yellow groupers, sea firs, and adult damselfish/clownfish (Pomacentridae), wrasse (Labridae), butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae), squirrelfish/soldierfish (Holocentridae) and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) were recorded on and around anchor-weights with swimthrough habitats and environmentally-sensitive material. Small swimthrough habitats were created by attaching basalt rocks or semi-cylindrical tiles to the horizontal surfaces of concrete anchor-weights placed over a seabed pipeline (400 mm diameter). Basalt may be considered an environmentally-sensitive material compared with concrete. Large swimthrough habitats were also created between the anchor-weights and pipeline. Habitat dimensions/numbers were not reported. A total of 260 anchor-weights were placed with one every 10 m along the pipeline at 0–26 m depth during December 2009–March 2010.

Over 17 months, juvenile seabream (four species) used swimthrough habitats created on seawalls as frequently as those created under pontoons, and in three of six comparisons, they used both more than seawall and pontoon surfaces without swimthroughs, but in the other three comparisons no significant difference was found (data reported as habitat preference index). Abundances on and around swimthroughs and seawall and pontoon surfaces varied depending on the species, development stage, site and survey month (swimthroughs: 0–6 individuals/survey for any one species; seawall and pontoon: both 0–2/survey; see paper for results). Small swimthrough habitats were created by attaching steel cages containing oyster shells (Biohuts: height: 0.8 m; length: 0.5 m; width: 0.3 m; mesh size: 25–50 mm) to seawalls and pontoons in March 2013. Eight Biohuts were attached to each of three vertical seawalls, and three were suspended under each of three pontoons, in each of five marinas (depth not reported). Biohuts were compared with seawall (height: 0.8 m; length: 5 m) and pontoon (4 m<sup>2</sup>) surfaces without swimthroughs.
