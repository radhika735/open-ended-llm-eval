They reproduce relatively quickly and their small size and low maintenance requirements allow viable populations to be managed much more cost-effectively than many larger animals. Also unlike higher vertebrates that possess many learned behaviours that may reduce survival in the wild, the hard-wired physiology and behaviour of amphibians means that pre- and post-release training are not required. However, before release consideration must be given to genetic management, health screening, acclimation of animals, long-term monitoring and involvement of local stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Studies investigating captive breeding and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=152\">release of specific groups of amphibians</a></span> are discussed in separate sections.

Seven species (2 toad; 3 frog; 2 newt) showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations (high success), five species (3 toad; 2 frog) showed some evidence of breeding (partial success) and two species (1 toad; 1 frog) only showed evidence of survival following release (low success). Three programmes were considered unsuccessful and the outcome was not known for the other 19. Species from 16 countries were involved in these release programmes, with a bias towards temperate countries. Half of the species were classified in the top four highest IUCN threat categories (i.e. vulnerable to extinct in the wild).</p><p> </p>",
