Golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em> and common ravens <em>Corvus corax</em> were the species most commonly observed successfully overcoming deterrent devices (76% of deterrent-line sightings). More raptors perched on wires (rather than pylons) on perch-deterrent lines (228 compared to 11 sightings on control lines; 68% of sightings were rough-legged hawks <em>Buteo lagopus</em>).</p><p class=\"\\\"> </p><p> </p>",
