Nest cavity occupation by both species was unaffected by the clearance of midstory hardwood vegetation in woodpecker territories (17 sites cleared of hardwood: 51% of cavities occupied by woodpeckers, 22% by squirrels; seven sites not cleared: 52% occupied by woodpeckers, 27% occupied by squirrels). Midstory vegetation is often assumed to encourage flying squirrels.</p><p> </p>",
