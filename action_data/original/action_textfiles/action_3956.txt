Butterfly species richness and density were higher on grasslands where grazing was stopped two to nine years before (richness: 22–34 species, density: 201–688 butterflies/0.25 ha), than on sites where grazing stopped ≥10 years before (richness: 19–30 species, density: 130–876 butterflies/0.25 ha) or on currently grazed pastures (richness: 7–28 species, density: 36–489 butterflies/0.25 ha). Seven surveys were carried out in May–August 2000, at 48 unforested 0.25–6 ha grassland sites (10 grazed two to nine years before, 15 grazed ≥10 years before, 23 currently grazed). Butterflies and day-flying moths were surveyed along a 350 m transect within a 0.25 ha study plot at each site to calculate density, and then along a transect outside the plot which was proportionate to the size of the site to record all species. Butterfly density was measured as the number of individuals seen within the study plot transect.</p>",

Over seven years after abandonment, species which prefer grasslands declined in abundance, and species which prefer woodland and bramble hedges increased. The abundance of “generalist” butterfly species (which are able to persist in a wide range of habitats) and species with only one generation/year increased in abandoned meadows, while the abundance of “specialist” species (with specific habitat requirements) and species with multiple generations/year decreased. One grassland specialist, the silver-studded blue <em>Plebejus argus</em>, went extinct in some abandoned meadows. There was little change in the butterfly community in the continuously managed meadow. All data presented as model results. In 1997, six traditional hay meadows (0.55–3.71 ha) were managed normally: two were mown in June, and four were mown in June and August and grazed by cows in winter. From 1998–2004, five of the meadows were abandoned, but the sixth meadow continued to be mown in June and grazed by cattle and horses in winter. From March–September 1997–2004, butterflies were surveyed once/week along a fixed 1,122-m transect through the meadows (117–286 m/meadow), and the total number of each species recorded in each meadow each year was compared.</p>",

Pastures (15–31 ha) were managed in one of three ways: 1) rotational burning, with a third of each pasture burned annually in spring 2007–2009 and cattle grazing May–October annually (five pastures), 2) complete pasture burning in spring 2008 or 2009 and cattle grazing May–October annually (four pastures), or 3) complete pasture burning in spring 2008 or 2009 without grazing (four pastures).
