        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See <a href=\"../../data/index?terms=Breed%20reptiles%20in%20captivity&amp;yt0=\">here for other species groups</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see <a href=\"../../actions/3771\"><em>Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild</em>.</a></p>",

For three years the wild-caught pair did not reproduce, but in 1971–1977, the snakes and their offspring produced 12 litters of 17–25 young. At least four litters came from the wild-caught snakes, and at least four came from their captive-born offspring. A total of 20 young from three litters were stillborn, and five undeveloped eggs were produced. Seven of eight litters that were sexed at birth had sex ratios skewed slightly towards females, with females making up 55% of young. In 1964–1966, a pair of adult death adders were acquired and after the original male died in 1971, a new male was introduced. Adders were housed in various aquaria (60 x 30 cm to 150 x 45 cm in size), with a substrate of gravel and leaf litter. All aquaria were exposed to ambient temperatures.</p>",

Hatching success of viable eggs ranged from 41–61% (clutch a: 11 of 18 eggs hatched, clutch b: 14 of 24 eggs hatched, clutch c: 5 of 12 eggs hatched). Twenty-six of 30 hatchlings survived at least one year in captivity. In 1996, Madras Crocodile Bank acquired four female and three male adult king cobras from Indian zoos or from government seizures from snake collectors. Snakes were housed in indoor enclosures (see original paper for husbandry details). Eggs were incubated individually on damp vermiculite substrate (1:0.8 vermiculite: water by weight) at temperatures of 27.5–33°C. Egg viability and hatching success was evaluated after emergence.</p>",
