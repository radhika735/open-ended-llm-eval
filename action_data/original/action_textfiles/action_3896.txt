Six-metre-wide grass buffer strips were created on two arable farms in 2004 and managed under an Entry Level Stewardship agreement from 2005. In April 2008, three pairs of 25 × 4 m plots were established at each farm. One random plot/pair was sprayed with a grass-specific herbicide (“fluazifop-P-butyl”), and the other was left unsprayed. All plots were cut to 15 cm in autumn, and cuttings left in place.

Six male plants were sprayed with water and placed in a smaller, 0.75-m radius circle inside the female plants. The plants were exposed to natural pollination overnight.
