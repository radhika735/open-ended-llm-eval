Pens or enclosures may increase the chance that released animals will settle at the release site, potentially increasing the chance that the release will be successful. Captive-bred, naïve animals in particular may benefit from the acclimation period that holding pens provide.</p>\r\n<p>This action discusses studies that test the effectiveness of placing captive-bred individuals into holding pens at the release site prior to release.

Soft-released snakes were recaptured a similar number of times (13 recaptures/snakes) compared to hard-released snakes (6 recaptures/snake) over 3–5 months following release. Soft-released snakes moved less than residents (soft-released: 2 m/day; residents: 5 m/day), but movement of hard-released snakes (2 m/day) was similar to both soft-released and resident snakes. Eighteen captive-bred and reared snakes (≥9 g) were released in 2011 via soft-release (9 snakes; released in to 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 enclosure, held for 3 weeks before final release) or hard-release (9 snakes, released directly). Monitoring was completed by radiotracking and checking under coverboards on the ground at least 5 days/week for the first week, then 3 times/week for 3–5 months. Snake growth was also monitored, but only in captivity. <strong> </strong></p>",

First-year survivorship of tortoises initially released into holding enclosures was similar (9 of 12, 75% tortoises survived) compared to those that were direct-released into the same sites (12 of 15, 80% tortoises survived). Overall survivorship of released head-started juvenile desert tortoises was 32% over three years (17 of 53 tortoises survived). In the first year after release, 42 of 53 (81%) tortoises survived, in the second year after release 32 of 42 (76%) tortoises survived and in the third year after release 17 of 32 (53%) tortoises survived. Survivorship also was similar between tortoises released in the autumn compared to the spring (see original paper for details). In autumn 2005, twelve head-started tortoises were initially placed in temporary predator-proof enclosures in three sites (4 tortoises/site), 15 head-started tortoises were direct-released in the same three sites (5/site), and a further 16 head-started tortoises were direct-released in a fourth site. In spring and autumn 2006, ten further head-started tortoises were released into the fourth site. Tortoises housed in predator-proof enclosures (each 45 m<sup>2</sup>) were enclosed from September 2005–January 2006. All tortoises were radio-tracked weekly-biweekly during active seasons and monthly during inactive seasons from release until autumn 2008 (up to three years). Tortoises were recaptured twice/year while radio tracked for a health check.</p>",
