Preventing people from approaching birds too closely may help reduce disturbance. We found two studies that investigated the distances at which birds were disturbed by people: one found that people on foot disturbed birds at greater distances than people in boats (Rodgers &amp; Smoth 1995); the second found that different species reacted differently to disturbance (Rodgers &amp; Schwikert 2002). Both recommended buffer zones of between 100 and 180 m around breeding or feeding birds.</p>\r\n<p>Rodgers, J.A. &amp; Smith, H.T.
