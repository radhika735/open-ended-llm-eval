The purchase or ‘buyback’ of fishing vessels from fishers is a potential management tool to remove capacity from a fleet and reduce the effects of overfishing on fish populations. Removal of vessels may lead to increased fish biomass in the short term; however, long-term success may depend on whether the most productive vessels are removed and whether fishers subsequently re-enter the fishery after purchasing another vessel (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>\r\n<p>See also ‘<em>Implement vessel decommissioning schemes</em>’.</p>\r\n<p>Teh L.S.L., Hotte N. &amp; Sumaila U.R.
