In total, 16 of 108 released accidentally-caught or head-started immature green turtles were recaptured. Nine turtles were recovered within 10 months, other recaptured turtles had spent up to 27 months in the wild. Most turtles were recaptured a few hundred metres to 14 km away from their point of release, except for one head-started turtle that was recaptured 2,315 km away from the release site after 10 months. In 1967–1971, eighty-nine green turtles were head-started in Costa Rica and released after approximately two years on the north and south coasts of Bermuda. In addition, 19 wild-born immature green turtles caught accidentally by local fisherman were tagged and released as part of the same programme.</p>",

Longline-caught turtles travelled similar total distances (117–520 nautical miles) and distances each day (5 nautical miles/day) compared to free-swimming turtles (total distance: 50–443 nautical miles; 5 nautical miles/day). Longline-caught turtles made similar depth daily maximum dives (81–408 m) compared to free-swimming turtles (84–264 m). Longline-caught turtles made more deeper daytime dives than free-swimming turtles, which were more likely to make deeper dives at night (no statistical tests carried out, see original paper for details). None of the longline-caught turtles died during the study; one free-swimming turtle mortality occurred. In total nine olive ridley turtles <em>Lepidochelys olivacea</em> and one green turtle <em>Chelonia mydas </em>caught by fishermen were monitored using radio tags in November 2001–August 2003. Hooks were removed from the turtle’s jaw or mouth (except for one individual, see paper for details) and turtles were released. At the same time, five free-swimming olive ridley turtles were collected by the boat, radio-tagged and released for behavioural comparisons. On average, tags remained on line-caught turtles and free-swimming turtles for 54 and 60 days respectively.</p>",

Turtles survived for at least 17–314 days and moved 36–1,393 km after being released.
