After seven years, plant species richness in areas where seeds were sown (31.2 species/plot) did not differ significantly from that found in areas where no seeds were sown (47.8 species/plot), but both had fewer species than nearby intact dry grasslands (62.4 species/plot). The number of grassland species followed a similar trend (seeded: 19.7 species/plot, unseeded: 24.6 species/plot, intact grassland: 55.6 species/plot) as did the cover of grassland species (seeded: 74.3%, unseeded: 68.7%, intact grassland: 102.7%). Between one and 11 years before the start of the study, 35 restored sites were sown with a seed mix containing 44 local plant species at a rate of 17–20 kg/ha and 16 sites were not sown with seed. Twenty-five intact dry grassland sites were also used as a comparison. In 2009–2011, three 5 x 5 m plots were placed in each site and cover of all plant species visually estimated.</p>",
