The plot was burned in March 1967, after which fire excluded, with annual burns in the surrounding woodland. Species of more open habitat (e.g. blue grosbeak <em>Passerina caerulea</em> and Bachman\\'s sparrow <em>Aimophila aestivalis</em>) disappeared within five years of fire exclusion although abundance of species peaked during the ‘brushy’ stage (years 3-7) and mesic woodland species (e.g. wood thrush <em>Hylocichla mustelina</em>) appeared following sub-canopy development. The total number of species recorded regularly in the plot fluctuated between 15 and 29 species. Numbers of red-cockaded woodpecker <em>Picoides borealis </em>declined (over the site as a whole) over the study period.</p><p> </p>",
