Similar numbers of plant species were found in plots with compost or mineral fertilizer (12–18 species). <strong>Methods: </strong>Compost was added to four plots (2007–2009: 30; 2010–2013: 15 Mg/ha dry weight). Mineral fertilizer was added to four other plots (NPK fertilizer, twice/year, 50 kg/ha). The plots were 10 x 5 m. The compost was made from municipal solid waste and urban yard trimmings. The compost was added, and plots were tilled, in April each year (20 cm depth). Horticultural crops were grown in 2007–2011. In March 2012 and 2013, all plants (spontaneous growth) were collected from 1 x 1 m quadrats in each plot.</p><p> </p>",
