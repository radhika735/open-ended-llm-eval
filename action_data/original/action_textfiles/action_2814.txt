However, knowledge exchange between fishers could also be used as a tool to help promote sustainable practices, particularly if the central fishers in information-sharing networks can be identified and co-opted to assist managers in the spreading of conservation information (Mbaru &amp; Barnes 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Mbaru E.K. &amp; Barnes M.L.
