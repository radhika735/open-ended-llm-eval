Overall bog turtle captures and density in formerly grazed sites (captures: 3 individuals/site; density: 8 turtles/ha) was lower than in currently grazed sites (6, 25). Juvenile turtles were found less frequently in formerly sites (33%) compared to currently grazed sites (75%). Each hectare of 12 formerly grazed (no livestock for at least 10 years) and 12 grazed (under constant grazing for &gt;50 years; 11 grazed by cattle, one by horses) sites were visually searched for a total of 15 hours over at least three visits in April–September 2000–2001.

Overall reptile and amphibian abundance was similar in ungrazed areas compared to areas that were grazed, burned or grazed and burned (results presented as statistical model outputs). However, abundance of <em>Lampropholis delicata </em>was higher in ungrazed plots with no burning (14 skinks/plot) compared to plots with grazing and/or burning (grazed: 4 skinks/plot; burned: 3 skinks/plot; grazed and burned: 1 skink/plot). Para-grass dominated habitat in a conservation park (3,245 ha) was divided into 12 plots (200 x 300 m each) and each plot was either left unmanaged (no grazing or burning), grazed, burned, or grazed and burned (3 plots/management type). Burning took place in August 2004, September 2005 and November 2006. Cattle <em>Bos indicus </em>grazing took place after burning in September–December 2004, October–December 2005 and November–December 2006. Livestock levels were calculated to consume 50% of the grass biomass present/plot. Reptile and frog communities were sampled four times between 2005–2007 using three pitfall/funnel trap arrays/plot (see original paper for details). Reptiles were individually marked by toe clipping prior to release.</p>",
