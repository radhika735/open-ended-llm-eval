Management included the removal of 2,304 southern flying squirrels <em>Glaucomys volans</em> (a competitor for, and kleptoparasite of, woodpecker cavities) from the site. Of the squirrels removed, 1,511 (66%) were from artificial cavities, 652 (28%) from natural cavities and 141 (6%) from nest boxes. Other interventions included the provision of artificial cavities and nest boxes (see ‘General responses to small/declining populations – Provide artificial nesting sites’), fitting artificial cavities with restrictor plates to prevent them being enlarged by other woodpeckers (see ‘Protect nest sties from competitors’). Other interventions included translocations of adults and fledglings and habitat management and are discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations – Translocate individuals’ and ‘Threat: Natural system modifications – Forest modifications’.</p><p> </p>",

Instead, there was an increase in occupancy by red-bellied woodpeckers <em>Melanerpes carolinus</em>, another cavity kleptoparasite (1 cavity/territory occupied vs. 0.69 cavities/territory for experimental and control sites respectively). This increase was most noticeable between July-December (a 103% increase compared to controls), when most fledgling red-cockaded woodpeckers acquire cavities.</p><p> </p>",
