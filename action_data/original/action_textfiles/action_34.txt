A detailed study of nest sites used by the stingless bee species <em>Melipona quadrifasciata</em> in 18 km2 of degraded cerrado (72 plots, each 500 m2) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, found that they almost exclusively nested in <em>C. brasiliense</em> (Antonini &amp; Martins 2003). Forty-six out of 48 nests were found in that species, although there were 55 tree species at the site. The authors argue that <em>M. quadrifasciata </em>is only found in the area because of the protection of <em>C. brasiliense.</em></p>",
