Opening up patches within the forest may create new habitat for these species.

In 2006, there were five pearl-bordered fritillary breeding sites in Tytherley Woods, and in 2011, after habitat management, there were 12 sites, and most populations were stable or increasing (details not provided). However, in nearby woodland without management there were 10 pearl-bordered fritillary breeding sites in 2006 and seven in 2011. In Denge Woods in 2007 there were 11 Duke of Burgundy butterflies recorded across two sites, and in 2010 after habitat management there were 173 butterflies across 10 sites (although two of these sites had not been surveyed in 2007). Results were not tested for statistical significance. In 2007–2011 habitat management was conducted in Tytherley Woods, Hampshire/Wiltshire and Denge Woods, Kent, which included clearing derelict coppice, felling non-native conifer plantations, cutting and grazing clearings and widening rides. Butterfly surveys were conducted in 2006–2010 in sites which pearl-bordered fritillary and Duke of Burgundy butterflies were known to occupy and in other suitable habitat patches.</p>",

In 2002, prior to felling and scrub control, an average of seven high brown fritillary adults/hour were recorded at the site, and seven years after felling and scrub clearance began 14 adults/hour were recorded. Small pearl-bordered fritillary also increased in number between 2003 and 2011 (numbers not given). From 2003–2011 some large trees were felled and some patches of bracken <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em>, bramble <em>Rubus fruticosus</em> agg., honeysuckle <em>Lonicera periclymenum</em> and tree saplings were cut back in the Alun Valley, a 254 ha landscape comprising woodland, heathland and grassland.

In wide woodland rides, the abundance of macro-moths (1,926 individuals) was lower than in standard rides (2,513 individuals) and mature forest (2,479 individuals). Species richness was similar between wide (175 species) and standard (176 species) rides and mature forest (180 species). However, wide rides and coppiced woodland supported 49 species not found in standard rides or mature forest, and 124 species were more abundant in wide rides and coppiced woodland than in standard rides and mature forest, especially ‘common but severely declining’ species (see paper for details). Only 22 species were found in standard rides or mature forest but not wide rides or coppiced woodland. Within six woodlands (8–711 ha), six areas under each of six management types were studied: young (1–2 years), medium (3–6 years) and old (7–9 years) coppice, wide (&gt;20 m) and standard (&lt;10 m) rides, and non-coppiced mature forest. From July–October 2010, macro-moths were sampled nine times/site using a 6 W Heath actinic light trap, over 27 nights (two sites/management type sampled/night).</p>",
