There were increases in the number of plant species under intensive grazing in the area that had the fewest plant species at the start of the experiment, abandoned 14 years before, but colonization was very slow. Wavy hair grass decreased the most under normal grazing, reducing from 92 to 70% cover on average, intensive grazing had a lesser effect. Heather reduced the most under intensive grazing (from 71% to 6% cover on average). A 59 ha area of hill pasture was subjected to four levels of grazing intensity: ungrazed, lightly grazed, normally grazed and intensively grazed. Grazing took place two to four times a year, in late spring and late summer. There were three fields: one abandoned in 1910 (64 years before), one in 1960 (14 years before) and one grazed every year since 1910.

There were short, heavily grazed patches interspersed with taller, lightly grazed patches, a micro-pattern that tended to be stable after initial establishment. Heavily and lightly sheep grazed areas differed little in plant species composition, but abundances of species differed considerably. Heavily grazed areas were characterized by equal amounts of monocots (mainly grasses) and broadleaved species, had higher abundances of rosette species and, to a lesser extent, greater persistence of perennial rye grass <em>Lolium perenne</em>. Lightly grazed patches were dominated by common bent grass <em>Agrostis tenuis</em> and had a large amount of plant litter. Prior to 1972, the grassland was cut for hay and aftermath grazed by cattle. Sheep grazed part of the grassland (3 sheep/ha) from 1972 in July-December and January-July. After 1980, the area was left ungrazed for 2 months each winter. Vegetation was recorded annually within permanent 2 x 2 m quadrats. Grazing intensity was recorded in February as lightly grazed (&gt;70% litter cover), heavily grazed (&lt;30% litter cover), or intermediate. Species abundance was quantified on a dry weight basis. Vegetation was also mapped from October 1979-1982 in a 10 x 10 m² area and recorded as heavily grazed (&lt;5 cm tall) and lightly grazed (&gt;10 cm tall).</p><p> </p>",

Fertilizer addition almost completely exhausted the soil phosphorus store in long-term wheat experiments. Three studies investigating nutrient removal by stubble burning were reviewed (Allen 1964, Kenworthy 1964, Chapman 1967).

However, this was only evident at intermediate to large sampling scales, suggesting that differences arose from changes in rarer and widely dispersed species. Many annual herbs decreased in ungrazed paddocks in 1985, whilst some annual grasses and other perennial herbs and grasses increased. In grazed (spring or autumn) paddocks, many more species increased their distribution compared to ungrazed plots, particularly annual herbs. The field (12 ha) had been permanent pasture until 1960 and was then cultivated until 1981. In 1985, the central 90 x 90 m blocks of two 1 ha blocks were divided into nine paddocks, i.e. three replicates of three treatments.

Within 18 months, 57% of plant species restricted to patches of old chalk/limestone (calcareous) grassland within 2 km had colonized the study field. Colonization was not thought to have come via the seed bank. In addition, the area grazed April-November contained many component species of mature chalk/limestone (calcicolous) grassland, unlike ungrazed controls. The 12 ha field had been permanent pasture until 1960 and was then cultivated until 1981. In 1985, two blocks of 1 ha were divided into nine paddocks, three replicates of spring grazed, autumn grazed and ungrazed treatments.

The controlled trial found that introducing mowing to an abandoned grassland increased the number of plant species after ten years, but the response was slow. The replicated controlled trial found that when 12 native grassland species were sown, fewer seedlings emerged in burned plots (average 5.6 seedlings/species/plot after one year) than in plots mown with litter removal before sowing (average 8 seedlings/species/plot). Plots mown without litter removal were intermediate (6.1 seedlings/species/plot). Mown grassland plots were still dominated by tor grass <em>Brachypodium pinnatum </em>at the end of the experiment. Mown plots increased from a total of 46 plant species in 1989 to 68 species in total by 1996-1997. The total frequencies of all species other than tor grass stayed low for six years, and increased strongly in the final four years of the experiment. The replicated controlled study also found common rockrose <em>Helianthemum nummularium</em> had the lowest seedling emergence (0-0.8 seedlings/plot after one year) and rough hawkbit <em>Leontodon hispidus</em> had the highest (17-24 seedlings/plot after one year). After two years, ten of the sown species survived, with the grasses having the highest survival rates (27-36% of seeds germinated). No bulbous buttercup <em>Ranunculus bulbosus </em>or meadow clary <em>Salvia pratensis</em> seedlings survived. In the controlled study, mowing was resumed in the abandoned grassland in two 100 m<sup>2</sup> plots. From 1988, one plot was mown twice a year (July and September-October), one was mown in early July only. A control plot was not mown. Plant species composition was monitored in September-October at 456 point quadrat samples/plot over ten years, from 1988 to 1997. In July 1989 and 1995, percentage cover across each whole plot was estimated for plant species. In the replicated controlled study, forty-five seeds of each species, hand-collected from a nearby meadow were sown into twenty-four 60 x 60 cm subplots in October 1995. Each plot was subject to one of three treatments before sowing (six replicates of each): mowing with removal of mown vegetation, burning or mowing with complete removal of litter. For each treatment, a control 60 x 60 cm plot was treated the same but not sown. Seedling emergence was recorded every one to five months for the following two years.

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A 2004 review of published and unpublished literature from the UK (Walker<em> et al.</em> 2004) found that introducing plant species and removing nutrients are important to effective grassland restoration. The review identified eight studies that tested effects of reinstating cutting and grazing management on grassland, and ceasing fertilizer use and concluded that this could enhance the number of plant species, but it was slow and did not always work. Just one study, in west Wales, found a marked increase in the number of plant species over eight years (Hayes &amp; Sackville Hamilton 2001). Five found a slight or gradual increase, over 4-14 years ((Bullock<em> et al.</em> 1994), Oomes 1990, Olff &amp; Bakker 1991, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2000, (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2000)). Two studies found no change or a decrease (Oomes 1990, Mountford <em>et al</em>. 1994). Increases in the number of species were modest and slow. Cutting and grazing together were generally more effective than cutting or grazing alone. On existing grassland, the review found nine studies that tested various methods of adding plant species: adding seed (over-sowing), drilling seed (slot-seeding) and planting small plants (plug-planting), with effects monitored over two to eight years. Three studies found that over-sowing was most effective when combined with either cutting and grazing or de-turfing (Hopkins<em> et al.</em> 1999, Jones &amp; Hayes 1999, Smith<em> et al.</em> 2000). Five studies found that slot-seeding was not very effective (Wells <em>et al</em>. 1989, (Hopkins<em> et al.</em> 1999, Coulson<em> et al.</em> 2001)). Of five studies that tested plug-planting, three found it was initially effective, but survival of the introduced plants fell after two to five years (Wells <em>et al</em>. 1989, (Hopkins<em> et al.</em> 1999), Barratt <em>et al</em>. 2000). Two found 60-70% of plants established (over two or five years) (Boyce 1995, (Hopkins<em> et al.</em> 1999)). On ex-arable land, ten studies tested sowing grassland species, monitoring effects for between one and 20 years. All found increased plant species diversity and enhanced similarity to the target plant community, which was either upland, chalk or neutral (mesotrophic) grassland. Similarity to the target community was quantified for six of these studies and fell between 50% and 81%, usually after two to five years (20 years in one case) (McDonald 1992, Wells <em>et al</em>. 1994, (Stevenson<em> et al.</em> 1995), Pywell <em>et al</em>. 2000, (Pywell<em> et al.</em> 2002)). Cultivation, followed by a relatively high seeding rate, seemed the most effective approach. On upland grassland, adding sulphur to acidify the soil prior to seeding led to effective establishment of sown species in two studies.</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Wells T.C.E., Cox R. &amp; Frost A.

Hay spreading was thought more effective because it captured seeds from a greater range of heights in the sward, and allowed for seeds to mature on the restored site after the restoration activity. Eight different combinations of harrowing and the two methods of applying seed were tested, on land that had been improved agricultural grassland, with two different rates of hay application. There were four replicates of each combination of treatments.

Devil’s-bit scabious <em>Succisa </em><em>pratensis</em> plugs established in all plots after two growing seasons and seeds in 45% plots. Spotted cat\\'s-ear <em>Hypochoeris</em> <em>maculata</em> plugs established in 81% of plots and seeds in 33%. Germination rate of seeds varied between donor sites, particularly for devil’s-bit scabious (0-11% germination rate), spotted cat\\'s-ear varied only slightly (7-10%). Litter removal did not affect devil’s-bit scabious germination or survival, for spotted cat\\'s-ear the effect of raking on survival depended on donor site. The four donor sites were species-rich, traditionally managed meadows. At the three recipient sites, eight 72 x 72 cm plots were established, each divided into sixteen 18 x 18 cm sub-plots. For each species, six sub-plots had seeds (50 seeds/subplot) and four-month-old plugs (two plugs/subplot) introduced. Four control sub-plots had no seed or plugs. Seeds were sown in October 2003 and plugs planted in May 2004. Litter was removed from half of each plot (randomly selected). Emerging seedlings were recorded in May 2004, survival in October 2005 and plug survival in October 2005.</p><p> </p>",

Total species richness, richness of forest species and of open-habitat species did not differ between restored and traditional sites. There were 1-12 ant species per site (average eight species, two forest species, three open habitat species). Total species richness increased with time since restoration (up to 12 years), largely due to increasing open habitat species richness. However, the proportion of rare species was higher at younger restored sites. Vegetation height, size of study site and numbers of trees and shrubs did not affect species richness. Sites were restored from 1994 to 2001, trees and shrubs were removed and regular grazing resumed. Ants were sampled along a transect of 15 pitfall traps (10 m apart) at each site over seven days in June 2006. Vegetation height was measured around randomly selected traps.</p><p> </p>",

The review found 38 studies, 28 of which provided enough information to evaluate the outcome, 21 of these from European countries (of which some also looked at the effects on wet meadows). Studies were graded as: successful, of limited success, failed introductions, or without the necessary information to evaluate the outcome. Direct seeding had success or limited success in 10 European studies. Hay spreading had success or limited success in seven European studies (four of which on wet meadows) and was not shown to fail ((Smith<em> et al.</em> 2000), Patzelt <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hölzel &amp; Otte 2003, (Kiehl &amp; Pfadenhauer 2007), Rasran <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schmiede <em>et al</em>. 2009, Klimkowska <em>et al</em>. 2010). Plug planting had success/limited success in two European studies (one on wet grassland) ((Fenner &amp; Spellerberg 1988), Tallowin &amp; Smith 2001). Strip seeding did not reintroduce species in two studies (both recorded in (Pywell<em> et al.</em> 2007)).</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Patzelt A., Wild U. &amp; Pfadenhauer J.

Between six and eight bee (Apidae), butterfly (Lepidoptera) or hoverfly (Syrphidae) species were recorded/plot, compared to around two species on plots sown with grasses. The abundance of pollinators was strongly related to the cover of legumes and other non-grass plants. The cover of sown grasses and non-leguminous broadleaved plants was higher when sown following deep cultivation and herbicide treatment than after shallow cultivation alone. The cover with sown non-grass species (legumes and other broadleaved plants) was significantly higher in plots that were cut twice or three times for silage than in grazed treatments. There were four replicates of each treatment combination, on plots either 16 x 32 m (those cut for silage) or 25 x 50 m (grazed plots).</p><p> </p>",
