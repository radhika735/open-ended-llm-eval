        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Humans have introduced mammalian predators to hundreds of islands across the world, most frequently rats Rattus spp., mice Mus spp. and cats <em>Felis cattus</em>, but many others as well. These have had a devastating impact on bird populations on islands, with the historic probability of extinction on islands being well correlated with the number of introduced mammal species (Blackburn <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Most control efforts for rodents are through poisoning (with a 2007 review suggesting that bait stations are more effective than broadcast baiting, Howald <em>et al</em>. 2007), whilst trapping and hunting appear to be more effective for cats (Nogales <em>et al.</em> 2004) and larger mammals. However, this synopsis only discusses the impacts of eradication or control on native bird populations, not the details of eradication programmes themselves. The effects of different control methods will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming Conservation Evidence synopsis on invasive species.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Below are two studies describing the impacts of island predator removal on bird communities.
