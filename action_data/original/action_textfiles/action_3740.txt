        "background_definitions": "<p>Reptiles that are injured, sick or found in a weak condition are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be treated and released back into the wild. Animals may be injured or weakened due to direct interactions with human threats, for example entanglement in fishing gear, or due to natural threats such as extremes of weather caused by climate change (for example sea turtles may become ‘cold-shocked’ due to sudden severe cold weather). Often rehabilitation is carried out more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation. However, for rare species it may be essential to preserve populations and release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared reptiles. It is also important to note that some of the studies summarized below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are less likely to have been reported.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Six rehabilitated turtles were tracked for an average of 156 days following release, and half were followed for longer than wild turtles. Rehabilitated turtles showed similar behaviour to wild turtles in 46 of 54 comparisons, with four of six rehabilitated turtles showing 1–3 behavioural differences each (see paper for details). Six injured turtles were brought to a rescue centre in 2004, 2006 and 2007 due to injuries sustained from boat strikes (2 turtles, 330–332 days in captivity), deeply embedded fishing hooks (2 turtles, 137–150 days in captivity), and injured flippers from net entanglement (2 turtles, 41 days in captivity). They were released between November 2004–March 2007. Twelve wild turtles were captured by a diver in 2003–2004 while basking. All turtles had a satellite tag attached and location data was received and processed by the Argos satellite system</p>",

In total, 626 (37%) sea turtles survived rehabilitation and were released back into the wild, 1,047 (62%) died in rehabilitation and 27 (2%) survived but were kept in captivity. More time spent in rehabilitation increased the likelihood of turtles surviving and being released (data presented as statistical model outputs). Most deaths occurred within a few weeks of rehabilitation and successful rehabilitation took from several months to &gt;3 years. Loggerhead turtles <em>Caretta caretta </em>were most likely to survive rehabilitation, followed by kemp’s ridley turtles <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, and green turtles <em>Chelonia mydas </em>had the lowest chance of survival (data presented as statistical model outputs). In 1986–2004, a total of 2,462 live-stranded sea turtles were taken into rehabilitation, of which 1,700 individuals had known outcomes and statistical modelling could be carried out using data from 392 individuals. Rehabilitated species included green, loggerhead, kemp’s ridley, hawksbill <em>Eretmochelys imbricata</em>, leatherback <em>Dermochelys coriacea </em>and olive ridley <em>Lepidochelys</em> <em>olivacea </em>sea turtles.

In total, 96% of rescued sea turtles were rehabilitated and released (744 of 775 individuals). However, in the third and fourth years after the release programme began, 161 turtles were recaptured incidentally in a recreational fishery. Twenty-nine turtles were recaptured three times and two turtles were recaptured six times. Time between original release and recapture ranged from 12–1,121 days and 71% of recaptures occurred within the vicinity of the release location. In total, 775 rescued live sea turtles were brought to a rehabilitation facility in 2010–2014. The majority were incidentally caught in a recreational hook and line fishery (732 individuals) and the remainder were either caught in trawl or dredge equipment or suffering from boat strikes or live strandings. Rehabilitated turtles were released after medical clearance. Turtles were individually marked, which allowed recaptures to be monitored opportunistically as they occurred. Sea turtles caught were kemp’s ridley <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em> (98%), loggerhead <em>Caretta caretta </em>(1%) or green sea turtles <em>Chelonia mydas </em>(1%).</p>",
