Predation rate of nesting females was also significantly lower at sites with predator control (5% of 38 tracked females vs. 65% of 17). Stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>, common brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus</em><em> </em><em>vulpecula</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. were controlled with trapping and poisoning with 1080 sodium monofluoroacetate and anticoagulents. Data comes from 1996-2000 for five sites and 1984-1996 for one (unmanaged) site.</p><p> </p>",
