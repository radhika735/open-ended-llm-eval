        "background_definitions": "<p>Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See <a href=\"../../data/index?terms=Breed%20reptiles%20in%20captivity&amp;yt0=\">here for other species groups</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see <a href=\"../../actions/3772\"><em>Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild</em></a>.</p>",

In 1979, a female produced a clutch of 17 eggs, six of which hatched successfully after 115–118 days of incubation. One hatchling died after two weeks, and the other five survived at least three months. In 1975, a clutch was laid but the eggs rolled into the water and were broken. In 1966–1967, a juvenile pair of caimans were acquired and housed together in a circular pool with a concrete island along with several other crocodilians. After the clutch was lost in 1975, the pair were moved to a new enclosure with dense vegetation and a pool of water. Water temperatures ranged from 21–27°C and air temperatures were 21°C in winter and followed ambient temperatures in summer. Eggs were moved to a Styrofoam container, covered with peat moss and incubated at 29–31°C and 92–100% humidity. After 112 days of incubation, eggs were uncovered, moved gently and a grunting call was made to simulate actions by an adult.</p>",
