Gaps are prepared prior to sowing by breaking up the grass sward and disturbing the soil, e.g. by digging. The aim is to reduce competition by resident grasses and provide optimal conditions for the establishment of sown target grassland species. This may be particularly beneficial within dense species-poor grasslands.</p>",

During the first two years after sowing, the average cover of target plant species was higher when seeds were sown in large gaps (4 x 4 m: 52–59%) than in smaller gaps (1 x 1 m: 27–31%; 2 x 2 m: 16–39%). The cover of weed species did not differ significantly between the three gap sizes (1 x 1 m: 19–26%; 2 x 2 m: 16–29%; 4 x 4 m: 19%). In October 2013, gaps of three sizes (1 x 1 m, 2 x 2 m, 4 x 4 m) were created &gt;50 m apart within existing grassland at each of eight sites. All sites were former arable fields sown with a low diversity grass seed mix in October 2005. Gaps were prepared by digging, rotary hoeing and raking the soil. All gaps were sown with a seed mixture of 35 native grassland species at a rate of 10 g/m<sup>2</sup> and grazed by cattle in April–October each year. Vegetation cover was recorded in each of the 24 gaps in June 2014 and 2015.</p><p> </p>",
