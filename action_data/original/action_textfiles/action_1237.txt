The main reasons are that they may provide good wood fuel that increases the intensity of future wildfires. Removing the burned trees is often done by heavy machinery which compresses the soil and may affect the germination and regrowth of plants. Removing the dead organic matter may affect soil mineral content and plant composition. Removing burned trees may also influence the spatial pattern of germination and seedling establishment and change the forest structure and composition.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
