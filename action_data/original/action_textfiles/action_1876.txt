Two egg clutches were found, one in a section of bamboo stem filled with damp soil substrate, and another under a moist rotting log on a mix of soil and leaf litter. A total of 39 froglets were raised after one year. A captive breeding program had been running for this species since 2004, but only one froglet was reared after three years of trying. From 2006-2007, five male and five female frogs were placed in a purpose built outdoor enclosure. Further detials in: Narayan E, Christi K. &amp; Morley C.

Neither species bred successfully in captivity before 2011. Once animals were moved to breeding arenas with a more complex habitat in August 2011, <em>S. parvis</em> tadpoles were observed from October 2011 and <em>S. guttatus</em> tadpoles from March 2012. By 2012, a total of 285 <em>S. parvis</em> froglets, 600 tadpoles and 180 juveniles had been raised and 76 <em>S. guttatus</em> tadpoles had been raised. In August 2011, five pairs of each species were moved from a medium-sized (50 × 60 × 70 cm) terraria with tree branches, plants and stones and no simulated wet and dry seasons, to larger (150 × 120 × 100 cm) enclosures with controllable waterfalls, plants, small burrows, ledges for calling sites and perching sites, and simulated wet and dry seasons. The waterfall for <em>S. guttatus</em> also had several tree branches.</p>",
