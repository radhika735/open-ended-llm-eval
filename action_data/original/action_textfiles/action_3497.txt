The authors reported that older-style restored areas (established using trees only) were unsuitable for most reptile species, whereas more advanced restoration approaches (including direct topsoil return) supported more species and greater abundance of reptiles. Some reptile abundances were lower in restored forest compared to unmined areas (see original paper for details). In 1976, two sites were restored by seeding (1 site) or top soil addition (1 site). In 1990, further sites (number not given) were restored using various techniques, including topsoil return, deep ripping, understorey seeding of many local species and establishment of local eucalypt species.

Six of six Napoleon’s skinks translocated to restored mine sites moved into unmined forest within 7 days. In the first 30 days, skinks released into restored mine sites travelled greater daily distances (4.0 m/day) compared to skinks released into unmined forest (1.9 m/day). All 12 skinks (6 released in restored mining sites; 6 released in unmined sites) had settled in unmined forest after four months, but skinks released into restored mine sites still travelled more each day (3.0 m/day) than skinks originally released into unmined forest (0.4 m/day). In November 2008, twelve Napoleon’s skinks were released in three five-year-old restored forest sites and three unmined forest sites (two skinks/site; see original paper for details of restoration). Skinks were radio-tracked weekly for the first four weeks after release and then monthly for the next three months. Skinks were recaptured and weighed monthly.</p>",

Up to 17 years after eucalypt forest restoration in two mine pits, reptile communities were different in restored forest compared to unmined forest (data reported as statistical model outputs, see original paper for details). Of the most commonly caught species, five species were observed in both restored and unmined forest, of which three species were less abundant in restored than unmined forest, and two species were less abundant in 8–17-year-old restored forest compared to four-year-old restored forest or unmined forest (see paper for details on individual species abundances). Reptiles were monitored in two restored mine pits in areas with four, eight, 12 and 17-year-old restoration forest plantings and unmined forest (six plots/forest type, split between the two mine pits).

The effects of restoration and the provision of egg laying sites cannot be separated. Nine months after artificial egg-laying sites were installed, four of 34 sites were used by geckos and 10 eggs had been laid. Two years after the first artificial egg-laying sites were installed, eight of 40 sites were used by geckos and 41 eggs had been laid. Native plants (22,000 plants of 50 species) were planted in an area (9,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of degraded habitat in a hydroelectric power plant to restore habitat. In September 2009–July 2010, forty artificial egg-laying sites were added to one area (34 were installed by June 2010 and a further six by July 2010). Artificial egg-laying sites comprised hollow, rectangular metal poles (4 x 8 x 250 cm) inserted into the ground (50 cm deep).

Following reseeding and restoration of a former open cast coal mine, four turtle species (10–198 individuals/species) and seven snake species (1–16 individuals/species) colonised two ephemeral ponds within 30 years. Between 1976 and 1982, the study site (729 ha) was a 30 m deep, open pit strip mine. Following mine closure, in 1982 the area was contoured and seeded to herbaceous cover vegetation initially and then in 1988 re-seeded to prairie grass species. As a result of mining activities, the area contained several waterbodies, including two ephemeral pond and wetland areas (0.14–0.33 ha).

Seven years after burning and tree thinning (management) took place, reptile species richness was similar between managed-restored forest (5 species/plot) and unmanaged-restored forest (4 species/plot) but richness in both restored forest types was lower than in unmined forest (9 species/plot).
