Inactivity was reduced from 35% of time when predictable feeding times were maintained to 27% of time when predictable feeding times were given. Abnormal behaviours did not change significantly from when feeding times were predictable (1%) to when they were unpredictable (0.2%). Two groups of chimpanzees were fed on a predictable schedule and two groups were fed on a more unpredictable schedule. A total of 30 chimpanzees were observed within the four groups. Four meals of fresh produce were given daily and observational data were collected at two times each day, during the pre-feeding period and feeding schedules were unchanged, between 09:30 h and 10:00 h for 30 minutes for a total of 100 hours.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
