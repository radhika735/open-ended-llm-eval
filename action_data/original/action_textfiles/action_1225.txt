There was no effect of herbicide on the number of trees (herbicide: 4,180; control: 7,648/ha) or number of plants species (herbicide: 24; control: 23/treatment unit). Data were collected in 1998 in herbicide (using glyphosate herbicide to retain 1,000 stems/ha) and control treatment units (2-13 ha). Units were established in 1993 in each of three study areas.</p><p> </p>",
