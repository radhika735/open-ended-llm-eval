Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity is a huge threat worldwide and those engaging in criminal activity on a large scale may gain substantially financially. Heavy fines or penalties may act as a deterrent to prevent illegal fishing or non-compliance and help protect fish populations from the effects of overfishing.</p>",
