Adding coarse woody debris (20 tonne/ha clumped or 40 tonne/ha clumped and dispersed) increased overall reptile abundance in one site and overall reptile abundance and small skink abundance in another site compared to not adding debris (results reported as model outputs). The effect of adding coarse woody debris was greatest in open vegetation compared to mid- or high-density vegetation, particularly when vegetation was subject to high-intensity grazing by kangaroos <em>Macropus giganteus</em> (see paper for details). Reptiles were monitored in 96 plots (1 ha) in 24 sites across two nature reserves (4 plots/site). In October 2007, coarse woody debris was added to 1 ha plots as follows: 20 tonnes/ha evenly dispersed (24 plots), 20 tonnes/ha in clumps (24), 40 tonnes/ha clumped and dispersed (24), or no coarse woody debris (24). In December 2007, six sites were fenced to exclude kangaroos and grazing levels were classed as low (fenced: 0.4 kangaroos/ha) or high (unfenced: 2.1).
