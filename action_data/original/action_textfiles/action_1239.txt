The total cover of grasses and herbaceous species was lower in plots with mulch mats (39-33%) than in control plots (71-68%) in the first three years, but similar 5-7 years after treatment (mulch: 70-90%; control: 80%). Herbaceous species and grasses were monitored in four 12 × 12 m plots of each treatment: control and covered with 90 × 90 cm plastic mulch mats.
