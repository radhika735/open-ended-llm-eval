        "key_message": "<p>We have captured 30 replicated trials of nest boxes for solitary bees in 10 countries, including Europe, North and South America and Asia. Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus <em>Centris</em> in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.</p>\r\n<p>A set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.</p>\r\n<p>Two replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee <em>Centris analis</em> in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.</p>\r\n<p>Three trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of <em>Osmia</em> in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.</p>\r\n<p>One small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging <em>Osmia</em> bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.</p>\r\n<p>Eleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee <em>Xylocopa fenestrata</em> in India.</p>\r\n<p>Two replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.</p>\r\n<p>A small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee <em>Andrena flavipes</em> in the UK, but they were not occupied.</p>",
