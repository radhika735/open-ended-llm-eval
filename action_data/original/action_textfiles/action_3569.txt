Three main steps may be undertaken in the treatment of sewage and wastewater: primary treatment, where solid material that either floats or sinks is removed; secondary treatment, where soluble organic matter that escapes primary treatment is removed by microbial activity; and tertiary treatment, which provides a final stage to increase water quality before it is discharged into the environment. Improving the treatment standards for agricultural, residential and commercial waste may reduce the threat posed by wastewater to reptile populations.</p>",
