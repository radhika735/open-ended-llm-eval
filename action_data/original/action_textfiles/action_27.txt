They found no difference in the abundances of squash bees <em>Peponapis pruinosa</em>, bumblebees <em>Bombus</em> sp. or honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em> that could be explained by pesticide use. The study included no information about the type of pesticide, quantity or timing of its use. The authors assumed pesticides were applied on these study farms at times when bees were not exposed.</p>",
