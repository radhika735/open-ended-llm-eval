Between 1989-94, 93 juvenile kites (48 males, 45 females) were released in southern England and had an average first-year survival rate of 76%, increasing to 91-2% in second and third years and 100% for fourth and five years after release. There was a slight difference between male and female survival, leading to a gradual change in the sex ratio. During 1989-93, 93 juvenile kites (all from Sweden) were released in northern Scotland and had an average first-year survival rate of 52%, increasing to 67-88% in second and third years and 75-91% for fourth and five years after release. <strong> </strong>Early breeding attempts in England are described in (3) and by 1995 there were 24 breeding pairs fledging at least 115 young during 1991-5. In Scotland, breeding was first attempted (successfully) in 1992, with 15 breeding pairs in 1995. During 1992-5, 29 clutches were laid, fledging 47 chicks. Survival rates of wild-raised birds in both regions did not differ significantly from released birds during 1992-4. Main causes of mortality were poisoning and collisions in Scotland, with poisoning also being important in England.</p><p> </p>",

Productivity in 2003 was comparable to other parts of their range (1.8-2.0 young/breeding pair) for all populations except the smallest (0.25 young/breeding pair). High mortality rates in the less successful sites are thought to be due to illegal poisoning. Birds were taken from large populations across Europe when 4-6 weeks old, kept in aviaries for a further eight weeks (with minimal human contact) and then released.

Survival rates of released birds were significantly lower than those of wild-bred birds, particularly during the first three years of life (74% survival for one year-old released birds vs. 82% for wild-bred; 94% survival for released birds aged four or more vs. 97% for wild-bred birds; overall probability of surviving until five years old of 37% for released birds vs. 53% for wild-bred). Breeding success of the established population is similar to that of the Norwegian population (in similar environmental conditions) but lower than populations elsewhere in Europe. Overall, breeding success and productivity have increased with time, as reintroduced birds get older (which significantly increases the probability of fledging young) and a higher proportion of the population consists of wild-bred birds (0.61 young fledged/territorial pair in 1993-2000 vs. 0.76 young fledged/territorial pair in 2003-7).</p><p> </p>",
