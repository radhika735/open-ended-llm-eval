For 11 ecosystems, the ecological status, defined by indicators for sustainable stocks, non-declining exploited species and ecosystem status (health), was greater in ecosystems where management and governance measures for fish stocks were ranked as being high, for example where long-term management plans were in place, in addition to biological reference points being used in assessments, illegal and unreported fishing addressed, and with greater harvesting sector participation, compared with those with lower rankings (data reported as model outputs/statistical results). Data were collected for a total of 27 global ecosystems as part of a large research programme (“IndiSeas” – Indicators for the Seas). Fisheries management effectiveness and governance quality rankings were derived from survey questionnaires completed by 61 experts (fisheries managers and scientists involved in management advice in each of the ecosystems), covering aspects such as management measures/plans, level of fisheries assessments and participation of the harvesting sector. Survey results were then analysed against eight ecological (derived from other IndiSeas outputs) and socio-economic indicators for 11 of the ecosystems, derived (see paper for details of ecosystems, management effectiveness and governance indicators, survey questions, data sources and full methods).</p>",
