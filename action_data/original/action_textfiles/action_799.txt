        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">High densities of wildfowl can strip aquatic vegetation from ponds and their banks, reducing shelter habitat and egg-laying sites for amphibians. Water quality may also be reduced through defecation and continual stirring up of sediments. Wildfowl can also prey on adult amphibians and their eggs. They are also potential environmental reservoirs for <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> the cause of chytridiomycosis. A study in Belgium found that 15% of wild geese tested in were positive for the fungus (Garmyn <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Garmyn A., Van Rooij P., Pasmans F., Hellebuyck T., Van Den Broeck W., Haesebrouck F. &amp; Martel A.
