The abundance of butterflies on farms with more semi-natural habitat was higher than on farms with less semi-natural habitat, but there was no difference in butterfly species richness (data presented as model results). A total of 133 farms (17–34 ha, 13–91% arable crops) were managed with “Ecological Compensation Areas” under agri-environment schemes. Management included extensive and low-input meadows with reduced fertilizer and later cutting dates, and the presence of trees, hedgerows and wildflower patches. From May–September 2009–2011, butterflies were surveyed six times on 10–38 transects/farm, totalling 2,500 m/farm. Each transect ran diagonally through a single crop or habitat type, with all available crops and habitats represented. All visits to a farm were completed in a single year, and the species richness was summed across all visits. Total abundance of butterflies was calculated from the number recorded in each habitat, and the availability of each habitat across the farm. Semi-natural habitats on each farm were mapped between May and August.</p>",

The number of species of butterfly recorded on field margins was higher on farms with more semi-natural habitat within 1 km than on farms surrounded by less semi-natural habitat (data presented as model results). The amount of semi-natural habitat within 1 km of each of seven farms (58–700 ha) was estimated from aerial images.

Agricultural areas with more than 20% of the land managed as semi-natural habitat had a higher abundance and species richness of all butterflies than areas with less than 10% semi-natural habitat. The abundance of farmland butterflies, and the species richness of threatened butterflies, was higher in landscapes with more semi-natural habitat than in landscapes with less semi-natural habitat (all data presented as model results). Fifty mixed farming areas (1 km<sup>2</sup>) were selected where 2.5–32.2% of agricultural land was managed under agri-environment schemes (primarily extensive meadows (cut or grazed once/year, no fertilizers or pesticides) and orchards). Butterflies were surveyed seven times along a 2.5-km transect through each 1-km<sup>2 </sup>area in one of five years (2010–2014).
