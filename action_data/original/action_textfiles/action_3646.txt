        "background_definitions": "<p>Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone, and others have been shaped by long-term use of prescribed burning (Bowman 1998). Prescribed burns are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging, ‘wildfires’. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires that have been suppressed through management or with the expressed purpose of enhancing wildlife habitat (Russell <em>et al</em>. 1999). Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, the intensity of the fire may influence the response of reptiles to the prescribed burn–low-intensity fires may reduce shelters and prey availability while high-intensity fires may increase prey food items but reduce over wintering sites (Pearson <em>et al.</em> 2005). The impact of prescribed burning on habitats and their associated reptile populations are likely to vary depending on whether the vegetation is dominated by woody species, or by grasses and other herbaceous plants. As such, the impact of prescribed burning on reptile populations may vary in different habitats.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type.

The one-year cycle was most consistent for supporting high numbers of individuals and species. The six-lined race runner <em>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</em> was the most abundant lizard and densities were greatest on one-year burn cycles (see paper for details). One ha plots were established for one-, two-, and seven-year burn cycles in adjacent strips with burns taking place from 1976. These were compared to a plot unburned for 20 years (last burn in 1965). Burns were in May–June. Five drift-fence arrays with pitfall traps and an artificial cover board were established/plot. Traps were checked 5–6 times/week in April–October 1983–1984.</p>",
