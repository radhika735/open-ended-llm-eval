Six years after an alternate-year burning combined with season-long stocking regime began, species richness was estimated to be similar (32 species) compared to five years after the start of annual burning combined with intensive early cattle stocking (27 species). Four turtle species, six lizard species and 17 snake species were observed during the study. The authors reported that species loss rates were estimated to be higher following burn years (see paper for details). In 1989–1998, season-long stocking (200 cows with calves, 0.6 animals/ha) was combined with alternate year prescribed burning. On the same site in 1999–2003, intensive-early cattle stocking (650 yearling cattle, 1 animal/ha for 3 months starting in late spring) was combined with annual prescribed burning. In 1989–2003, visual surveys for reptiles were conducted on one day in mid-spring each year along a 4 km transect by turning over rocks and other debris and sighting animals in the open.</p>",

Overall reptile abundance was similar in burned (12–20 individuals/plot) and unburned plots (14–19), regardless of grazing practices. Of 18 species recorded, one dragon species abundance was higher in burned than unburned plots regardless of grazing (central netted dragon <em>Ctenophorus nuchalis</em> burned: 0.7–1.0 individuals/plot; unburned: 0–0.1) and one ctenotus abundance was lower in burned than unburned plots, particularly when burning was combined with grazing (leopard ctenotus <em>Ctenotus pantherinus</em> burned: 0–1.4; unburned: 1.3–4.4). In January 2001, reptiles were monitored on three cattle stations (&gt;20,000 ha each) in 29 one-ha plots that were either grazed (4–8 cattle/ha) or ungrazed (paddocks where cattle were excluded) and either recently burned (within 2 years) or unburned (last burnt &gt;2 years ago). Burns were a mixture of prescribed burns and wildfires and all treatments took place over &gt;2,000 ha areas. Reptiles were sampled using cage traps and pitfalls supplemented by day and night log rolling and litter raking.</p>",

The four historical treatments (≥ 400 ha) were: annual prescribed burning (August–September) with or without grazing (3 ha/cattle unit), three years since a prescribed burning, and no fire or grazing for 12 years.

Para-grass dominated habitat in a conservation park (3,245 ha) was divided into 12 plots (200 x 300 m each) and each plot was either burned, grazed, burned and grazed, or not managed (3 plots/management type).
