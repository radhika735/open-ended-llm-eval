        "background_definitions": "<p>Greenspaces and road verges offer potential habitat patches and corridors for butterflies and moths. However, management of these spaces must be carefully planned. Mowing may be required to keep vegetation down, but also reduces the availability of nectar resources, inhibits the growth of host plants used by caterpillars, reduces the structural diversity of the vegetation, and poses a risk from direct mortality, especially to eggs, caterpillars and pupae (Hopwood <em>et al.</em> 2015). Road verges with a higher species richness of plants attract more butterflies, and yet have fewer butterflies killed by traffic than less diverse road verges (Skórka <em>et al.</em> 2013). Therefore, altering mowing regimes to encourage plant growth and diversity may benefit butterfly and moth populations in urban areas.</p>\r\n<p>See also: “<em>Transportation and service corridors – <a href=\"../../actions/3854\">Restore or maintain species-rich grassland along road/railway verges</a></em>” and “<em>Pollution – <a href=\"../../actions/3899\">Stop using herbicides on pavements and road verges</a></em>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Hopwood J., Black S.H., Lee-Mäder E., Charlap A., Preston R., Mozumder K. &amp; Fleury S.

On 30 days between June and August 2003, butterflies were sampled using mark-release-recapture surveys along a 2.2-km long transect along a highway intersection and adjacent roads. The site was divided into 80–280-m sections based on habitat: an intersection between two roads with either late summer mowing and hay removal or with mid-summer (June) mowing without hay removal, and a highway verge with either partial July and full late summer mowing without hay removal (counted as late summer mowing in the study) or with mid-summer (July) mowing without hay removal.
