When housed separately and fed at a random time and place of the enclosure, time spent stereotypic pacing by the female tiger (1%) was reduced compared to a conventional feeding schedule (16%) but not by the male (random placement: 0%; conventional feeding: 3%). When housed as a pair, stereotypic pacing was reduced in both tigers (0%) compared to conventional feeding (female: 7%; male: 10%). Two tigers were studied both when housed alone and as a pair. Several electronically controlled feeding boxes were installed at different places within the outdoor areas of the enclosure. Before 09:00 h, meat was distributed to all boxes and the doors were closed. The tigers were only able to open the boxes during two random 15 minute periods between 09:00 h and 17:30 h when the doors were unlocked. Tigers were fed on three day feeding regimes including a three-day baseline (fed at 14:30 h for two days and one fast day), three days conventional feeding (fed at 14:30 h) and lastly box feeding. Behaviour was recorded for six hours on the third day of each regime using focal sampling. The study was replicated when housed as a pair.</p>",

Activity was defined as all behaviours except resting and sleeping. Four adult foxes, housed together, were fed daily except Saturdays, on 400 g of meat, 200 g of fruits and 200 g of dried dog food, raisins, sunflower seeds and nuts. Behaviour was observed for one-hour sessions four times a day. During each observation hour, each fox was continuously observed for 15 minutes to assess behavioural diversity while instantaneous scan sampling at 2.5 minute intervals was used to assess general activity. Data were collected for five days in six conditions: 1) scheduled feeding times; 2) electronic feeders, each randomly dispensing 1/3 of all meat feed between 10:00 h and 18:00 h; 3) electronic feeders and a self-service food box; 4) electronic feeders plus scattered and hidden food; 5) electronic feeders and an electronic dispenser which dispersed food around the enclosure; and 6) a second period of scheduled feeding times</p>",

Factors that did not have a significant effect included visual barriers, presence of raised areas, visitor numbers, sex, vehicle disturbance, presence of enrichment, age and diet diversity. One hundred and twelve cheetahs in 88 enclosures, maintained in nine zoological institutions were studied.
