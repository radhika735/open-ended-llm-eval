Both orchards were fertilized (30 t compost/ha), but the orchard with cover crops got more fertilizer (1,500 kg organic fertilizer/ha on one-third of each plot, 250 kg mineral fertilizer/ha on one-third). The orchard with cover crops had cereal-fallow rotations before the cover crops, and it was tilled in November. Soil samples were collected on 18 July 2006 (0–20 cm depth). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of cover crops, tillage, fertilizer, or site.</p><p> </p>",
