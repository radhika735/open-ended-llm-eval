This can be detrimental both through direct collision mortality, but also because seabirds especially can be vulnerable to predators or dehydration if they are downed by collisions, even if they are not hurt.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Dangerous lights can be designed specifically to be seen, for example on communications towers or lighthouses, or can simply be lights used at night, for example, domestic lighting.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
