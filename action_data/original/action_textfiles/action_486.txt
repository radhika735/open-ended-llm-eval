Platforms at inland sites were used less than those at coastal sites. Pied avocets <em>Recurvirostra avosetta</em> only bred on sparsely-covered islands and platforms at southern, coastal sites, with the provision of shingle islands leading to a significant increase in the avocet population at one site and the establishment of a population at another. Common ringed plovers <em>Charadrius hiaticula</em> only used islands at coastal sites, whilst little ringed plovers <em>C. dubius</em> only used sparsely-vegetated islands, but at both inland and coastal sites. Common redshank <em>Tringa tetanus</em>,<em> </em>northern lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus </em>and Eurasian oystercatchers <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em> nested on islands at almost all sites. The review also examines island and platform use by grebes, divers, ground-nesting seabirds, rails and wildfowl.</p><p> </p>",

The number of plover nests increased from 5 in 1994 to 38 in 1997, and were found on 4 of the 5 created areas. The natural site has the highest number of nests in total compared to the newly and older created sites (39, 25 and 8 nests respectively). Fledge rate in 1995 was higher at the newly created site (1.4 fledglings/nest) than at the control sites in any year but declined to 0.27 fledglings/nest in 1998. Average fledge rates were similar amongst sites (0.57, 0.47 and 0.52 fledglings / nest for newly created sites, old site and natural site respectively). Created sites were dredge spoils of coarse material.</p><p> </p>",
