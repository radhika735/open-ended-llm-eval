        "background_definitions": "<p>Escape grids are frames of metal, plastics or mesh inserted in or near the codend of trawl nets to try and prevent unwanted species or sizes of catch from entering the codend. They are size selection mechanisms, the sizes at which individuals are sorted dependent on the type of panels and the mesh size and shape. Behaviour of individual fish species may also influence how effective a grid is at allowing escape; some fish will swim upwards in a net whilst others might swim down or to the sides. The effectiveness of escape panels is therefore likely to be dependent on the behaviour, shape, and size of the unwanted fish. Furthermore, constructing the codend using a square shaped mesh instead of a diamond mesh helps to maintain the net’s structure under strain, allowing a greater chance for fish to escape through the gaps of the mesh. Combining an escape grid with a square mesh codend may further increase the chance of fish escape for a greater range of species or sizes.</p>\r\n<p>The effects of using just a size-sorting escape grid or just a square mesh codend in trawl nets are summarized under<em> ‘Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net</a>’</em>, <a href=\"../../actions/2721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’ </em></a>and<a href=\"../../actions/2714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’</em></a>, respectively<em>. </em>Similar interventions of various combinations of unwanted catch reduction devices, including escape grids and square mesh codends are summarized under<a href=\"../../data/index?category_id=485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Fishing gear modification’</em></a>.</p>",

Average catch numbers of whiting of all length groups (11–41 cm) were reduced with a grid and square mesh codend (with: 0–23 fish/tow, without: 5–254 fish/tow). Average catch numbers of plaice, haddock and cod were lower for up to half of the length groups in nets with a grid and square mesh codend (plaice, with: 4–12 fish/tow, without: 1–22 fish/tow; haddock, with: 0 fish/tow, without: 4–52 fish/tow; cod, with: 0–2 fish/tow, without: 4–45 fish/tow). These included the smaller size groups of haddock and cod (see paper for data by length group). In addition, catches of marketable sizes of the target species Norway lobster <em>Nephrops norvegicus </em>were reduced in trawls with a grid and square mesh codend (with: 0.8–0.9, without: 1.2–2.0 baskets/trawl) but discards were also lower (with: 0.5, without: 2.4 baskets/trawl). In March 2006, a total of 10 paired deployments were made by a twin-rig vessel in the Farn Deeps <em>Nephrops</em> fishing ground off the coast of England. The vessel towed two trawl nets simultaneously: one 80 mm <em>Nephrops</em> trawl fitted with a metal grid (Swedish grid) and a 70 mm square mesh codend; and one standard 80 mm <em>Nephrops</em> trawl net with a 85 mm diamond mesh codend.</p>",

Average discarded catch rates of cod <em>Gadus morhua, </em>whiting <em>Merlangius merlangus</em>, haddock <em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus </em>and plaice <em>Pleuronectes platessa</em> were lower in trawl nets with a grid and square mesh codend for two of two grids (all species, with: 0.4–18.8 kg/tow, without: 2.5–67.4 kg/tow), and hake <em>Merluccius merluccius </em>was lower for the flatfish grid (with: 3.3 kg/tow, without: 9.3 kg/tow), and similar for the Nordmøre grid (with: 0.0 kg/tow, without: 0.3 kg/tow). In addition, the weight of undersized and marketable target catch of <em>Nephrops norvegicus </em>was lower for one of two grids (flatfish grid) and similar for the other. Data were collected from two trials on commercial <em>Nephrops </em>fishing grounds in Skagerrak/Kattegat in November 2002 and June 2006.

In addition, the catch rates of most unwanted fish (24 of 26 species) were similar to a square mesh codend without a grid (see paper for individual data). Catch rates of the target eastern king prawns <em>Melicertus plebejus</em> were similar between all net types (grid/square mesh codend: 264, square mesh codend: 267, standard: 274 g/ha). In July 2002, data were collected from 65 paired trawl deployments done over 10 nights off the coast of Queensland. Three different codends were tested against a standard diamond mesh codend: a standard diamond mesh with a metal, top-opening grid (Wick’s turtle excluder device), the grid in combination with a square mesh codend, and a square mesh codend alone (see paper for specifications). Each codend design was randomly assigned to the two trawl nets every 12 tows. Each tow was 2 nm long, at 2.2 knots.</p>",
