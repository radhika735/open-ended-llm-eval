Restoring such complexity is difficult, but there is an ever-increasing amount of research and investment into the area. For example, insurance firms and shipping companies are financing a 25-year project to restore forest ecosystems along the Panama Canal (TEEB 2008); whilst mining companies in Australia are increasingly able to reconstruct the forests they destroyed after they have finished mining at a site (Nichols &amp; Grant 2007).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Trees grow slowly and therefore the effects of forest restoration may not be evident for decades or even longer after restoration begins. Care must therefore be taken when interpreting the results of these studies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Some studies below describe the effects of riparian forest and buffer strip creation as a habitat type.

Sixteen species (none jarrah specialists) were only present in low numbers, compared to on three forest plots. Some revegetated areas as young as 4-5 years age, supported similar bird species numbers, densities and diversities as undisturbed forest. Techniques were improved over time, from planting eastern Australian eucalypt species (chosen for timber quality and resistance to jarrah dieback disease and resulting in plantation-like vegetation with a sparse mid- and under-storey, and few ground species) to using a eucalypt mix comprising at least 50% native species, and seeding with native understorey plants. Application of fresh topsoil promoted a higher diversity of understorey plants which in turn benefited birds. Plots planted with the same eucalypt species but without understorey planting or fresh topsoil addition had fewer bird species and lower densities.</p><p> </p>",

Counts of these species increased from 1 bird/count in 1996 to 4 birds/count in 1998. Community structure in the restored forest became more similar to rainforest and remnant vegetation sites over time, and the number of fruit-eaters (potentially important for increasing seed dispersal) recorded increased from 2 birds/count in 1996 to 4 birds/count in 1998.</p><p> </p>",

Overall, fewer species were found in natural than restored sites (60 vs. 71): 19 species were found only in natural sites; 30 species were found only in restored sites; 41 species were recorded in both sites. Over the study, 55% of the rainforest specialist species were recorded in restored sites. After 4-7 years, communities in restored sites were more similar to natural sites than younger restored sites (0-3 years old).
