Hatcheries consist of a defined location on or near the nesting beach, well above the high tide line, that is often fenced and patrolled. Nests/eggs collected from the beach are then reburied within the hatchery, where they can be closely monitored.</p>\r\n<p>Burying a potentially large number of nests/eggs within a relatively small area may present a number of risks, and the consequences of disturbances such as flooding or poaching could be particularly severe. Other environmental variables at the hatchery location (e.g. temperature and humidity) may also impact on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of the hatchlings (Warner &amp; Andrews 2002, Booth <em>et al</em>. 2006), and should be carefully considered when selecting the location.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

In 1983, all loggerhead turtle nests on one beach (53 nests) were relocated due to risk of total failure (due to predators, storm tides or poachers). Fifty clutches were reburied in hand-dug nests in a fenced area on a nearby dune and three clutches were placed in glass-fronted polystyrene incubators (38 x 38 x 19 cm).

Results were not statistically tested. The emergence rate of hatchlings from hatchery nests was 77%, compared to 71% of hatchlings from camouflaged in situ nests. The authors reported that egg poaching reduced from 85% in 2005 to 10% of eggs in 2005–2012. Nesting activity was monitored by nightly beach patrols (four 4 h long patrols) in July or August–December in 2006–2012 (98–177 nests laid/year). Nests were either relocated to an on-beach hatchery (363 nests, 40% of total), or camouflaged and left in situ (595 nests, 61% of total) to discourage illegal collecting. Relocated nests were randomly allocated a 1 m<sup>2</sup> plot in the hatchery and dug into the sand. The hatchery was monitored 24 hours a day during the nesting season. Hatchlings were monitored on emergence and nests were excavated after hatching due dates to check hatching success.</p>",

Of 1,703 olive ridley turtle nests relocated to a beach hatchery, 78% of eggs hatched (120,015 eggs) and 22% did not (33,986). Of the eggs that hatched, 77% (117,886) emerged successfully and made it to water and 1% (2,129) died. Of nests left in situ, 8 were predated and 566 experienced egg looting. In July–December 1996–2011, nesting activity was monitored by nightly beach patrols (two 3 h patrols/night, 2,401 nights and 2,535 successful nesting events). Turtles were individually marked when encountered (1,239 olive ridleys) and 1,703 (67%) nests (154,001 eggs) were moved to an on-beach hatchery on the beach behind the tide line within 6 h of being laid. The remaining nests (832, 33%) were left in situ. The hatchery was protected by a 2 m high fence buried 40 cm into the sand. Sand in the hatchery was replaced annually.

Hatching success was similar for nests in the hatchery (82%) and for those incubated in polystyrene-boxes (89% success). Hatchlings relocated to an on-beach hatchery had longer shells (41 mm straight carapace length) and faster crawl speeds (0.018 m/second) than those incubated in polystyrene boxes (length: 39 mm; crawl speed: 0.011 m/second). Carapace width, hatchling weight and righting response time were similar between hatchlings from the hatchery and polystyrene boxes (see original paper for details). In 2012–2013, eggs from 49 nests were moved to one of two treatments: buried in an on-beach hatchery (33 nests) or embedded in sand in polystyrene boxes (16 nests). Upon emergence and movement, ten hatchlings (489 individuals in total) were randomly chosen from each nest to measure size, weight, crawl speed and righting response.</p>",

Hatchery hatchlings weighed less (16 g) than natural nest hatchlings (17 g), although other measures of body size such as body length were similar between hatchlings (see paper for details). On emergence, hatchery hatchlings had higher stress hormone levels (corticosterone serum: 31 ng/mL) compared to natural nest hatchlings (27 ng/mL). On arrival at sea, hatchery hatchlings stress hormone levels did not increase compared to the levels at emergence (at sea: 32 ng/mL; emergence: 31 ng/mL), whereas natural nest hatchlings stress hormone levels did increase (at sea: 33 ng/mL; emergence: 27 ng/mL). In 2013, olive ridley turtle nests were relocated to an on-beach hatchery and reburied. Natural nests were located near the hatchery. Seventeen hatchlings each from three hatchery and three natural nests were captured randomly on emergence for to measure size and levels of stress hormones (corticosterone serum) (see original paper for details). A further 10 hatchlings from two hatchery nests and 18 from three natural nests were sampled for stress hormone levels on arrival at sea. These hatchlings were taken to a location 20 m from the sea and set free, and hormone levels were measured when they arrived at the sea.</p>",
