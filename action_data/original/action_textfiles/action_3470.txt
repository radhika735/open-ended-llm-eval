        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition: </strong>‘Environmentally-sensitive materials’ are materials that seek to maximize environmental benefits and/or minimize environmental risks of marine engineering.</p>\r\n<p>Material type influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms in subtidal rocky habitats. Settlement preferences and competition lead to some species being more abundant than others on certain materials (Andersson <em>et al.</em> 2009; Guidetti <em>et al.</em> 2004), but patterns vary by environmental conditions. Physical (lithology, hardness, porosity, colour, texture) and chemical (pH, mineralogy, toxicity) properties of rock and manufactured materials can affect how they weather over time and what communities develop on them (Coombes <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>\r\n<p>Marine artificial structures are often made from hard quarried rock, concrete, wood, steel or plastic, according to engineering requirements, cost and/or availability. Synthetic materials can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017), whereas structures made from natural rock may support more natural rocky reef communities. There may be opportunities to use more environmentally-sensitive materials in structures or in eco-engineering habitat designs added to structures to enhance their biodiversity. Concrete is commonly-used in eco-engineering designs since it is durable and easy to mould into complex shapes. Yet adding manufactured concrete habitats to structures to enhance biodiversity may not deliver a net environmental gain because of the large CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of concrete production (Heery <em>et al.</em> 2020). Concrete mixes can be manipulated to alter their physical and chemical properties (McManus <em>et al.</em> 2018; Natanzi <em>et al.</em> 2021) and environmental footprint (Dennis <em>et al.</em> 2018). Lower-footprint materials may be preferable, regardless of their effect on colonizing biodiversity; a neutral/no effect on biodiversity may still offer a higher net environmental gain (or lower net loss).</p>\r\n<p>It is often not possible to separate the effects of the various physical and chemical properties of materials on biodiversity. Studies that directly examine the effects of creating different surface textures are included under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3449\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>”; any other material comparisons are considered here. There are bodies of literature investigating the effects of material on settlement behaviour and ecological interactions in the laboratory and field (e.g. Davis <em>et al.</em> 2017; Glasby 2000), for artificial reefs and coral gardening (reviewed by Baine 2001; Spieler <em>et al.</em> 2001), and for anti-fouling applications (e.g. Hanson &amp; Bell 1976). Unless the relevance is explicitly highlighted by the authors, these studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ </em>conservation actions to promote colonization of biodiversity on marine artificial structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3449\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Andersson M.H., Berggren M., Wilhelmsson D. &amp; Öhman M.C.

Over 12 months, macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition differed on different concrete mixes (including five ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> and one standard-concrete mix), but it was not clear which materials differed in which locations (data reported as statistical model results). The same was true for their abundance (ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup>: 81–100% cover; standard-concrete: 80–92%), inorganic biomass (ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup>: 153–659 g/m<sup>2</sup>; standard-concrete: 168–332 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and coral abundance (2–16 vs 3–5 recruits in total). Organic biomass was similar on ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> (16–73 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and standard-concrete (30–79 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Settlement plates (150 × 150 mm) were moulded from six concrete mixes. Five were patented ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> mixes with reduced pH (pH 9–11), reduced Portland-cement and alternative cements and additives (details not reported) while one was standard-concrete (pH 13–14, Portland cement). Plates had textured surfaces on one side and were flat on the other. Ten of each material were randomly arranged horizontally with textured surfaces facing upwards on frames at 6 m depth in the Mediterranean Sea and at 10 m in the Gulf of Aqaba (month/year not reported). Macroalgae and invertebrates on plates were counted and biomass (dry weight) was recorded in the laboratory over 12 months.</p>",

After 24 months, the macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity was higher on ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> blocks with added habitats than standard-concrete blocks without (data reported as Shannon index) and the community composition differed (data reported as statistical model results).
