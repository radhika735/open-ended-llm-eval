If individuals from one population are released into another area, this could result in maladaptive behaviours, with birds migrating in the wrong direction, or breeding at the wrong time. Sourcing individuals for release from the area that they will be released into may, therefore, improve success rates.</p>\r\n<p>Berthold, P.

In addition, birds with wild ancestry were significantly more likely to migrate than birds only descended from captive individuals (11 of 18 storks confirmed as migrating had some wild ancestry, as did eight of ten storks that probably migrated. A total of 101 storks in the population had some wild ancestry, compared to 189 descended solely from captive storks). The original reintroduction was of 15 birds from a breeding centre in Switzerland, of which eight bred, leading to 470 descendants between 1980 and 2005. Approximately 82% of the current Swedish population is descended from four captive birds. A total of 12 native birds re-colonised, with 14% of the total population being descended from four of these.</p><p> </p>",
