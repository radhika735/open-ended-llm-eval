These must be able to allow chicks and adults to get in and out, but not predators and should be quick to install to minimise the chances of parents abandoning nests (see ‘Can nest protection increase nest abandonment?’).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Unfortunately, because each cage is over a nest, it is possible that predators will learn the association and that providing the exclosures will actually increase predation on either adults or chicks (see ‘Can nest protection increase predation of adult and chick waders?’)</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness score for this intervention included a combined assessment of the evidence for chicks of ground nesting seabirds, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/398\">chicks of waders</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/399\">chicks of storks and ibises</a></span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/400\">chicks of songbirds</a></span>.</p>",

In 1978, a pair of American kestrels <em>Falco sparverius </em>‘greatly reduced’ tern productivity at a colony by removing a tern chick approximately every 15 minutes for two hours, whereas a pair of northern harriers <em>Circus cyaneus</em> reduced productivity at another colony by 80%  in 1979 (four chicks from 20 nests escaping). In 1980, with shelters present, no kestrels or harriers were seen hunting within the tern colonies, although they were present in the vicinity.</p><p> </p>",
