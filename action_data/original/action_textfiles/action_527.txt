Fed birds did not have higher nesting success or lay earlier than controls (fed birds: 96% of 144 eggs fertilised, 94% of these hatched, average first laying date of 6<sup>th</sup> May for 27 clutches; control birds: 98% of 124 eggs fertilised, 97% of these hatched, average first laying date of 8<sup>th</sup> March for 35 clutches).
