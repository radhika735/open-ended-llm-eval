Turtle nest predation by racoons was the same for swept (16 of 16, 100% nests predated) and unswept (19 of 20, 95% nests predated) nests. Almost all artificial nests that were swept or unswept were also dug up by racoons (swept: 18 of 19, 95%; unswept: 20 of 20, 100%). Two nesting sites (112 m<sup>2</sup> and 157 m<sup>2</sup>) were divided into four adjacent, alternating areas of swept (total of 16 natural and 19 artificial nests) and unswept (total of 20 natural and 20 artificial nests) nests (2 swept and 2 unswept areas/site). A three-headed broom was dragged across the surface substrate of swept areas daily from the beginning of the monitoring period until ≥7 days after the last observed nesting event during May–July 2013–2014. In addition, artificial nests were constructed by hand and made to resemble natural nests (20 nests) or swept nests (19 nests). Predation of nests by racoons was monitored with four trail cameras at each site.</p>",

Results were not statistically tested. Hatching success was similar for nests that were camouflaged (79%) or relocated to the hatchery (79%). The emergence rate of hatchlings from camouflaged nests was 71%, compared to 77% of hatchlings from fenced hatchery nests. Egg poaching reduced from 85% in 2005 to 10% of eggs in 2006–2012. Nesting activity was monitored by nightly beach patrols (4x 4 hours/night) in July/August-December in 2006–2012 (958 nests were laid, 98–177/year). In 2006–2012, nests were either relocated to a monitored on-beach hatchery (363 nests, 38%), or camouflaged (595 nests, 61%; details of camouflaging method not provided) to discourage illegal collecting. Relocated nests were randomly allocated a 1 m<sup>2</sup> plot in the hatchery and dug into the sand. The hatchery was monitored 24 hours a day during the nesting season. Hatchlings from both treatments were monitored on emergence and nests were excavated after hatching due dates to check hatching success.</p>",
