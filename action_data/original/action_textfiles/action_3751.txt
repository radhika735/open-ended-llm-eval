Results were not statistically tested, and the effect of each intervention cannot be separated. Restored sites had a similar number of species (4 species of reptiles and amphibians) as the site with no management (3 species of reptiles and amphibians). Higher numbers of lizards were observed in the two restored sites compared to the site with no management (overall abundances not provided). In 2005–2006, restored sites (0.5 and 0.3 ha) were cleared of rubbish and exotic woody vegetation (dominated by <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em>); replanted with native vegetation; and rock piles were constructed (2–3 m diameter and 1.2 m high). The site without management (0.3 ha) had no vegetation removal or planting or rock piles. Sites were surveyed eight times each by slow, random walks between May 2009–2010.</p>",
