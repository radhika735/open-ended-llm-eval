After 14 days of diets with the probiotic, survival was improved when salmon fry were challenged with three different disease-causing bacteria, A<em>eromonas salmonicida</em>, <em>Vibrio ordalii</em>, and <em>Yersinia ruckeri</em>.<em> </em>Survival rates were 20%, 74% and 71% respectively compared to 0%, 23% and 42% in untreated controls. However, when exposed to the disease-causing bacteria, <em>Vibrio anguillarum</em>,<em> </em>salmon survival was not improved (46%)<em> </em>compared to the control group (42%). After 28 days of the diet with probiotic, improved survival was seen against all bacterial species tested compared to the control groups. 200 salmon fry were fed diets with or without the probiotic for 28 days. At seven day intervals during this 28 day period, a group of 25 salmon fry were exposed to four different disease-causing bacteria then monitored for a further 28 days.</p><p> </p>",

Adding beta-glucans to the experimental diet resulted in a further 28% reduction in infection rates whereas adding mannan oligosaccharides did not affect lice infection rates. It did improve gut function by preventing the salmon from developing soybean-induced enteritis and diarrhoea. Nine experimental diets were fed to salmon over a period of 69 to 71 feeding days. The basal diets were either based on pure fish meal or soybean and sunflower meal-soybean meal mixed with fish meal.</p><p> </p>",
