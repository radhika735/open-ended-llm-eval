Increasing power line visibility by marking them is therefore frequently proposed as a way of reducing collision-induced mortalities without the need to remove earth wires or bury transmission wires.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The reviewers noted that there was considerable variability in collision rates across all sites.

The same study also found that spans marked with BFDs and ‘flappers’ (loosely suspended polycarbon discs) had 52% lower collision mortality than spans marked just with BFDs, and 80% lower collision mortality than the same spans prior to marking. Spans with just flappers had 60% lower mortality than those with BFDs but the results are inconclusive.
