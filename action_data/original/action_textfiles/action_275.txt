Implementation of 24 h surveillance by the biomonitors resulted in a decrease in poaching from nearly 100% between 2000 and 2003, to 56% in 2004.  A team of five young people of a similar age, background and social context as poachers were recruited from local communities to monitor nests. The authors point out that it was their hope that the biomonitors would be well-placed to encourage positive conservation action by peers. This study is also discussed in ‘Relocate nestlings to reduce poaching’, ‘Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce pressures on species’, ‘Provide artificial nest sites’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’.</p><p> </p>",
