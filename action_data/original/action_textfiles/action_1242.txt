Average biomass and density were higher in watered than in control plots for: all species (watered: 355 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 28 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>; control: 28 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 23 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>), for native species (watered: 129 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 16 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>; control: 7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 11 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>) and for seeded species (watered: 34 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 7 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>; control: 1 g/m<sup>2</sup>, &lt;1 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>). For non-seeded species average biomass was higher in watered (95 g/m<sup>2</sup>) than in control plots (6 g/m<sup>2</sup>), while density was lower in watered plots (watered: 9; control: 11 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>). Thirty two plots (1 m<sup>2</sup>) of each treatment: watered (20 litre/plot, three times a week for the first six months, once a week thereafter) and control (not-watered) were established in 1998. Each plot was sown with 60 seeds of shrubs and trees. Plants biomass and density was measured 21 months after treatment.</p>",
