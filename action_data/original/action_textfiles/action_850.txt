Of the 366 breeding adults immigrating to the ponds, 84–96% captured at 3 m from ponds were first captured at 30 m. Of animals emigrating from the ponds, 58–85% of newly emerging juveniles (<em>n</em>= 2,282 captures) and 60–79% of adults captured at 3 m were subsequently captured at 30 m. Juveniles were captured 111–1,230 m from breeding ponds (<em>n</em> = 284). Standard wetland buffer zones that extended 30 m from the pond edge were simulated using drift-fencing. Fencing with pitfalls every 10 m on both sides was installed around three ponds (up to 0.35 ha) at 3 m and 30 m from the pond margin. Traps were checked daily in May–November 1999–2000 and individuals marked. Juveniles were captured emigrating from 10 ponds in 1999–2003.</p><p> </p>",

Frogs increased from seven to 10 species in the first year and then remained stable for the following six years. A total of 18 species of frogs were predicted in the area and so 56% were present following restoration. The golf course was developed in 1993 and restoration undertaken in 1997–2001. The mowing regime was changed to develop grasslands and a narrow band of herb vegetation retained around ponds as a buffer zone. In addition, native shrubs and trees were planted, non-native weeds were removed and coarse woody debris was reintroduced onto the woodland floor. Pond perimeters were walked to record frog calls in 1996–2004.</p><p> </p>",

Burrow density was significantly higher in buffered habitat (0.7 vs 0.4/m<sup>2</sup>) and individuals maintained a better body condition (mass/length: 0.09 vs 0.08) with no difference between sexes. In terms of genetic diversity, allelic richness was significantly higher in buffered compared to unbuffered woodland (82 vs 70 alleles). However, heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficients did not differ between sites. Burrows were more clumped in buffered habitat. Seven sites with ridge top buffers and eight unbuffered sites were selected. Transects were walked to estimate burrow density and distribution. Salamanders were caught, measured and tissue samples taken from 110 animals from ten sites for genetic analysis.</p><p> </p>",

When reared in ponds with buffers, Blanchard’s cricket frog <em>Acris blanchardi</em> tadpoles had significantly greater survival (0.5 vs 0.2) and mass (0.4 vs 0.3 g) at one site of three sites and green frog <em>Rana clamitans </em>tadpoles had significantly lower survival (0.1 vs 0.4–0.7) and mass (3.0–4.0 vs 1.5–2.5 g) at two sites. Mass was significantly lower at one buffered site for green frogs (0.5 vs 2.5 g). Rate of development did not differ in buffered and unbuffered ponds. In 2008, 40 green or cricket frog tadpoles were placed in ten enclosures in two ponds at three sites, one pond with and without a 1 m unmown terrestrial buffer zone.
