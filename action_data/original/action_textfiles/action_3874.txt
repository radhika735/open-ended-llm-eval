Planting native trees in logged areas of natural forest may help to speed up the process of succession and redevelopment of the forest structure, while planting native trees in logged plantations may encourage the restoration of native forest in the area. Note that many species of butterfly and moth do well in early successional woodland after disturbance, but these species may represent a different community to those found in established, pristine forest.</p>",

However, using statistical models, replanted forest had lower estimated species richness (66–75) than the clear-cut area (66–75 vs 77–128). Butterfly community diversity was lower in all three diversity metrics in replanted forest than clear-cut or primary forest, and in two of three metrics than secondary forest (data presented as diversity indices). Differences between habitat types were not tested statistically. Butterfly community compositions in the replanted forest, naturally regenerated secondary forest and primary forest were more similar to each other than to the clear-cut area, but replanted forest and naturally regenerated secondary forest community were more similar to each other than to the primary forest (data presented as similarity index results). Four habitat patches were surveyed, all within a 40 ha area and ~250 m apart from each other, on the boundary of Kakum National Park: young forest planted nine years ago with <em>Ceiba pentandra, Chlorophora excelsa, Terminalia ivoriensis </em>and <em>Khaya ivoriensis</em>,  middle-aged naturally regenerated secondary forest, old primary forest and an area which was previously primary forest but was clear cut one year prior to the first surveying year. Patch size was not given. Eight banana-baited traps were established 30 m apart in each of the sampled patches, and operated for 12 consecutive days, three times each in 2007 and 2009. Butterflies were collected from traps daily.</p>",
