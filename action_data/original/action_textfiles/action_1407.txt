The number of flower species and the amount of bare ground did not differ significantly between hedgerows and weedy edges (6 vs 4 species; amount of bare ground not reported), but floral cover was higher and there was more dead wood in hedgerows (amounts not reported). <strong>Methods: </strong>Native perennial shrubs (305–550 x 7 m), bordered by native perennial grasses (3 m), were planted in 1996–2003 on the edges of six fields (hedgerows) and compared to the unplanted edges of six fields (weedy edges).
