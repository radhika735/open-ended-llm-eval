For particularly sensitive species or populations, or in areas subject to high levels of disturbance, it may be possible to reduce human disturbance with signs or access restrictions. Reducing access helps to reduce the risk of human introduction of non-native plants, animals or disease.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
