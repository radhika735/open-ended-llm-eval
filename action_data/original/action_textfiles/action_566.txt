This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, or simply increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations are also frequently used to move birds to areas that have been cleared of invasive predators, particularly on islands. This intervention is not the same as that of periodically moving next boxes to prevent predators from learning their locations, discussed in ‘Invasive and other problematic species’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Those translocations involving larger numbers of individuals, translocations of native game species (rather than threatened species), and translocations into the core (rather than the periphery) of the species’ historical range were most likely to establish self-sustaining populations.</p><p> </p>",
