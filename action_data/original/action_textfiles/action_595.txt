From a captive population of between 11 and 45 individuals (with 41 taken from the wild over the study period), a maximum of 19 young/year were produced, with a total of 90 over the study period. This was equivalent to 1.45 young/nest, lower than in wild birds, possibly due to high levels of pre-fledging mortality due overcrowding in the cages. Forty-six young were healthy and 67 individuals were released. Post-release survival is discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ and this study is also described in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’.</p><p> </p>",

About 800 additional birds are also thought to be present in captivity but are not registered. However, a programme at a group of zoos, headed by Munich Zoo, failed to establish a productive captive colony for three years. The authors note that ibises frequently swallow small objects they find including nails and wire, which has led to many birds dying from a punctured gut. This study is also discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations’, ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’, ‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Release birds as adults or sub-adults, not juveniles’, ‘Clip birds’ wings on release’, ‘Use microlites to help birds migrate’ and ‘Foster birds with non-conspecifics’.</p><p> </p>",
