There were no corresponding differences in the number of blowfly <em>Protocalliphora </em>spp. pupae  (3.3 and 2.5 pupae/nest for experimental and control nests respectively), nestling mass (23.5 g in experimental nests vs. 23.8 g in controls), nestling leukocyte profiles, or proportion of young fledging (5.3 fledglings/nest for experimental nests vs. 5.1 fledglings/nest for controls). The authors speculate that adult tree swallows may increase provisioning rate to compensate for flea parasitism.</p><p> </p>",
