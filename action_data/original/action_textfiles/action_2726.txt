        "background_definitions": "<p>Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Trawl nets may be fitted with devices that aim to enable unwanted catch to escape (“bycatch reduction devices”). A wide variety of different devices have been developed, including size-sorting escape grids and supported openings, each designed to allow specific species or sizes to escape while at the same time minimising losses of marketable catch. Fitting escape grids in combination with a large, supported opening should increase the likelihood of fish escape by providing fish (potentially of different species or sizes) with an additional opportunity to make contact with one or other of the devices.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for the individual effects of size-sorting escape grids and large, supported escape openings in trawl nets is summarized under ‘<em>Fishing gear modification - <a href=\"../../actions/2720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a fish trawl net</a>’</em>,<a href=\"../../actions/2721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Fit a size-sorting grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’</em></a>, and<a href=\"../../actions/2723\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> ‘Fit large, supported escape openings (such as Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections) to trawl nets’</em></a>.

Data were reported as percentage reductions. The weight of unwanted fish caught in experimental trials of the modified nets was lower than conventional trawls: by 14–16% with a combined Super Shooter grid and Fisheye escape opening, by 28–31% with a Nordmøre grid and a Fisheye, and by 29–39% with a Nordmøre grid and a square mesh window. The Super Shooter/Fisheye system caught similar weights of commercial target prawns <em>Penaeidae</em> relative to conventional trawls (91–95%), while both Nordmøre systems caught less (Nordmøre/Fisheye: 14–18%, Nordmøre/square mesh: 17–34%). Standard prawn trawl nets were fitted with a combination of catch reduction devices: one of two size-sorting escape grids (‘Super Shooter’ or ‘Nordmøre’) and either a single large escape opening (‘Fisheye’) or a square mesh escape window in the codend. Paired trawl deployments, each with a different modified trawl, were conducted in experimental trials in October 1995 (146 paired tows, length 120 min). Full details of the gear designs are provided in the original study.</p>",

Shark catches were reduced by 18% and ray catches by 36% in trawls with a ‘Bigeye’ opening in combination with an excluder grid, compared to a conventional trawl. There was no statistical difference in overall catch of sawfish between gear types (grid/Bigeye: 17 fish, conventional: 32 fish). Trawl nets with a Bigeye/grid reduced commercial target prawn <em>Penaidae</em> catches by 6% compared to the conventional trawl. In August-November 2001, data were collected from 23 prawn fishing vessels towing twin trawls, one modified and one conventional, with a total of 1,612 tows for 3–4 hours each, on either side of the vessel. Modified trawls were fitted with an upward-angled grid with an escape outlet plus a ‘Bigeye’ escape opening nearer to the codend and were paired with a conventional trawl used by the prawn fishery.

Average shark catch rates in mongoose nets (most commonly used commercially) fitted with ‘Super Shooter’ grids were similar with and without a ‘Fisheye’ escape opening in the codend (with: 15 sharks net/h, without: 17 sharks net/h). In addition, compared to other trawl/grid types without Fisheyes, shark catch rate with the mongoose/Super Shooter/Fisheye combination was not significantly different (mongoose/Georgia Jumper: 2, flat net/Super Shooter: 2, triple wing net/Super Shooter: 23 sharks/net/h). In April 1995–January 1998 (except February and March), data were collected by fishery observers from 30 trawl deployments using mongoose, flat and triple wing nets, carried out by commercial vessels fishing for shrimp. All nets had a size-sorting escape grid (Super Shooter or Georgia Jumper). Nine mongoose net deployments were made with the supported escape opening (Fisheye) and eight without.
