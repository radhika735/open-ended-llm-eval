This was thought to be due to over-wintering at cooler temperatures, to simulate the harsh weather faced in the wild. Breeding pairs were carefully selected from a studbook of the 150 captive toads. Pairs were housed in separate water tanks. Toads were injected with hormones to induce production of eggs and sperm. Over 20 breeding events were undertaken each year. Most toads are released as tadpoles in autumn.</p><p> </p>",

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRHa) both induced significantly higher proportions of males to release sperm than controls (82 vs 0%). LHRHa treated males released significantly higher numbers of sperm (670 vs 50) and concentration of sperm (4,500 vs 800 x 103/ml) over a longer period than those treated with human chorionic gonadotropin. There was no significant difference in numbers of females releasing eggs following LHRHa and controls (30 vs 0%). Eggs were released 24–48 hours post-treatment (peak 36 hours). Average clutch size was 15. Six randomly selected males were given a dose of either 20 μg/g bodyweight of human chorionic gonadotropin or 5 μg/g of LHRHa in simplified amphibian Ringer solution (SAR) or a control of 0.1 ml of SAR.
