A non-significant difference was also seen for common redshank <em>Tringa totanus</em> (39% vs. 21%). There were no differences in treatment during 1993-4, before payments. The number of control farms was reduced to three in 1995-6, because the farmers on other farms had become too involved in conservation for their farms still to be considered true controls. No other bird conservation measures were in place and the cost was estimated at €40/clutch. Population-level impacts were not observed, possibly due to the relatively short time-scale and small number of farms.</p><p> </p>",

However, birds were not more abundant under either scheme, compared with controls (approximately 125 birds/plot for combined schemes; 125 birds/plot for per-clutch payment and 110 birds/plot for controls). Wader breeding densities were higher (but not significantly so) on combined and per-clutch payment plots (approximately 7 territories/plot for combined schemes; 7 territories/plot for per-clutch payment and 5 territories/plot for controls).<strong> </strong>When individual wader species were analysed, there were higher numbers of redshank <em>Tringa totanus </em>on combined or per-clutch payment plots (approximately 5 birds/plot for combined schemes; 5 birds/plot for per-clutch payment and 3 birds/plot for controls), but there were no significant differences in breeding densities for redshank, northern lapwing <em>Vanellus vanellus</em>, Eurasian oystercatcher <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em> or black-tailed godwit <em>Limosa limosa</em>. The authors suggest that groundwater depth, soil hardness and prey density drove these patterns. All farms had been operating the schemes for at least three (and an average of four) years before the study. This study is also discussed in ‘Delay haying/mowing’.</p><p> </p>",
