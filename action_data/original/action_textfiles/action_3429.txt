After two years, plant cover was higher in areas that were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and sown with seeds (36%) than in areas where seeds were sown but no mycorrhizal fungi were added (28%). However, after three years, plant cover was not significantly different in areas that were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and sown with seeds (50%) and areas where seeds were sown but no mycorrhizal fungi were added (37%). In May 1992, four blocks consisting of two 4 × 2.5 m plots were established. In each block, one 4 x 2.5 m plot was inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi by applying 2.5 g of <em>Sorghum sudanense</em> root material infected with fungi, and one plot was not inoculated. All plots were sown with a mixture of native plant species at a rate of 30.4 kg/ha. Plant cover was measured in all plots in August 1993 and 1994 using three 1-m wide transects.</p>",

Twelve months after the plants were transplanted to a field, those with added mycorrhiza were taller (79–85 cm) than those grown in untreated soil (63–79 cm). Survival of plants grown in soil with added mycorrhizal fungi was 90–100% compared to 82–95% for plants grown in untreated soil, although these results were not tested for statistical difference. Plants were grown in pots filled with heat-treated soil. Mycorrhizal fungi from local soil was added to the soil in 105 pots, while 105 pots were left untreated. Pots were sown with either three or ten seeds and watered regularly. Emergence was monitored weekly for eight weeks.
