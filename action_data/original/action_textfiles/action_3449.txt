        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Texture’ is micro-scale roughness applied to an entire surface that produces depressions and/or elevations ≤1 mm (Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Texture influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms in subtidal rocky habitats. It provides secure anchor points for invertebrate larvae and algal germlings, helping them to resist dislodgement and escape predation or grazing (Carl <em>et al.</em> 2012). Settlement preferences and competitive interactions lead to some species being more abundant than others on textured surfaces (Bourget <em>et al.</em> 1994). These patterns vary by species, environmental conditions and the match or mismatch between the size and shape of the texture and organisms (Wahl &amp; Hoppe 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Most substrates have some form of texture, but marine artificial structures often have smoother surface texture than natural rocky substrates (Sedano <em>et al. </em>2020). Structures with rougher texture tend to be more-readily colonized by invertebrates and algae (Miller &amp; Barimo 2001; Sempere-Valverde <em>et al.</em> 2018; but see Bourget <em>et al.</em> 1994), promoting community development. Textured surfaces can be created on subtidal artificial structures by moulding or treating surfaces during construction or retrospectively. Texture can also be altered indirectly through material choice. Studies that examine the effects of using alternative materials with incidentally-different textures are not considered here, but are included under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3470\"><em>Use environmentally-sensitive material on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p>There are bodies of literature investigating field and laboratory-based settlement behaviour on textured surfaces (e.g. Maldonado &amp; Uriz 1998; Neo <em>et al.</em> 2009) and also the use of micro-texture for anti-fouling applications (reviewed by Scardino &amp; de Nys 2011). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to promote colonization of biodiversity on marine artificial structures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3470\"><em>Use environmentally-sensitive material on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3455\"><em> Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3448\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <em><a href=\"../../actions/3453\">Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3444\">Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</a></em>;<a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em> Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Bourget E., DeGuise J. &amp; Daigle G.

After nine months, there was no clear difference in the macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition, species richness or live cover on plates with and without textured surfaces (data reported as statistical model results). Non-mobile invertebrates were more abundant on plates with texture (&lt;1–6% cover) than without (&lt;1–2%) but the difference was only significant at one of six sites. Macroalgal abundances varied by species group and site (see paper for results). Limestone, sandstone, granite and concrete settlement plates (150 × 100 mm) were made with and without textured surfaces. Five of each material-texture combination were randomly arranged, horizontally at 5 m depth in each of two sites on each of three limestone rocky reefs in February 2005.

After 14 months, pilings with textured surfaces and environmentally-sensitive material supported 18 macroalgae and invertebrate species with 90–100% cover, while fibreglass pilings without texture supported nine species with 40–85% cover (data not statistically tested). Biomass was higher on pilings with textured surfaces (0.07 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) than without (0.02 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) and the community composition differed (data reported as statistical model results). Over 14 months, six species (4 non-mobile invertebrates, 2 mobile invertebrates) recorded on pilings with texture were absent from those without. It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating textured surfaces or using environmentally-sensitive material.
