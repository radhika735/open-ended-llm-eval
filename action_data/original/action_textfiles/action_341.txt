Exotic shrubs and woody debris were removed and chipped before herbicide was applied to the root crowns of exotic species. This compared with an 18% increase at four sites with fuel reduction but no planting and a 42% decrease at two sites where debris was burned and no shrubs planted. These results are discussed in more detail in ‘Manually control/remove understorey and midstorey vegetation’ and ‘Use prescribed burning’.</p><p> </p>",
