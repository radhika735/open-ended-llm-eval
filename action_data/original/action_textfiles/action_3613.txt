Mackerel bait increased the number of terrapins caught (1.2 entries/terrapin/h) compared to chicken or no bait, which produced similar results (chicken: 0.6; no bait: 0.2 entries/terrapin/h). In total, 25 wild terrapins were caught to participate in three randomly ordered trials: mackerel bait, chicken bait and no bait. A single crab pot with chimney was used to test each bait type. Terrapins were monitored by webcam in 90-minute videos/treatment.</p>",

Unwanted catch of all turtles in hoop nets was reduced with soap bait (7 turtles/net deployment) compared to cheese bait (11 turtles/net deployment). Turtle mortality was reduced with soap bait compared to cheese (data reported as statistical model outputs). Catch rates of commercially targeted catfish were similar between soap-baited (1,613 individuals) and cheese-baited hoop nets (1,429 individuals) although soap-baited nets caught larger catfish (344 mm average length) compared to cheese-baited (321 mm). In June 2014, four to six tandem hoop net combinations (three nets/combination, each 3.4 m long with 25 mm bar mesh and seven 0.8 m hoops) were deployed at &lt;4 m depths in 13 reservoirs (70 total net deployments, two sampling periods). Nets were either baited with 800g cheese logs or 800g Zote Â© soap. Nets were fished for two days; all animals were removed and nets were then reset with the opposite bait and fished for a further two days. In total six turtle species were caught, of which three species (red-eared slider <em>Trachemys scripta elegans</em>, common musk <em>Sternotherus odoratus</em> and common snapping turtles <em>Chelydra serpentina</em>) were caught frequently enough to assess differences in mortality by bait type.</p>",
