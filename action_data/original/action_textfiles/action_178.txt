In much of Europe, hedges are being removed as field sizes are increased, potentially reducing the biodiversity value of farmland. Planting new hedges may mitigate this change, but may be both costly and unattractive to farmers, as they can reduce the efficiency of farming.</p>",

Although this study does not isolate the effect of the individual interventions made, it is noted that 14 of 33 new coveys were located in multi-flora hedges planted during the eight years of management interventions. Interventions included planting shrub lespedeza <em>Lespedeza thunbergii </em>and sericea lespedeza <em>Lespedeza cuneata</em> strips, seeding 20 ha of grassland, and limiting livestock grazing. Sightings of coveys were reported by farm employees and hunting parties during each winter from 1956 to 1965.</p>",
