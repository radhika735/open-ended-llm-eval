In 1992, trees and shrubs were removed from an area of scree in the Pieniny Mountains, creating a corridor between the locations of two Apollo butterfly populations. From 1991–1994, captive bred butterflies were also released annually at the site (339 males, 362 females and four pupae in total). Butterfly numbers were recorded each year but survey details are not provided.

In sprayed plots, the number of butterfly visits (12 individuals/plot), the time spent in the plot (34–154 seconds/visit), and the proportion of butterflies which landed (18–73%) did not differ significantly from unsprayed plots (visits: 10 individuals/plot; time: 40–98 seconds/visit; landed: 16–67%). Similarly, in sprayed plots, the number of eggs (3.9/subplot), caterpillars (1.3/subplot) and survival of eggs to large caterpillars (15%) did not differ significantly from unsprayed plots (eggs: 4.1/subplot; caterpillars: 1.3/subplot; survival: 14%). In March 2013, thirty-two plots (20 × 20 m) were paired based on equal host plant (Kincaid’s lupine <em>Lupinus oreganus</em>) cover (&gt;15 m<sup>2</sup>/plot). In each pair, one plot was randomly assigned to the herbicide treatment (sprayed in March with 326 g/ha Fusilade DX® grass-specific herbicide and 425 g/ha Nufilm®) and the other was left unsprayed. In May 2013, the time spent in each plot by adult butterflies, and whether or not they landed, was recorded during 15-minute observations in 30 plots. From late April 2013, hatched and unhatched eggs were counted five times, and the number and size of caterpillars was counted eight times, at 4–5 day intervals in each of three 60 × 60 cm subplots/plot, centred on randomly selected flowering lupines.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, randomized, controlled study in 2013–2014 in a greenhouse in Washington, USA (Schultz et al. 2016) found that one of three herbicides commonly used to control invasive grasses reduced the survival of snowberry checkerspot <em>Euphydryas colon</em> caterpillars, but not Edith’s checkerspot <em>Euphydryas editha colonia</em> or Baltimore checkerspot <em>Euphydryas phaeton</em> caterpillars. The survival of snowberry checkerspot caterpillars sprayed with sethoxydom and NuFilm (78%) was lower than caterpillars sprayed with water (98%), but the survival of caterpillars sprayed with clethodim and NuFilm (85%), fluazifop-p-butyl and NuFilm (88%) or NuFilm alone (93%) was not significantly different from those sprayed with water. The survival of caterpillars sprayed with fluazifop-p-butyl and NuFilm (snowberry checkerspot: 51–89%; Edith’s checkerspot: 87–88%; Baltimore checkerspot: 91–95%) was not significantly lower than unsprayed caterpillars (snowberry: 55–92%; Edith’s: 84–92%; Baltimore: 96–98%). Eggs were collected from wild-caught females (snowberry and Edith’s checkerspot) or wild-laid egg clusters (Baltimore checkerspot), and caterpillars were reared on ribwort plantain <em>Plantago lanceolata</em>. In August 2014, forty snowberry checkerspot caterpillars were exposed to each of five treatments: one of three herbicides used regularly for prairie restoration (fluazifop-p-butyl, sethoxydim and clethodim) applied using their most common formulations (Fusilade DX<sup>®</sup>, Poast<sup>®</sup> and Envoy Plus<sup>®</sup>, respectively) in combination with a “sticker-spreader” (adjuvant NuFilm IR<sup>®</sup>); the NuFilm alone; or a water treatment (see paper for details). Caterpillars were kept in containers and fed fresh plantain exposed to the same treatment. In August–September 2013, caterpillars of three species were randomly assigned to two treatments, sprayed with Fusilade and NuFilm or unsprayed, and placed in groups of 20 in 5–6 host plant microcosms/treatment/species. In both experiments, survival to overwintering was recorded.</p>",
