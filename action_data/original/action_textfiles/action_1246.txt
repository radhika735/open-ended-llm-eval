Species richness and cover of mosses was higher in leaf litter removal plots than in control plots after four years and remained higher until the end of the experiment (average 4-15 years of removal: 8 species, 35% cover; control: 0 species and 0% cover). Vascular plant cover was lower in leaf litter removal plots than in control plots after 13 years of treatment (average 13-15 years of removal: 55%; control: 85%). Vascular plant species richness was higher in leaf litter removal plots than in control plots after 10 years (average 10-13 years of removal: 17; control: 9 species) and then became similar between treatments after 14 years of treatment (average 14-15 years: 16; control: 11 species). Monitoring was in three pairs of 5 × 5 m plots for two treatments: leaf litter removed (litter raked and removed every year 1983-1998) and controls (litter not removed).</p><p> </p>",

The density of new tree seedlings was higher in control (0.5/m<sup>2</sup>) than in litter removal plots (0.3/m<sup>2</sup>) in forest areas, and similar between treatments in artificial gaps (control: 3.0/m<sup>2</sup>; litter removal: 2.7/m<sup>2</sup>). In 1997, large gaps (320–540 m<sup>2</sup>) were created inside five 40 × 40 m plots (gap plots) by cutting and removing all tree stems ≥5 cm diameter at breast height. Five other similar size plots (non-gap plots) were unmanipulated with respect to canopy cover. Five blocks were established within each plot, each comprised of two 2 × 2 m quadrats one of each of litter removal and a control with no litter removal. Data were taken every two months for one year after treatments.</p><p> </p>",
