        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Texture’ is micro-scale roughness applied to an entire surface that produces depressions and/or elevations ≤1 mm (Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Texture influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms in intertidal rocky habitats. It provides secure anchor points for invertebrate larvae and algal germlings, helping them to resist dislodgement and escape predation or grazing (Lubchenco 1983). Settlement preferences and competitive interactions lead to some species being more abundant than others on textured surfaces (Harlin &amp; Lindbergh 1977). These patterns vary by species, environmental conditions and the match or mismatch between the size and shape of the texture and organisms (Wahl &amp; Hoppe 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Most substrates have some form of texture, but marine artificial structures often have smoother surface texture than natural rocky substrates (Sedano <em>et al. </em>2020). Structures with rougher texture tend to be more-readily colonized by invertebrates and algae (Moschella <em>et al.</em> 2005; Sempere-Valverde <em>et al.</em> 2018; but see Cacabelos <em>et al.</em> 2016), promoting community development. Textured surfaces can be created on intertidal artificial structures by moulding or treating surfaces during construction or retrospectively. Texture can also be altered indirectly through material choice. Studies that examine the effects of using alternative materials with incidentally-different textures are not considered here, but are included under the action “<a href=\"../../actions/3469\"><em>Use environmentally-sensitive material on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p>There are bodies of literature investigating the effects of textured surfaces on recruitment and community development in intertidal rocky habitats (e.g. Dudgeon &amp; Petraitis 2005; van Tamelin <em>et al.</em> 1997), laboratory-based settlement behaviour (e.g. Neo <em>et al.</em> 2009), and also the use of micro-texture for anti-fouling applications (reviewed by Scardino &amp; de Nys 2011). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to promote colonization of biodiversity on marine artificial structures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <em><a href=\"../../actions/3469\">Use environmentally-sensitive material on intertidal artificial structures</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3435\">Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</a></em>;<a href=\"../../actions/3475\"><em> Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3473\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <em><a href=\"../../actions/3462\">Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3464\">Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</a></em>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions</em>, <em>ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Cacabelos E., Martins G.M., Thompson R., Prestes A.C.L., Azevedo J.M.N. &amp; Neto A.I.

After 18 months, plates with and without texture supported similar macroalgae and mobile invertebrate species richness in seven of eight comparisons (textured: 1–2 species/plate; untextured: 1/plate). At one site (1 comparison), cast-textured plates supported more species (2/plate) than untextured plates (1/plate). Textured and untextured plates also supported similar mobile invertebrate abundance in five of eight comparisons (textured: 1–2 individuals/plate; untextured: 1–3/plate). At one site (3 comparisons), textured plates supported more mobile invertebrates (3–5 individuals/plate) than untextured plates (1/plate). Barnacle (Cirripedia) cover was higher on plates with texture (67–95%) than without (22–83%) in six of eight comparisons, but did not significantly differ at one site (2 comparisons; textured: 46–51%; untextured: 22%). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating texture or using environmentally-sensitive material on some plates. Settlement plates (150 × 150 mm) were made with and without textured surfaces, created by scraping with a wire brush, moulding with barnacle-shaped impressions, or casting with crushed foil. ‘Scrape-textured’, ‘mould-textured’ and untextured plates were concrete, while ‘cast-textured’ plates were limestone-cement (environmentally-sensitive material). Eight plates with each of scrape-textured, mould-textured and untextured surfaces were randomly arranged at upper-midshore on each of three vertical concrete seawalls in April–May 2016.
