It may be undertaken as a deliberate conservation intervention to benefit certain bird species, but with the potential to adversely affect understorey species that utilise accumulated dead wood for foraging or nesting.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Midstorey-, canopy- and cavity-nesting species such as red-headed woodpecker <em>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</em>, great crested flycatcher <em>Myiarchus crinitus</em>, eastern towhee <em>Piplio erythrophthalmus</em> and eastern wood-pewee<em> Contopus virens</em> were found at lower densities in removal plots. Pine warbler <em>Dendroica pinus</em> and indigo bunting <em>Passerina cyanea</em> were found at similar densities and summer tanagers <em>Piranga rubra </em>were found at higher densities.
