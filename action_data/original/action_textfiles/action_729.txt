        "background_definitions": "<p>Beetle banks are raised strips which run through a field, typically planted with grasses. They primarily serve as an overwintering habitat for beetles, which provide pest control in the spring, but may also harbour other natural enemies. By dividing the field, beetle banks reduce the distance that predators have to travel to reach the centre of the crop, a potential problem if overwintering habitat occurs only at the field edge. Beetles are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps, but these measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground; pitfall trap data therefore refer to ‘activity densities’.</p>",

In 1989, the ground beetle <em>Demetrias atricapillus</em> was initially more abundant 0-3 m from the beetle bank (average 12.2 individuals/m², 14 April-3 May) but became more evenly distributed with an average 0.4 individuals/m² at 0-60 m from the bank (8-22 May). The rove beetle <em>Tachyporus hypnorum</em> did not show a consistent distribution in 1989-1990, although fewer individuals were found on the bank than the crop by the end of the 1989 survey. More money spiders (Linyphiidae) were found in the beetle bank than the crop in 1989 and in 1990 there was a slight emigration of money spiders away from the bank into the crop. In 1990 wolf spiders (Lycosidae) were found throughout the crop but were most abundant next to the beetle bank. The beetle bank (290 m long, 0.4 m high and 1.5 m wide) was created in autumn 1986 and sown with grasses.

Invertebrate predators included ground beetles (Carabidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae) and spiders (Araneae). In 1989, emigration patterns of the rove beetle <em>Tachyporus hypnorum</em> and the ground beetle <em>Demetrias atricapillus</em> showed movement of individuals from the bank into the field from 14 April-22 May. From 14 April-3 May, there were 12.2 individuals/m² of <em>D. atricapillus</em> at 0-3 m from the bank, after which the average density was 0.4 individuals/m² at 0-60 m from the bank.

There were eight 30 x 30 m plots, each divided into two 30 x 15 m subplots. Four pairs of subplots were separated by a 3.3 m-wide, 0.10 m-high refuge strip and four pairs had no refuge strip. The field was in a three-year crop rotation of soybean <em>Glycine max</em>, oats <em>Avena sativa</em> and maize <em>Zea mays</em>. The central 0.3 m section of refuge strips was planted with three perennial flowering plant species and a grass-legume seed mix was sown on either side of the flowering plants. Ground beetles were sampled in May-October in three pitfall traps/refuge strip or control area and six traps/subplot in the surrounding crop area.</p><p> </p>",

There were fewer potato leafhoppers <em>Empoasca fabae</em> in fields with grass corridors (Rodenhouse <em>et al</em>. 1992). One study from 1988 (and updated in 1994) calculated that establishing a beetle bank in a 20 ha field could save £660 (US$1,090) if an aphid-induced yield loss of 5% was prevented and £300/year (US$495) in pesticide and labour costs if natural enemy populations kept aphid (Aphididae) numbers below a spray threshold (Wratten 1988, Wratten &amp; van Emden 1995). Economic costs of establishing a beetle bank in a 20 ha field were approximately £85 (US$140) in year one based on: labour cost (1-2 days), yield loss from land taken out of production (assuming an average yield of 6 t/ha at £110/t, or US$180/t) and cost of grass seed (£5 or US$8). Gross yield lost in subsequent years because of the beetle bank taking up production land was calculated at £30 (US$50).</p><p>Additional references:</p><p>Rodenhouse N.L., Barrett G.W., Zimmerman D.M. &amp; Kemp J.C. (1992) Effects of uncultivated corridors on arthropod abundances and crop yields in soybean agroecosystems. <em>Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment</em>, 38, 179-191</p><p>Wratten S.D.
