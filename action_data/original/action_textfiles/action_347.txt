Very dense vegetation can exclude open-water species from a wetland, meaning that treating the wetland with a herbicide may be beneficial. However, conservationists should be aware that some herbicides, such as glyphosate, can be extremely toxic to amphibians and fish (Relyea 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Relyea, R.A.
