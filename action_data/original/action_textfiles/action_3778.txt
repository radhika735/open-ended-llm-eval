Twenty of 53 (38%) released head-started crocodiles were caught at least once in four years following release (see original paper for details).

Eggs were artificially incubated in captivity (no details are provided). An annual quota set by the government required 5% of three-year-old crocodiles were returned to the wild. In total, 355 head-started crocodiles were returned to the wild by the end of 1973, of which 53 released into one site were monitored by twice-yearly recapture surveys in 1970–1974.</p>",
