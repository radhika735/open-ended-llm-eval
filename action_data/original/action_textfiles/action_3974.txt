Results were not tested for statistical significance. Four years after field edges were increased and meadows and field margins created, 24 species of butterflies and burnet moths were present on the farm, compared to 20 species before creation. Marbled white <em>Melanargia galathea</em> were present at eight survey sites in 1991, compared to one site in 1987. In 1987, on an intensively managed 30-ha farm with large fields, the length of field edges was increased from 7,200 m to 17,420 m. Semi-natural meadows and field margins were created by sowing regional plant species including rosebay willowherb <em>Epilobium angustifolium, </em>danewort <em>Sambucus ebulus</em>, heather <em>Calluna vulgaris </em>and regional meadow seeds. From May–August 1987–1988 and 1991, butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed at sample sites (number not specified) across the whole farm.</p>",

Twelve arable farms with small fields (average: 31,600 m<sup>2</sup>) in diverse landscapes (15% arable land, 19% pasture), and 12 arable farms with large fields (average: 60,200 m<sup>2</sup>) in intensively farmed landscapes (70% arable land, 3% pasture) were selected.

In Poland, the land had been managed as small, family farms for decades, whereas in the Czech Republic the field sizes were on average 10-times larger than in Poland (average field sizes not given).
