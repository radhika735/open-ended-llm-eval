The number of saplings/100 m<sup>2</sup> was higher in low-intensity (0.54-0.66) than in high- and medium-intensity grazing plots. Four plots for each grazing intensity: high (2.1-3.8 sheep/ha); medium (1.2-2.0 sheep/ha) or low (0.6-1.2 sheep/ha) were established in 1986. Saplings (&gt;30 cm diameter at breast height) were monitored in 2003 in 20 quadrats (10 × 10 m) within each plot.</p><p> </p>",

Understory production (kg/ha dry matter) was higher in non- and lightly-grazed (~4,500) than in moderately-grazed (~2,800) and heavily-grazed sites (~1,000). A study area of 2,000 ha was divided into six forest segments, each was divided into three areas with different stocking densities (goats and cattle): heavy (15 animals/ha), moderate (5 animals/ha) and light (0.2 animals/ha). Sixty plots (1 m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly placed in every grazing treatment in all stands and protected from grazing at the end of 2004. Similar size plots with grazing close to protected (control) plots were sampled for comparison. Overall understory (herbage and browse) production was measured in 1991 and in September 2005.</p><p> </p>",
