Urine contamination of ejaculate samples was high in all 4 species (25 individuals) analysed (37% for golden eagle <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>, 43% for Spanish imperial eagle <em>Aquila adalberti</em>, 29% for Bonelli’s eagle <em>A. fasciatus </em>(also <em>Hieraaetus fasciatus</em>) and 48% for peregrine falcon <em>Falco peregrinus</em>) and significantly reduced semen pH (6.5-6.9 compared to 7.2-7.6). However, sperm motility was significantly higher in sperm washed with an alkalinised diluent (compared to a neutral diluent). An intramagnal insemination technique of washed semen produced 1 golden eagle and 2 peregrine falcon nestlings (11 and 16% of clutch size respectively). Each sperm sample was divided into two equal amounts and washed with either neutral (pH 7.0) or alkalinised (pH 8.0) diluent (Lake’s formula with 300 mg / 100 ml of citric acid added) before being incubated for 30 min (21°C).</p><p> </p>",
