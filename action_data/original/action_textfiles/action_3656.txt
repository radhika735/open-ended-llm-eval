In one of two burn years, capture rates of six-lined racerunners <em>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</em> and eastern fence lizards <em>Sceloporus undulatus</em> were lower in plots with burning and herbicide (six-lined racerunners: 0.016 captures/trap days; eastern fence lizards: 0.003) than in burn-only plots (racerunners: 0.037; fence lizards: 0.007), but higher than in unburned plots with no herbicide (racerunners: 0.015; fence lizards: 0.002). In the other year, captures were similar all three treatments (racerunners: 0.011–0.017; fence lizards: 0.001–0.006). In one of two years southeastern crowned snake <em>Tantilla coronata </em>captures were lower in burning with herbicide and burning only plots (0.004–0.005) compared to plots with no burning or herbicide (0.014), but in the other year captures were similar (0.011–0.020). Green anoles <em>Anolis carolinensis</em> were not caught in burning and herbicide plots and were caught a similar amount in burn only and no burning or herbicide plots (0.003). Little brown skink <em>Scincella lateralis</em> captures were similar across all treatments (0.001–0.005).  Treatments (burning with herbicide or burn only) were randomly assigned to 81 ha plots within four replicate blocks. Burn-only treatments were carried out in spring 1995. Herbicide treatments were carried out in 1995 and were then burned in March–April 1997. Data were also collected from four frequently-burned reference sites. Monitoring was undertaken using drift-fencing and pitfall traps in April–August 1997–1998.</p>",

All results reported as statistical model outputs, see original paper for details. Reptile communities in sites treated with herbicide then burned remained similar to unburned sites and different to areas of pristine habitat (1–2 years post treatment). Reptile communities in sites that were only burned were different to both unburned sites and areas of pristine habitat. After 10–12 years of all sites receiving regular burning, all reptile communities became similar to areas of pristine habitat. See original paper for details of individual species responses to management. Reptiles were monitored in four sites (81 ha each) each managed by: prescribed burning (April–June 1995, 4 sites), using herbicides (May 1995, 4 sites) with burning (1997), or unburned and no herbicide until after 1999 when all sites were burned at 2–3-year intervals.
