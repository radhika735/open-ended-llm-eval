Results were not statistically tested. Known nesting sites where invasive vegetation was removed had 40% (2 out of 5 sites nested), 80% and 60% success over three breeding seasons following removal, compared to 40% nesting success before removal. Newly created nesting sites, where invasive vegetation was completely removed, had 33% (2 out of 6 sites nested), 33% and 67% success over three breeding seasons following removal, compared to 0% success before removal. Nesting success in sites where invasive vegetation was not removed was 100% (5 out of 5 sites nested), 60%, 40% and 40% over four breeding seasons. In 1993, sixteen nest sites were chosen: five known nesting sites where the invasive plant was present and manually removed from 1994; six sites newly created by manually clearing of all invasive vegetation and root stock (4 x 4 m area); and five where the invasive plant was present and was left untreated. In 1994–1997 (three breeding seasons) invasive vegetation clearing was carried out each season. In 1993–1997, all sites were monitored using foot, boat and aerial surveys in mid-December to determine use of nesting sites.</p>",

When non-native para grass was controlled, overall reptile and amphibian abundance was similar in grazed, burned, grazed and burned and unmanaged plots (results presented as statistical model outputs) but abundance of <em>Lampropholis delicata </em>was lower in all managed plots (burned: 3 skinks/plot; grazed: 4 skinks/plot; burned and grazed: 1 skink/plot) compared to unmanaged plots (14 skinks/plot). Para grass dominated habitat in a conservation park (3,245 ha) was divided into 12 plots (200 x 300 m each) and each plot was either burned, grazed, burned and grazed, or not managed (3 plots/management type). Burning took place in August 2004, September 2005 and November 2006. Cattle grazing took place after burning in September–December 2004, October–December 2005 and November–December 2006. Stocking levels were calculated to consume 50% of the grass biomass present/plot. Reptile and frog communities were sampled four times between 2005–2007 using three pitfall/funnel trap arrays/plot (see original paper for details). Reptiles were individually marked by toe clipping prior to release.</p>",
