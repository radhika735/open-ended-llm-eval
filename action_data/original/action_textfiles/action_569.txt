The first breeding in Louisiana was recorded in 1971, when the oldest released birds were three years old, and between 1971 and 1976 a total of 221 young fledged successfully. In 1975, an estimated 35–40% of the standing population of 400–450 pelicans died, probably as a consequence of contamination by endrin (an organochloride pesticide). Birds were provided with food twice daily after release.</p><p> </p>",

Nests produced an average of 1.7 nestlings between 1971 and 2001 (with a peak of 2.1 nestlings/nest in 2001), which, combined with pelicans’ long lifespans and a decline in the number of birds in Florida, leads the authors to suggest that the exponential growth of the Louisiana population may have been partly due to immigration from nearby states.</p><p> </p>",
