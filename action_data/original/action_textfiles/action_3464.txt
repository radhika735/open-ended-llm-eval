        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Small ridges and ledges’ are elevations with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 that protrude 1–50 mm from the substratum (modified from “Small elevations” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018). On vertical surfaces, vertically-orientated elevations that fit these criteria are referred to as ‘ridges’, while horizontal ones are referred to as ‘ledges’. On horizontal surfaces, these features are referred to as ‘ridges’ regardless of their orientation.</p>\r\n<p>Small ridges and ledges create vertical or horizontal (i.e. overhangs) relief in intertidal rocky habitats. They can provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide (Williams &amp; Morrit 1995) and also shelter from predation or grazing (Wahl &amp; Hoppe 2002). Some species preferentially recruit to habitats with high vertical or horizontal relief (Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al.</em> 1995). The size and density of ridges and ledges is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms and limit their growth. Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, horizontal ledges (overhangs) create shaded and downward-facing surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Ridges and ledges are sometimes present on quarried boulders used in marine artificial structures (MacArthur <em>et al.</em> 2020) but are often absent from other types of structures. Small ridges and ledges can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3466\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3462\"><em>Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3463\"><em>Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3465\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Dafforn K.A.

After 13 months, macroalgae and invertebrate species richness was higher on settlement plates with ridges, grooves, protrusions and pits than without at lowshore (13–23 vs 6–10 species/plate) and highshore (5–9 vs 2–3/plate). Richness was higher on plates with variable habitats than regular ones at lowshore (22–23 vs 13–16/plate), but not highshore (6–9 vs 5–6/plate).

In all other comparisons, results were similar (abundances: 104–1,957 vs 49–1,162/plate). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating ridges, grooves, protrusions or pits. However, richness was lower on plate quarters with ridges (6 species/plate) than pits (11/plate), but similar to quarters with protrusions and with grooves <em>and</em> ridges (both 8/plate). Abundances were similar for all habitat types (88–231 individuals/quarter). Settlement plates (400 × 400 mm) were moulded with and without small ridges, along with grooves, small protrusions and pits. Plates with added habitats were concrete. Each 200 × 200 mm quarter contained either 12 serrated ridges, four-to-five grooves and ridges, 36 protrusions or 36 pits.
