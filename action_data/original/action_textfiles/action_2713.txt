        "background_definitions": "<p>Pulse-equipped trawls are mainly beam trawls targeting flatfish (sole/plaice), but also shrimps. The tickler chains are replaced by electrodes that give off short electrical pulses, stunning the fish and raising them off the bottom and making them easier to catch (Polet <em>et al. </em>2005). It is a highly controversial method and is prohibited in the USA, China and several other countries. It is also technically illegal in EU waters. However, an exception to the rules allows countries to catch up to 5% of their annual fishing quota in the North Sea using \"innovative methods\" for research, and the use of pulse trawls predominantly occurs here. The Netherlands is the biggest user of this method and in 2018, there were around 80 trawlers holding permits issued by the Dutch government. Despite attempts to ban it altogether, pulse fishing is still ‘allowed’ in EU waters until mid-2021. Many fishers and opposers to the method believe it harms the fish it is designed to catch and kills other marine life (Polet <em>et al. </em>2005). However, there is evidence that suggests pulse-equipped trawls catch less unwanted marine life, including unwanted fish, than other trawlers (ICES 2020, Polet <em>et al. </em>2005) and cause less damage to the sea floor (ICES 2020). Furthermore, the body of research assessing the effects of pulse trawling has recently been extended (see references in ICES 2020) and is therefore not within the scope of the current synopsis.</p>\r\n<p>ICES.

Of 12 comparisons, catches of undersized commercial fish were lower in pulse trawls than in standard trawls for whiting <em>Merlangius merlangus </em>in four (58–69% lower), sole <em>Solea solea </em>in two (41–60%), plaice <em>Pleuronectes platessa</em> in five (40–80%) and dab <em>Limanda limanda </em>in two comparisons (61–65%). Lower catches in pulse trawls were also reported in non-commercial tub gurnard <em>Trigla lucerna </em>(one of three comparisons), pogge <em>Agonus cataphractus</em> (three of 12 comparisons), dragonet <em>Callionymus </em>spp. (two of 10 comparisons) and goby <em>Pomatoschistus </em>spp. (six of 12 comparisons). Catches of six other non-commercial species were similar in both trawl designs. Catches of legal-sized commercial fish were typically similar in pulse trawls and standard trawls, except for lower catches of flounder <em>Platichthys flesus</em> (29–37%) and dab (17%) in one and two of 12 comparisons respectively. In addition, undersized shrimp catches were reduced in 11 of 15 cases. In 2000, experimental fishing was undertaken on the Flemish Banks off the Belgian coast using two beam trawls simultaneously, a standard trawl and an experimental electric pulse trawl, with pulse generators fitted to the beam of the trawl in one of two array configurations. Fifty-seven hauls were completed with the experimental trawl being towed on one side of the vessel and the standard trawl on the other. Full details of trawl design and generator configurations are provided in the original study.</p>",

Fewer individuals of smaller sizes of the target species plaice and sole were caught in the pulse trawl than the beam trawl (data reported graphically). Data were collected in May 2011 from 126 trawl by three vessels fishing near each other. Two vessels used different types of pulse equipment (data pooled) and the other was a conventional tickler chain beam trawl (see original paper for specifications). Discarded catch was sampled from 33 hauls from each vessel.</p>",

Cod <em>Gadus morhua</em>, but not lesser-spotted dogfish <em>Scyliorhinus canicula</em>, suffered spinal fractures, other injuries and death at all sizes in one case and only at adult sizes in one case, when fish were close to electric fields (injuries 9–70%, death up to 30%).
