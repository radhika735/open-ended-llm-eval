Average inactivity time reduced from an average of 46% to 29% (wild loris averaged 43%) and average foraging time increased from 9% to 24% (wild loris averaged 27%). In addition, a significant increase in postures used in foraging in the wild and a wider behavioural repertoire was seen by recording positional behaviours. Observational data was collected over five consecutive days at five-minute intervals over six hours/day for each of the five animals for each of three conditions: pre-enrichment (usual diet); enrichment (usual diet plus live insects); and post-enrichment (usual diet). Approximately 200 crickets were scattered into an indoor enclosure at 10:00 h over the five days of the enrichment condition (approximately 40 each day) in addition to their normal diet.    (CJ)</p><p> </p>",
