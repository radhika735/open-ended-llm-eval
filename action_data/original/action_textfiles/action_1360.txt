In five other configurations, lettuces were smaller than in monoculture (38–44 vs 50 g/head).<strong> Methods:</strong> Eight plots (1 x 10 m) in each of four blocks were planted with a lettuce monoculture (control) or a combination of lettuce and alyssum (replacement or addition, in different configurations).</p><p> </p>",

Fifteen pots were buried 1.5 m from three field margins with one flower species (<em>Diplotaxis tenuifolia</em>), three margins with six flower species, or three unplanted margins (135 pots total).

The number of fruits/plant varied with the number of flower species/strip (three/strip: 35–140 fruits/plant; six/strip: 40–95; nine/strip: 35–50; bare ground: 30–55), as did fruit biomass (three/strip: 35–195 g dry biomass/fruit; six/strip: 35–70; nine/strip: 40–65; bare ground: 35–50), but not all differences were significant in both years (2011–2012), or both tomato varieties (Roma and Perfect Peel). <strong>Methods: </strong>Four treatments were compared: three flower species/strip (Apiaceae species), six species/strip (three Apiaceae and three Fabaceae), nine species/strip (three Apiaceae, three Fabaceae, and three others), and a control strip with no flowers. Three strips/treatment were sown with flower seeds (2011: 6 and 21 June; 2012: 13 and 17 June). Each flower strip (2 x 4 m) was positioned between two tomato plots (4 x 10 m/plot; one Roma plot and one Perfect Peel plot). Number of fruits/plant was assessed for five plants/plot and dry biomass was assessed for four fruits/plant.</p><p> </p>",
