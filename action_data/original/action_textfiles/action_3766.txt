Female McCann’s skinks exposed to basking temperatures for 3.5 days/week had lower gestation success (53% success) than skinks exposed to basking temperatures for 5 or 7 days/week (78–83% success). Similar numbers of female common geckos developed at least one viable offspring regardless of basking regime (3.5 days/week: 80% success; 5 days/week: 90% success; 7 days/week: 80% success). Most geckos that developed full-term embryos required inducement (see original paper for details). Clutch sizes were similar between different basking regimes for both skinks and geckos (see original paper for details). Pregnant female McCann’s skinks and common geckos were collected from the wild in November 2005 and October 2007 and kept in one of three basking regimes, with heat provided for: 8 hours/day for 3.5 days/week (17 skinks, 10 geckos), 5 days/week (18 skinks, 10 geckos) or 7 days/week (23 skinks, 10 geckos). Lizards were monitored until they gave birth and some lizards were induced when over-gestation was apparent using the hormone arginine vasotocin (see original paper for details). Gestation was considered a success when at least one viable offspring was delivered.</p>",

When mites were treated with vegetable oil, the majority of wild-caught pregnant female McCann’s skinks gave birth successfully (22 of 30 skinks completed pregnancy successfully, 2 of 30 skinks had partially successful pregnancies), whereas when mites were not treated, most pregnancies were not successful (1 of 17 skinks had a partially successful pregnancy). Female McCann’s skinks treated for mites produced more viable offspring (2.6 offspring/female), compared to when mites were not treated (0.1 offspring/female). Two weeks after initial treatment with oil, 14 of 30 female skinks showed signs of mites still being present. After 28 days (and two treatments of oil), no live mites were observed. In October 2004 and 2007, pregnant female McCann’s skinks were taken from the wild and maintained in controlled temperature and lighting conditions in individual containers (2004: 17 individuals; 2007: 30 individuals; see original paper for details). In 2004, all skinks had scale mites and were not treated. In 2007, all skinks were treated for mites using sunflower oil following capture. Skinks were checked for mites and retreated with oil as necessary on the 14th day (all skinks oiled), 28th day (only those skinks with raised scales were re-oiled) and 56th day (no skinks were re-oiled) following capture.</p>",
