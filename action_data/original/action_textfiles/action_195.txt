If nests are extremely likely to be destroyed during harvest or mowing then it may be best to remove the chicks and hand-rear them. Studies on the effects of this intervention are found in the chapter on captive breeding and hand-rearing.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The average harvest date of barley fields was later than for wheat or oat fields, but the small number of clutches (13) in barley fields made it impossible to assess the influence of nesting habitat on unmanaged clutch success.  The nature of the crop (wheat and/or oat vs. barley) did not influence breeding success in managed clutches.</p><p> </p>",
