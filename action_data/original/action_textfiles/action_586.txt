Many birds nest colonially for protection and are attracted nesting areas with conspecifics. Using realistic decoys may therefore encourage birds to colonise new areas. A similar intervention is ‘Use vocalisations to attract birds to safe areas’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Six decoys were placed (either singly or in pairs) in a 10 m circle at each study plot.
