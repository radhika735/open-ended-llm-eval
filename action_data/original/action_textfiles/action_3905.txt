For example, even when offered a food source, moths spend less time feeding in the presence of artificial light than when kept in complete darkness (van Langevelde <em>et al.</em> 2017). Attraction to artificial lights may also limit moths’ dispersal ability and mate-finding behaviour. Reducing the spillover of light through windows may minimize the impact of lights on moths living in urban areas (Gaston <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Gaston K.J., Davies T.W., Bennie J., Hopkins J.
