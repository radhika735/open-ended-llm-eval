Three species were significantly more abundant on set-aside and whilst six species showed a preference for non-set-aside fields, these preferences were not significant and the species (whitethroat Sylvia communis, goldcrest Regulus regulus, blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, stonechat Saxicola torquata, tree sparrow Passer montanus and treecreeper Certhia familiaris) were more likely to be selecting habitats based on field margins, rather than field management. Six species were associated with non-rotational set-aside; two with rotational set-aside; one with long-term grazed pasture set-aside and three with first year pasture set-aside.</p>",

These were skylarks Alauda arvensis (a field-nesting species) and linnets Carduelis cannabina (a boundary-nesting species). The study did not distinguish between set-aside, wildlife seed mixtures or overwinter stubble, classing all as interventions to provide seeds for farmland birds. This study describes several other interventions, discussed in the relevant section.</p>",

Early-sprayed set-aside had consistently lower densities of all species, compared to all land uses except winter-sown wheat. The site-level effects of set-aside and sowing crops in spring are discussed in ‘Sow crops in spring, not autumn’. This study also investigated the impact of reducing pesticide and fertiliser inputs.</p>",
