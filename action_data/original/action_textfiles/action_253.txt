Two adjacent ponds (45.0 x 27.2 m; 1.35 m depth) were used, with provided in one pond each year. Refuges were 12 mesh covered cages (2 x 2 x 1.2 m high) in two blocks of six, with shade cloth and containing 4-6 tree saplings to provide cover. At commencement of each trial, ponds were similarly stocked with freshwater fish. Fish weight was recorded at the beginning and end of each trial.</p><p> </p>",
