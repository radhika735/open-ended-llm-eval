Avocet distribution within impoundments was highest where water was 10-17 cm deep and 1-30% of the area was exposed; but lowest where there were high daily fluctuations in water depth. Water was slowly drawn down from impoundments from November to April, creating a wide range of water depths, before reflooding in June.</p><p> </p>",

Responses to water level (and associated vegetation) changes in ten adjacent prairie wetlands (150 x 300 m) created in 1980 were assessed. Censuses were conducted 1 May to 31 October (1980-1989). Yellow-headed blackbird <em>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus</em> used shallow-flooded areas with a mix of open water and emergent vegetation, red-winged blackbird <em>Agelaius phoeniceus</em> preferred denser vegetation. American coot <em>Fulica americana </em>preferred deep water with interspersed vegetation. Dabbling ducks generally occupied marsh with equal amounts of vegetation cover and open water. Diving ducks used deeper water but there was variation between species and season, as to whether open or more densely vegetated areas were preferred.</p><p> </p>",
