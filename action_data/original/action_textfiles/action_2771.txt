Using methods to trace the source of catches should provide the transparency and openness required to confirm and validate legal fish catches. This may deter or prevent illegal fishing if fishers know they may be caught if they try to land illegally caught fish. One such method is DNA testing that can differentiate fish populations of the same species from where they were caught. That means telling, for instance, the difference between Atlantic cod captured legally in the Eastern Baltic and cod caught illegally in the North Sea. Or it can mean identifying prohibited or endangered species such as sharks (Feitosa <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Feitosa L.M, Martins A.P.B, Giarrizzo T., Macedo M., Monteiro I.L, Gemaque R., Nunes J.L.S., Gomes F., Schneider H., Sampaio I., Souza R., Sales J.B., Rodrigues-Filho L.F., Tchaicka L. &amp; Carvalho-Costa L.F.
