Wild deer populations can cause damage to woodlands, crops and other wildlife habitats through browsing and bark stripping. The introduction of non-native deer species to the UK and a lack of predators to naturally control deer populations mean that management of deer numbers may be required to prevent damage to farmland habitats (Mayle 1999).</p>\r\n<p class=\"StyleSynopsisBodyTextItalic\">Mayle B.
