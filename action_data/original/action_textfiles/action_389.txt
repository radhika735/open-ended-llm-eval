Coyotes <em>Canis latrans</em> and ravens <em>Corvus corax</em> were controlled by poisoning and shooting. The main nest predators were coyotes (predating 17% of clutches in predator control years and 27% in non-control years), ravens (14% and 20%) and raccoons <em>Procyon lotor </em>(11% and 8%, the increase possibly related to a reduction in coyote numbers).</p><p> </p>",
