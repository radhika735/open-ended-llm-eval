In addition, between 1989 and 1991, several petrels were seen entangled and dying in <em>P. umbellifera </em>fruits every year. However, following the eradication of most of the population of <em>P. umbellifera</em> trees in 1992 and their failure to flower in 1993, no petrels were found dead due to entanglement in the 1992-3 or 1993-4 breeding seasons.
