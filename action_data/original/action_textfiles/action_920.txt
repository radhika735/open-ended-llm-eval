The average fish weight increased from 179 to 419g across all groups during the experiment. Three experimental diets containing the yeast were fed to groups of Atlantic salmon and included a heat killed dried yeast biomass containing 6% eicosapentaenoic acid and 20% oil. The yeast biomass was included at three dietary levels; 10%, 20% and 30% of the diet. Another group was fed a control diet containing fishmeal, wheat gluten, rapeseed oil and wheat meal. Fish were kept in tanks containing 50 fish under continuous light and fed with automatic feeders. Fish were counted and bulk weighed at the start of the experiment, and after 27 days, 56 days and 95 days of feeding the experimental diets.</p><p> </p>",
