Fish weighed an average of 105g at the start of the study and increased to 169.0g and 167.2 g in the fish meal and krill meal groups, respectively. Feed conversion ratios were 0.68 and 0.69, respectively. There was a difference in the composition and number of aerobic bacteria colonizing the hindgut of salmon between fish meal and krill meal diets (2.2 x 10<sup>6 </sup>and 8.5 x 10<sup>4</sup>,<sup> </sup>respectively). Salmon were fed either a diet containing fish meal as the protein source (58.9% of the diet) or a diet containing a 1:1 mix of fish meal and krill meal (64%) for 46 days. Three hundred salmon were stocked in 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> x 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> x 1m<sup>3</sup> fibreglass tanks for the duration of the experiment. On day 46, fish were anaesthetized and measured for weight and feed conversion.</p><p> </p>",
