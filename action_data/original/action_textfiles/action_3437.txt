        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Crevice habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 and depth &gt;50 mm (modified “Crevices” from Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Crevice habitats provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Williams &amp; Morritt 1995). They also provide shelter from predation or grazing (Menge &amp; Lubchenco 1981) and some species preferentially settle into them (Chabot &amp; Bourget 1988). The size and density of crevices is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small crevices can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large crevices can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, crevices contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Crevices sometimes form on artificial structures through erosion. However, these are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007) and are absent from many structures (Aguilera <em>et al.</em> 2014). Crevice habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3435\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3475\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3467\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3473\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3476\"><em>Create ‘rock pools’ on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3468\"><em>Create small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (≤100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3438\"><em>Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>;<a href=\"../../actions/3474\"><em> Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Aguilera M.A., Broitman B.R. &amp; Thiel M.
