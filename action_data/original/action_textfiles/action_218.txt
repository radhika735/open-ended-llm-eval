The study found that five red/amber-listed species of conservation concern (linnet <em>Carduelis cannabina</em>, bullfinch <em>Pyrrhula pyrrhula</em>, grey partridge <em>Perdix perdix</em>, house sparrow <em>Passer domesticus </em>and garden warbler <em>Sylvia borin</em>) appeared to be increasing in density within the Cotswolds Environmentally Sensitive Areas while declining nationally, suggesting that they benefit from some aspect of Environmentally Sensitive Areas management.  In each Environmentally Sensitive Areas, breeding birds were surveyed in May-August 2002, and results were compared with baseline survey information from 1992/3 (Exmoor) and 1997 (Cotswolds).  In the Cotswolds Environmentally Sensitive Area, birds were surveyed in 96 randomly-selected 1 km squares, while the majority (153km<sup>2</sup>) of the Exmoor Environmentally Sensitive Area was surveyed.</p><p> </p>",

Territories of breeding birds were mapped in 23 study areas, based on 3 visits between mid-April and mid-June. This study is also discussed in ‘Maintain traditional orchards’ and ‘Manage hedges to benefit wildlife (includes no spray, gap-filling and laying)’.</p><p> </p>",
