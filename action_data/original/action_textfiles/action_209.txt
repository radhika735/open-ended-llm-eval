Three native species (red-winged blackbird <em>Agelaius phoeniceus</em>, common grackle <em>Quiscalus quiscula</em> and vesper sparrow <em>Pooecetes gramineus</em>) nested in the fields, but that only one nest of forty (2.5%) successfully fledged young. Destruction by farming activities was the largest cause of nest mortality (39%) followed by predation (29%). Desertion only occurred at 5% of nests. Strips were 4.6 m wide and contained corn, soybeans and oats as well as mammoth red clover <em>Trifolium pratense</em>.</p><p> </p>",
