        "background_definitions": "<p>Harvesting timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height, or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to conventional clearcutting where all trees are felled. Reduced impact logging is a sustainable harvesting and management method that aims to minimize ecological disturbance. It involves selective logging as well as other practices such as mapping large target trees prior to felling, limiting the number of trees which can be felled/hectare, pre-cutting heavy vines and controlling the direction in which trees fall to minimize collateral damage, and planning the routes of access roads to reduce disturbance (Montejo-Kovacevich <em>et al.</em> 2018, Ribeiro &amp; Freitas 2012). The aim is to preserve the integrity of the forest structure, which may also be termed “continuous cover forestry” if the canopy remains intact.</p>\r\n<p>For other options for harvesting timber, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3868\"><em>Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3869\"><em>Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3870\"><em>Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3871\"><em>Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting</em></a>” and “<a href=\"../../actions/3872\"><em>Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest</em></a>”.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Montejo-Kovacevich G., Hethcoat M.G., Lim F.K.S., Marsh C.J., Bonfantti D., Peres C.A. &amp; Edwards D.P.

The abundance of exposed caterpillars (Geometridae and Noctuidae, which crawl on leaves while feeding) in selectively logged forests (2.3–3.5 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>) was higher than in clearcut forests (0.3–1.3 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>), and similar to undisturbed forests (3.0–5.7 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>). However, the abundance of concealed caterpillars (Tortricidae and Pyralidae, which spin leaves together and live between them) was not significantly different in selectively logged (0 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>), clearcut (0–0.3 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>) and undisturbed (0–1.3 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>) forests. Three forests were each divided into three 20-ha stands, which were randomly assigned to three treatments: selective logging (30% of trees and 45–50% of tree volume removed), clearcutting (all trees removed, followed by soil scarification and artificial regeneration), and undisturbed. Felling was staggered between winter 1987/88 and 1991/92. From late June–early July 1992, caterpillars feeding on bilberry were counted in three randomly placed 0.1-m<sup>2</sup> plots in each of 10 sites within each stand.</p>",

One year after harvesting, there was no significant difference in the number of moth species between stands subjected to single-tree harvesting (39 species), group-selection harvesting (40 species) or shelterwood harvesting and clearcutting (46 species, data not separated), but all harvested stands had fewer species than unharvested stands (56 species). One year before harvesting, all stands had a similar number of moth species (single-tree: 85; group-selection: 100; shelterwood/clearcutting: 96; unharvested: 90 species). In 2008, forest stands (3–5 ha, 150–350 m apart) in three watersheds (500 ha, 10 km apart) were logged. In one watershed, four stands had random single trees removed, and four stands were harvested by group-selection (80% of trees removed). In a second watershed, three stands were shelterwood harvested (15% of trees removed), two stands were clearcut (100% of trees removed), and three stands were unharvested (no trees removed). In the third watershed, all four stands were unharvested. All stands had been clearcut around 60 years earlier.
