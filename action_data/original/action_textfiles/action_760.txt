Almost 6,000 amphibians were swabbed for the disease. The secondary aim of the project had been to raise awareness of amphibians, the threat of the disease and the biosecurity measures that should be taken when visiting breeding ponds. Field work was largely carried out by volunteers, who were recruited and trained through voluntary county groups known as Amphibian and Reptile Groups. Ponds were visited to sample amphibians by skin swabbing (30/pond) in spring and summer.</p><p> </p>",

The project was run by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, following standardized protocols that had been used since 1998. The project encouraged individuals and communities to learn about wetlands and help conserve amphibians by training volunteers to listen and report breeding calls of frogs and toads in local wetlands. Host institution coordinators were trained and then recruited, trained and supported local groups of volunteers. All resources and materials were available on the website. Data were used to help develop practical strategies for conservation.</p><p> </p>",

Numbers of records submitted by each volunteer varied from one to 4,452. Seventy-four people submitted 10 or more records. Distribution data were submitted for 32 frog and 51 salamander species, several of which were considered priority species in Carolina. Members of the public registered on the website to contribute data to the online database. Data were archived and distributed to a large online audience (registered and non-registered). Participants were initially recruited by contacting local and state wildlife managers, birding clubs, schools and other potentially interested groups. The project was advertised in wildlife-related publications and magazines and at scientific meetings in North and South Carolina.</p><p> </p>",

The project was coordinated by Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, the Amphibian and Reptile Groups of the UK and other partners including Statutory Agencies. Volunteers were trained in species identification, survey methodologies and bio-security. They then monitored ponds within randomly selected 1 km grid squares across the UK. Ponds were sampled during 1–4 annual visits in 2007–2012. Surveys involved visual and torch searches, netting and sometimes bottle trapping (only by experienced surveyors).
