        "background_definitions": "<p>Reptile nests may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an organised ‘hatchery’. Hatcheries consist of a defined location on or near the nesting beach, well above the high tide line, that is often fenced and patrolled. Nests/eggs collected from the beach are then reburied within the hatchery, where they can be closely monitored.</p>\r\n<p>Burying a potentially large number of nests/eggs within a relatively small area may present a number of risks, and the consequences of disturbances such as flooding or poaching could be particularly severe. Other environmental variables at the hatchery location (e.g. temperature and humidity) may also impact on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of the hatchlings (Warner &amp; Andrews 2002, Booth <em>et al</em>. 2006), and should be carefully considered when selecting the location.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.
