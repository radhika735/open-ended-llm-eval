To attempt to regulate fishing activity in an area, permits/licences or charters may be implemented that represent an agreement between the fishers and fisheries managers. To be authorized to fish, each fisher must abide by the rules stipulated by the permit or charter. This may include measures such as communicating details of their catches and setting limits on fishing periods and/or how much gear can be fished. Fishing effort may be able to be controlled so that the effects of over-fishing are avoided (Cadiou <em>et al</em>. 2009). Compliance and enforcement of illegal activity may also be improved.</p>\r\n<p>Cadiou G., Boudouresque C.F., Bonhomme P. &amp; Direach L.L.
