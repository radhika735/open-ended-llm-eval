Of the 47 translocation projects reviewed (39 species), 32% were successful, 28% failed and long-term success was uncertain for the remaining 40%. Projects that translocated animals due to human-wildlife conflicts failed more often (63% of 8 projects) than those for conservation purposes (15% of 38) and those for research purposes (50% of 5). Success was independent of the life-stage translocated/released, number of animals released and geographic region (see paper for details). Releases of captive-bred animals made up 7% of the projects, and individuals involved were adults in 75% of cases, juveniles and sub-adults in 64% of cases and eggs in 4% of cases. The most common reported cause of failure was homing and migration with the second most common reported cause being insufficient numbers, human collection and food/nutrient limitation all equally reported. Success was defined as evidence of substantial recruitment to the adult population during monitoring over a period at least as long as it takes the species to reach maturity.</p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p>A study in 2012–2013 in regenerating temperate forest in South Island, New Zealand (Jarvie <em>et al. </em>2015) found that most released captive-reared tuatara <em>Sphenodon punctatus</em> survived at least 9 months after being released into a predator-free fenced enclosure with artificial burrows. After 3–5 months, all tuatara captive-reared locally (100%) and almost all tuatara captive-reared to the north of the release site (96%) survived. After 9–11 months, survival rates of tuatara reared north of the release site (70%) were higher than and locally-reared and released tuatara (67%, results were not statistically tested). Growth rates of locally-reared tuatara (0.05 mm/day) were faster than those reared away from the release site (0.04 mm/day). Changes in body condition, post-release dispersal and home range sizes were similar between locally-reared and distant-reared tuatara (see original paper for details). Juvenile tuatara (41 individuals) originating from the same wild population were released into a reserve in November–December 2012: captive-reared locally to the release site (13 individuals), and captive-reared 480 km north of the release site in a warmer climate (28 individuals). Captive-reared tuatara were hatched from artificially incubated eggs and reared until 4–6 years old. The reserve was surrounded by predator-resistant fencing and mammalian predators were mostly eradicated by 2008. Artificial burrows were buried in the release area. Tuatara were monitored by radio-tracking for 5 months (6 locally-reared, 10 north-reared individuals) and recapture surveys (all tuatara were PIT tagged) for up to 27 months after release.</p>",
