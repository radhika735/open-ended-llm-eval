It is also highly influenced by environmental conditions like water temperature and salinity, among others, and may change over short timescales, such as different times of the day. Different fishing gears exploit the known depth distributions of fish and are deployed either on the seabed or at specific depths in the water column to maximise catches of the desired fish (aided by sonar technology in many cases). Conversely, this knowledge may also be used to avoid the capture of fish, potentially rare or threatened species and commercial unwanted species or sizes.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under <em>‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - <a href=\"../../actions/2684\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species</a>’ and <a href=\"../../actions/2685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution’</a>.</em></p>",

Catch rates of five out of 17 unwanted species were lower on sets using deeper longlines compared to shallower longlines: wahoo <em>Acanthocybium solandri </em>(0.4 vs 1.2 fish/set), dolphinfish <em>Coryphaena hippurus </em>(1.3 vs 3.8 fish/set), blue marlin <em>Makaira nigricans </em>(0.1 vs 0.4 fish/set), striped marlin <em>Kajikia audax</em> (0.5 vs 1.5 fish/set) and shortbill spearfish <em>Tetrapturus angustirostris </em>(0.1 vs 0.6 fish/set). Catch rates of most other unwanted fish (11 out of 17 species – see paper for species individual data) were similar between longline depths, including the target commercial species bigeye tuna <em>Thunnus obesus</em> (5.7 vs 4.7 fish/set). One unwanted species, sickle pomfret <em>Taractichthys steindachneri</em>, was caught more frequently with deeper longlines (3.5 fish/set) than shallower longlines (2.0 fish/set). A total of 90 longline sets (2,000 hooks/set) were deployed from a vessel fishing out of Honolulu, Hawaii, in June-December 2006. Forty-five sets were modified using 3 kg weighted lines to keep all hooks at depths of 103 m at either end to 248 m in the middle. The other 45 were conventional sets with hooks at depths between 44–211 m. The vessel used deeper and shallower sets on alternate days.</p>",

Data were not statistically tested. At 100–400 m depths, semi-floating traps caught 18 unwanted species of fish at catch rates between &lt;0.1–858.9 g/trap/day, and bottom traps caught eight species at &lt;0.1–24.9 g/trap/day. Between 401–800 m depth, semi-floating traps caught eight unwanted fish species (&lt;0.1–2,241.0 g/trap/day) while bottom traps caught four species (0.4–140.6 g/trap/day). At the deepest depths (801–1,130 m), semi-floating traps caught five unwanted fish species (&lt;0.1–186.4 g/trap/day) and four were caught in bottom traps (0.5–41.9 g/trap/day). At all but the deepest depths, conger eels <em>Conger conger</em> accounted for a large proportion of the unwanted catch in bottom traps and in semi-floating traps at the intermediate depths (see paper for species individual data). Target shrimp <em>Plesionika </em>spp. catches between floating and bottom traps varied with species and depth (see paper for data). Four research surveys were done around the Canary Islands in 2003–2004 at depths of 100–1,300 m. Two types of traps were used to target shrimp: semi-floating traps of plastic mesh (20 ×15 mm) covering a conical cylinder (56 × 57 cm), and bottom traps made of wire mesh (19 × 19 mm) and an iron rectangular frame (100 × 100 × 50 cm). Semi-floated traps were set in groups of 75 traps, 15 m apart and 2 m above the seabed (total 1,971). Bottom traps were deployed in lines of 10 traps, 50 m apart (total 487). All traps were deployed in daylight hours and baited with mackerel <em>Scomber colias</em>.</p>",

Hydraulically powered handlines with 18 hooks each were deployed during 10 vessel trips 4–5 days long during the day in mid-water (280–550 m) and deep-water (550–830 m), and at night in mid-water. In ‘non-dogfish habitat’ 1,036 handline deployments were carried out and 407 deployments were in ‘dogfish habitat’. Handlines were deployed at randomly selected positions and hauled after 5–10 minutes or until it was felt several fish had been hooked. Details of when the study took place were not reported.
