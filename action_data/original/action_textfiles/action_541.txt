This chick will always be weaker and is almost always killed by its siblings or starves to death as it cannot compete for food. It is thought that this chick acts as ‘insurance’ in case the older chicks die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">In very rare species, it may be beneficial to ‘rescue’ the younger chick, but doing so can be difficult. It is possible that providing extra food will allow the yonger chick to survive for long enough for a rescue attempt to be mounted.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

In a third supplemented nest (in 2008), the second-hatched chick survived for five days and was removed to be hand-reared and incorporated into a captive-breeding programme. Supplementary food consisted of 2-3 kg of dead rabbits within 100 m of the nests every two days from the hatching of the first chick until the death (or removal) of the second chick. The partially-supplemented nest was provided with food on just one day.</p><p> </p>",
