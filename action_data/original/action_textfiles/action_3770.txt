After one year, 24 of 32 (75%) released alligator snapping turtles were still alive. Two turtles were lost within 45 days of release and a further six turtles were lost by the beginning of the second year in the wild (see original paper for details). Captive-bred juveniles dispersed similar distances after release (765 m) as released subadults from turtle farms (769 m), but had smaller home ranges (captive-bred: 730 m; turtle farm: 1,789 m). In June 2007, sixteen captive-bred juvenile turtles (bred and reared in the Tishomingo National Fish Hatchery; born in 2002 or 2004) were radio-tagged and released into a single site (a river reach adjacent to the Washita River). In 2006, sixteen subadult alligator snapping turtles recovered from a turtle farm were radio-tagged and released at the same location. A further 250 turtles from the turtle farm were released at six locations in 2007 (monitoring data not provided).  Turtles were monitored weekly during the summer months in 2007 and 2008.</p>",

At least 40 of 246 turtles (actual number not given) were recaptured at least once 1–4 years after release, and overall annual survival was estimated at 59%. Turtles that were older at their time of release were estimated to have higher annual survival than younger turtles (5 years old: 100%; 4 years old: 70%; 3 years old: 59%). Recaptured turtles all showed increases their shell size compared to when released (average of 7–29% growth/year). Body condition of released turtles was similar to that of turtles that remained in captivity (reported as statistical model output). In 2008–2010, a total of 246 turtles were released into two rivers. Turtles were captive-bred and raised in captivity for 3–7 years. Annual trapping was carried out in 2008–2012 during May–August for 60–189 trap nights/year. Size of recaptured turtles (number not given) was compared to 224 still in captivity.</p>",

Ten of 12 (83%) nine-month-old captive-bred European pond turtles survived at least two years in the wild. Five years after the first releases, the first female turtle was confirmed to be carrying eggs. Authors reported that the two turtles that died in the first year after release were probably predated by terrestrial mammals. In September 2003 (eight individuals) and 2005 (four individuals) hatchling European pond turtles born in captivity (sourced from a private breeder) were reared in a terrarium for eight months. In May 2004 and 2006, juvenile turtles were moved to a predator-proof acclimatisation cage (1 x 2 m) for one month prior to release into a fenced pond inside a fenced 1 ha wetland complex in a regional park (see original paper for details). A resident population of largemouth bass <em>Micropterus salmoides </em>was controlled prior to release by catching with pole and line. Larger fish predators were excluded from shallow waters in the release pond using fences woven from branches. A sand and dirt nesting area (2.5 m high x 15 m long) was created in the release area.</p>",
