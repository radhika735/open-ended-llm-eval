Canopy cover in the buffered forest edge (approx. 90%) was higher than that along the edge with no planted buffer (approx. 75%). Similarly, stem density along the buffered edge (approx. 4 trees/m<sup>2</sup>) was lower than along the unbuffered edge (approx. 14 trees/m<sup>2</sup>). However, there was no difference in species richness of the understory between the buffered (approx. 1.3 species/m<sup>2</sup>) and unbuffered edge (approx. 2.4 species/m<sup>2</sup>). The 30 m wide buffer had been planted 14 years earlier and consisted of 80 different plant species planted 1.8 m apart. The surrounding area consisted of pastures and maintained lawns. The vegetation at each forest edge was sampled using ten 40 m transects, perpendicular to the buffer and the unbuffered forest edge respectively. Each transect contained ten quadrats (1 × 1 m).</p><p class=\"Synopsisbodytext\"> </p>",
