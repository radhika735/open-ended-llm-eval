The captive population had high hatching success (78–100% for 50 eggs shipped to Patuxent Wildlife Research Centre in 1967-74, and 77% for 166 eggs shipped to Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in 1975-88) but ‘downy young’ suffered 68% mortality, mainly due to disease and anatomical abnormalities. However, cranes first bred in captivity in 1975 (in Patuxent), with five females laying 19 eggs in 1989 (nine hatching). This study is also discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’, ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering)’.</p><p> </p>",
