Species richness (control: 24; herbicide: 17) and diversity (Simpson's index control: 0.83; herbicide: 0.35) were lower in treated plots. Data were collected in 2006 in two plots (30 × 85 m) of each control and herbicide (annual herbicide applications) treatments in each of four blocks that had been clearcut in 1999. In all plots tree trunks were removed and Douglas-fir <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em> seedlings were planted in 2000.</p><p> </p>",
