Between four and 721 larvae were counted per site in 2001 and 4,000–5,000 were counted at one site in 2002. Two of the three populations failed because of predation by viperine snakes <em>Natrix maura.</em> From 1985, captive breeding was undertaken by a number of national and international centres. Adults (0–387/site) and larvae (0–227) were released at 15 sites over one to nine years in 1985–1997. Populations were surveyed in 2001.</p><p> </p>",

There was no significant difference in morphological responses to predators in a population that had been captive-bred for 3–8 generations and released in a predator-free pond and the ancestral natural population. Tail length, lower tail fin shape and development did not differ. In terms of genetic diversity, although heterozygosity was similar between populations, the reintroduced population had lower allelic richness. Forty-eight tadpoles from the natural and reintroduced population (with the same ancestry) were captured. Treatments were: chemical cues from viperine snakes <em>Natrix maura </em>or green frogs <em>Rana perezi</em><em> </em>or a control. Tadpoles were measured each 15 days. DNA was analysed.<em> </em></p><p> </p>",
