This is particularly the case if the fish are invasive species, often introduced for fishing. For example, a systematic review found that evidence indicates that newts, salamanders and some frog species are less likely to be found in water bodies stocked with salmonids, such as salmon and trout than those with no stocking (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is a large amount of literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling fish by catching, which may be undertaken specifically for the conservation of amphibian species (e.g. Knapp <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Knapp R.A. &amp; Matthews K.R.

One of the ponds was colonized by adults two years after fish and eels were removed, but breeding was not recorded. Only one male was seen in one of the ponds that was enlarged and had fish removed. Fish or eels were reintroduced to ponds within 1–2 years. In winter (1986–1993), fish were removed from six ponds (three twice). Seven ponds had fish removed and were enlarged. Ponds were monitored by call and torch surveys and by counting tadpoles and metamorphs during 4–6 visits in April–September.</p><p> </p>",

At one site, there was no significant increase in great crested newt numbers in the three years following fish removal, which the authors considered to have been only partially effective. At the second site, although great crested newt adults and eggs were recorded following fish control, no larvae were seen. Over 2,000 sticklebacks were removed from the pond, but they were observed again a few years after treatment. Electro-fishing and treatment with rotenone were undertaken at a forest pond in 1996. At the other site, a pond (600 m<sup>2</sup>) was netted twice to remove trout in autumn 1997. Great crested newts were surveyed at that site in 1992–2000.</p><p> </p>",

Numbers increased to similar to those in the existing fishless lake (egg masses 65–165/150 m; larvae: 57–114/150 m). Night surveys showed a similar pattern with larvae increasing from 72 to 172/150 m and becoming similar to the fishless lake (50–145/150 m). Trout were removed from June to September 1993–2002 using gill nets (42 m long, 2 m tall). One to four nets were set once to several times during a field season. Salamanders were monitored using snorkel surveys along 25 m transects (four nearshore and two offshore) once or twice annually from July to September. Five night and 17–18 day larvae/neotene surveys and 10 egg mass surveys were completed per lake.</p><p> </p>",

Within 1–3 years of starting fish control, frogs were detected in three lakes where they were previously absent (frogs: 3–67; tadpoles: 0). Complete eradication of fish was achieved from three lakes within 3–4 years, in the other three small numbers remained because of connecting streams. Non-native trout (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>sp.,<em> Salmo </em>sp.,<em> Salvelinus </em>sp.) were removed using 3–13 sinking gill nets (36 m long x 1.8 m high) set continuously in each lake. Netting was continued until catch rates fell to zero for an entire summer. Fish were eliminated from connecting streams when they dried out, using gill nets and electro-fishing.
