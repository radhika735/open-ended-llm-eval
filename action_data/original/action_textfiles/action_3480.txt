        "background_definitions": "<p>Development activity may be accompanied by a biodiversity ‘offsetting’ strategy that aims to compensate for the loss of existing habitat and associated species by protecting other sites or creating new sites of equal value to the lost habitat (e.g. Bull <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ives &amp; Bekessy 2015). Offsetting may be ‘in-kind’, whereby new habitat is similar to that lost (for example creating ponds to replace ponds lost elsewhere), or ‘out-of-kind', whereby the new habitat is different (for example creating rock outcrops to replace lost grasslands elsewhere). Existing green spaces such as golf courses — known to support substantial wildlife numbers, especially urban-adapted species (Hodgkison <em>et al</em>. 2007) — have been proposed as potential sites for biodiversity offsets (Burgin &amp; Wotherspoon 2009). Studies describing habitat restoration that is not compensatory for urban development or is carried out retrospectively rather than planned alongside the development, are summarized under <em>Habitat restoration and creation</em>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Bull J.W., Gordon A., Law E.A., Suttle K.B. &amp; Milner‐Gulland E.J.
