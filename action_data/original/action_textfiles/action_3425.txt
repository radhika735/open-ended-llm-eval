        "background_definitions": "<p>Mulch is organic material, such as leaves or bark, which is spread over soil with the aim of improving germination and survival of target plants. Mulch may increase soil water availability, thereby aiding plant germination (Donath <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2007) as well as protecting against erosion. However, thick mulch layers may also prevent the germination of seeds that respond to changes in light and temperature, and survival of seedlings that are shaded by mulch (Facelli &amp; Pickett 1991, Suding &amp; Goldberg 1999).</p>\r\n<p>The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding mulch before or after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an unmulched but seeded or planted plot).

In 11 of 13 comparisons, after 6–7 months, the density of six plant species did not differ significantly between mulched and seeded areas (0–27 plants/m<sup>2</sup>) and unmulched and seeded areas (0–18 plants/m<sup>2</sup>).

Six plots were covered with 10 cm of mulch (a locally produced composted yard waste), and six plots were left untreated. The landfill site had been decommissioned in 1966 and sown with grass in 1971. All surviving plants were measured in June and September 1995, and in July 1996 and 1997. Measurements included height, diameter, area, spread, and/or branch and stem length depending on the plant species.</p>",

After one year, plots that were mulched and seeded had on average a greater cover of target plant species (67–70%) than plots that were unmulched and seeded (25–33%). However, the average number of target plant species was similar between mulched (7–23 species) and unmulched plots (6–22 species). In December 2004, three blocks were established on an unvegetated area (240 x 50 m) of boulder clay mixed with sand. In each block, two plots had a layer of mulch added (3–5 cm thick), and two plots were left unmulched. Mulch was obtained from a second cut of species-poor grassland. One of each of the two mulched and unmulched plots/block was sown with a high diversity mix of local seeds, and the other with a low diversity mix of non-local seeds. Vegetation was monitored within a 5-m<sup>2</sup> quadrat in each plot in 2005.</p>",
