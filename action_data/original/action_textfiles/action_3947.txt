        "background_definitions": "<p>Heathland, like other open habitats, requires some disturbance to maintain habitat favourable to specialist species of butterflies and moths. Management by cutting is one option for creating this disturbance, but cutting causes a sudden change in the habitat structure, potentially removing nectar resources or injuring or killing eggs, caterpillars or pupae living within the heath (Humbert et al. 2010, Morris 2000). Therefore, the timing and frequency of cutting may be important for avoiding these short-term negative impacts on butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). This action includes studies comparing different cutting regimes, as well as studies comparing cutting to other options for heathland management, such as burning.</p>\r\n<p>For studies on the creation or restoration of heathland or shrubland by either <em>multiple actions</em> (which may include cutting) or where the <em>specific action is not clear</em>, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3946\"><em>Restore or create heathland/shrubland</em></a>”. For studies on other actions for heathland and shrubland management and restoration, see “<a href=\"../../actions/3933\"><em>Replant native vegetation</em></a>”, “<a href=\"../../actions/3944\"><em>Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen)</em></a>” and “<em>Natural system modifications – <a href=\"../../actions/3882\">Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats</a></em>”.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Humbert J.Y., Ghazoul J., Sauter G.J. &amp; Walter T.

In the first three years after cutting commenced, the abundance of frosted elfin <em>Callophrys irus</em> (1.3 individuals/hour), Olympia marble <em>Euchloe olympia</em> (18 individuals/hour), Karner blue <em>Lycaeides melissa samuelis</em> (120 individuals/hour), Persius duskywing <em>Erynnis persius</em> (1.8 individuals/hour), and dusted skipper <em>Atrytonopsis hianna</em> (1 individual/hour) were all similar to under the previous burning regime (frosted elfin: 0; Olympia marble: 6; Karner blue: 135; Persius duskywing: 0.7; dusted skipper: 0 individuals/hour). In April 1988 and 1991, an area of pine barren was burned. In April 1994, the area was not burned, and unintensive cutting management commenced. Between 1988–1996, butterflies were surveyed along a transect at the site multiple times/year (no further details provided).</p>",

Over 13 years, in an area managed by cutting, Karner blue abundance (28–32 individuals/year) was higher than in areas managed by rotational burning (9–11 individuals/year) or rotational burning and cutting (8–10 individuals/year). An unburned refuge supported a similar abundance of Karner blue (11–14 individuals/year). Within a 12,180-ha pine barren, six areas with a similar abundance of wild lupine <em>Lupinus perennis </em>were compared. One area was managed by mechanical cutting, one was managed with cool-season rotational burning, three were managed by burning and cutting, and one area was left as a 14-ha unburned refuge (last burned in 1988).

Results were not tested for statistical significance. In 2002, prior to scrub control, an average of seven high brown fritillary adults/hour were recorded at the site, and seven years after scrub clearance began, 14 adults/hour were recorded. Small pearl-bordered fritillary also increased in number between 2003 and 2011 (numbers not given).
