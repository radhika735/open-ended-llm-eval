Modified trap-nets had a wire grid (1.2 x 0.8 m with 2 mm wires spaced 175 mm apart) in the funnel of the trap and a fish bag made from Dyneema netting. Conventional trap-nets had an open funnel and fish bags made from elastic nylon (salmon trap-nets) or stiff polyethylene (whitefish trap-nets).

One design of modified trap-net (a ‘pontoon’ trap) had a significantly lower average proportion of seal-damaged salmon/haul (1%) than two types of traditional trap-net (30%), and total catch rates were similar (modified trap-nets: 2.3 fish/haul; traditional trap-nets: 1.9–2.4 fish/haul).

Results are not based on assessments of statistical significance. Fewer sea lion pups successfully entered pots with steel rods fitted (0–45%) than pots without (82%). More sea lion pups were excluded from pots with a smaller gap between the rod and pot opening (60 mm gap: 55% of pups excluded; 40 mm gap: 72%; 20 mm gap: 95%; 0 mm gap: 100%). Daily catch rates of target rock lobster <em>Panulirus cygnus</em> did not differ significantly between pots with or without steel rods (see original paper for data). A lobster pot with a steel rod and a control pot (without a steel rod) were filled with 10–15 lobsters and deployed in shallow water adjacent to a sea lion breeding colony. The height of the steel rod was varied to create four gap sizes at the pot opening (0, 20, 40 or 60 mm). Trials were carried out for each of the four pot treatments until all lobsters were removed or sea lions moved away from the area (dates not reported). Sea lion pups that placed their head into the pot (at risk of drowning) were counted as entering pots.</p>",

A modified salmon bag-net and a conventional bag-net were deployed 250 m apart at a bay and a harbour. Modifications to the bag-net prevented seals from entering the inner chamber and trapping fish (e.g. rope-framed entrance replaced with rigid steel bars, heavier net material, a reduced mesh size in the net floor, tight corners inside the chamber closed off).

Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (highly effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the conservation of marine and freshwater mammal species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the increase in numbers of a population following the introduction of a specific intervention, the reduction in mortality or the establishment of a new population following translocation. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an increase in the conservation of marine and freshwater mammals. </p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any undesirable effects for marine and freshwater mammal species as a consequence of these interventions. Harms on other species groups are not included as we did not search the literature specifically for this purpose. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. </p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores.
