        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">The American bullfrog <em>Rana catesbeiana </em>has been introduced to many parts of the world. The species is relatively large and adaptable and has significant effects on some native species through competition for resources and predation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is additional literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling bullfrogs, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Banks <em>et al.</em> 2000; Orchard 2011; Louette 2012). For example, one modelling study found that culling bullfrog metamorphs in autumn was the most effective method of decreasing population growth rate (Govindarajulu <em>et al</em>. 2005). A review suggested that an indirect approach, by managing habitat rather than directly controlling bullfrogs, may be a more effective way to reduce the effects of bullfrogs on native amphibians (Adams &amp; Pearl 2007). <span>For the success of control of American bullfrogs </span><span>see the </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../data/index?synopsis_id%5B%5D=18&amp;terms=bullfrogs&amp;country%5B%5D=&amp;r=data&amp;result_type=interventions#search-results\">Control of Freshwater Invasive Species synopsis</a></span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Adams M.J. &amp; Pearl C.A.

Counts increased from eight to 11 frogs in removal ponds. Numbers did not change in control ponds. Adult frogs were less visible when bullfrogs were present. Frogs used willows significantly less as cover, and were found on bare shores twice as much when adult bullfrogs were absent. Invasive American bullfrogs were removed from 12 ponds in 2004–2007. They were captured by hand, Hawaiian slings (spears) and seine netting (for tadpoles). Six ponds without bullfrogs in an adjacent field were monitored for comparison. Amphibians were monitored three times each week until October 2007.</p><p> </p>",

Surveys in 2010–2011 showed that chiricahua leopard frogs had dispersed into eight and lowland leopard frogs into three sites that had previously been unsuitable due to presence of bullfrogs. Chiricahua leopard frogs dispersed over 8 km to a site further north than it had recently been documented in the region. Bullfrogs were eradicated between 2008 and 2010.</p><p> </p>",
