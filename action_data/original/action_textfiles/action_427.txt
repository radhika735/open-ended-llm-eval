Overall, 68% of experimental flicker sites lost a total of 42 cavity-nests to starlings in spite of the presence of a nearby flicker nest box, and nine of these pairs lost two or more cavities to starlings. Flicker pairs with starlings fledged significantly less young than pairs without starlings (20% compared to 36% respectively). Flicker pairs without starlings produced significantly larger clutches than pairs with starlings (7.4 compared to 5.4 eggs / nest). Only one flicker pair nested in a nest box rather than a nest cavity. Nest boxes were installed within 0.5-2.0 m of all flicker cavities. Starlings were present in experimental but not control sites.</p><p> </p>",
