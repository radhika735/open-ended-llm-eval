        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Groove habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 and depth 1–50 mm (modified from “Crevices” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Groove habitats provide organisms refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Nelson &amp; Vance 1979). Some species preferentially settle into them (Bourget <em>et al.</em> 1994). The size and density of grooves is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small grooves can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large grooves can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms.</p>\r\n<p>Grooves are sometimes present on artificial structures such as cable mattresses (Lacey &amp; Hayes 2020) or quarried boulders (MacArthur <em>et al.</em> 2020). They can also form on structures through erosion, but will often be filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007), and are absent from many structures. Groove habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating groove habitats on artificial reefs and on substrates for coral rearing or gardening (e.g. Douke <em>et al.</em> 1998; Rani <em>et al.</em> 2015). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3449\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3455\"><em>Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3434\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3454\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Bourget E., DeGuise J. &amp; Daigle G.

Data were not statistically tested. After 42 months, there were 55 kelp individuals on the surface with large grooves (wet weight: 0.93 kg), 32 on the surface with small grooves (0.48 kg) and 20 on the surface without grooves (0.31 kg). Three canopy algae species had similar abundances and weights on the surface with large grooves (5–10 individuals, all 0.01 kg), small grooves (2–19 individuals, 0.01–0.04 kg) and without grooves (3–18 individuals, 0.05–0.17 kg). Groove habitats were created on a concrete breakwater block (2.3 × 2.3 × 0.8 m). There was one array of five large grooves (length: 644 mm; width: 46 mm; depth: 23 mm) and one of nine small grooves (length: 644 mm; width: 3 mm; depth not reported), evenly-spaced on 644 × 529 mm horizontal surfaces. One adjacent surface had no grooves. Small grooves were created by scraping using a nail (method for large grooves not reported). The block was placed on sandy seabed at 9 m depth in November 1985. Macroalgae on surfaces with and without grooves were counted and weighed (wet weight) after 42 months.</p>",

After 24 months, the macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity was higher on blocks with added habitats than without (data reported as Shannon index) and the community composition differed (data reported as statistical model results). Thirty species (7 mobile invertebrates, 14 non-mobile invertebrates, 9 fishes) recorded on and around blocks with added habitats were absent from blocks without. Species abundances varied on blocks with and without added habitats depending on the species group (see paper for results). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating grooves, holes, pits, or using environmentally-sensitive material. Groove habitats were created on breakwater blocks (1 × 1 × 1 m) using a formliner. Each block had multiple irregular grooves (length: 100–600 mm; width: 5–15 mm; depth: 10 mm; T. Hadary <em>pers. comms.</em>) amongst multiple holes and pits (number/spacing not reported). Five blocks of each of three patented ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> materials (lower pH and different cement/additives to standard-concrete) were placed at 5–7 m depth on a concrete-block breakwater during construction in July 2012. Five standard-concrete blocks (1.7 × 1.7 × 1.7 m) without added habitats were placed on a similar breakwater 80 m away. Macroalgae and invertebrates on blocks, and fishes on and around blocks, were counted over 24 months.</p>",
