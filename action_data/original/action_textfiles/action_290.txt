This can delay the sinking of the line and baits, increasing the time available for birds to get hooked. A line shooter works by deploying the line faster than the boat is moving, removing tension from it and allowing the line to sink faster.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Treatment had no effect on the number of birds following vessels, or the attack rate on baits. A total of 156 line sets were studied, set for Pacific cod <em>Gadus macrocephalus</em> and walleye pollock <em>Theragra chalcogramma</em> southeast of the Pribilof Islands, USA. This study is also discussed in ‘Weight baits or lines to reduce longline bycatch of seabirds’, ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines‘, ‘Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch’ and ‘Set lines underwater to reduce seabird bycatch’.</p><p> </p>",
