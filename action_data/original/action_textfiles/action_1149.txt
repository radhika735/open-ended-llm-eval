Plots treated with insecticide had greater seedling emergence (approx. 13 seedlings/plot) than untreated plots (approx. 9 seedlings/plot). Additionally, seedling mortality was lower in plots treated with insecticide (approx. 3 %) than in untreated plots (approx. 7%). Sixteen plots (0.8 × 1 m) were treated with Carbaril dust 5%, dosed at 5 g active ingredient/m<sup>2</sup>. The other 16 plots were not treated with insecticide. In all plots, 20 seeds had been planted to ensure sufficient regeneration.</p><p> </p>",
