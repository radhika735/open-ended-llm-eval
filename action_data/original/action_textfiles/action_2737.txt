Removal of the smaller or larger sizes of fish from a population reduces the overall reproductive potential by killing either the immature fish before they have reached maturity or the larger fish that produce the highest numbers of eggs. Setting specific fish size ranges that allow harvesting of intermediate sizes may help protect the overall reproductive potential by avoiding fishing mortality of the smallest and largest individuals.</p>\r\n<p>For similar interventions, see <em>‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species’</em> and <a href=\"../../actions/2736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species’</em></a>.</p>",
