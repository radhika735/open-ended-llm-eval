In 1984-8, 13 chicks fledged from the site (2.7 chicks/year), whereas all previous nesting attempts had failed due to eggs and chicks falling from the small ledge. The ledge was 36 m up on a dolomitic limestone cliff and the authors caution that only two of four sticks of dynamite used detonated and, had all four exploded, the ledge may have been destroyed.

Nest boxes were also preferred over natural cavities (a maximum of 5-15% of natural cavities used vs. 53-88% of 17-19 nest boxes used each year). There were no differences in reproductive success or predation rates between large and small nest boxes (40-87% success for 54 clutches in large nest boxes vs. 33-86% success for 23 clutches in small nest boxes).
