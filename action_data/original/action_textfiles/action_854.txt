        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Animals are translocated either to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past, introduce species to new sites or to increase population numbers where the species is already present. The strategy can help to rescue populations from threats such as development, maintain or restore a species’ historical range or increase the total number of viable populations, to safeguard against loss of other populations. When translocating animals, consideration should be given to within-species diversity and local adaption, particularly when mixing populations in order to ensure that diversity and adaptive potential is not lost (Ficetola &amp; De Bernardi 2005).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">The majority of studies translocated amphibians to sites that had been occupied in the past but had no current population or to new sites. A smaller number of studies translocated animals to sites with an existing population.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">See also: '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/861\">Translocate frogs</a></span>', '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/856\">Translocate wood frogs</a></span>', '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/855\">Translocate toads</a></span>', '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/859\">Translocate natterjack toads</a></span>', '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/860\">Translocate salamanders (including newts)</a></span>' and '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/858\">Translocate great crested newts</a></span>'.</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Ficetola G.F. &amp; De Bernardi F.

Two of the programmes did result in breeding, in the eastern spadefoot <em>Pelobates syriacus</em> (larvae and juveniles translocated) and the banded newt <em>Triturus vittatus</em> (juveniles translocated). Translocation of the natterjack toad <em>Bufo calamita</em> in England was not considered successful. The release of half a million wild-caught and captive-bred Houston toads <em>Bufo houstonensis</em> (adults, juveniles, metamorphs, tadpoles) to 10 sites did not result in establishment of any populations. Success was unknown for the Coeur d'Alene salamander <em>Plethodon idahoensis</em> and Puerto Rican crested toad <em>Peltophryne lemur</em> (juveniles and adults translocated).

Four translocations of four species were likely to have been successful based on persistence of offspring records and one translocation failed. The success of five could not be assessed because of insufficient data. In 1980–1995, nine species of locally caught amphibians of different life stages were translocated to one or more of five sites. Monitoring involved frog call counts, funnel traps, drift-fences with pitfall traps, artificial coverboards and visual searches.</p><p> </p>",

Of the 38 translocation projects reviewed (25 species), 52% were successful, 29% failed and long-term success was uncertain for 19%. Projects releasing over 1,000 animals were significantly more successful (success: 65%) than those releasing less than 100 (0%) or 101–1,000 animals (38%). Success was independent of the source of animals (wild, captive, combination), life-stage translocated, continent and motivation for translocation (conservation: 90%; human-wildlife conflict: 8%; research: 3%). Translocations were of eggs, larvae and metamorphs in 71% of cases, adults in 45% and juveniles in 21% of cases. Wild animals were translocated in 76% of projects. The most common reported causes of failure were homing and migration and poor habitat. Success was defined as evidence of substantial recruitment to the adult population during monitoring over a period at least as long as it takes for the species to reach maturity.</p><p> </p>",
