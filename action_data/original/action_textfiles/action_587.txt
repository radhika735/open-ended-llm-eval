Wheat <em>Triticum aestivum</em> was planted and silt fencing erected to encourage vegetation growth, whilst suitable habitat was prepared on East Sand Island (see ‘Habitat creation – intertidal habitats’) along with several other interventions (see ‘Use decoys to attract birds to new nesting areas’, ‘Use vocalisations to attract birds to new nesting areas’ and ‘Control avian predators on islands’). The impact on conflict reduction (the purpose of the translocation) is discussed in ‘Move fish-eating birds to reduce conflict with fishermen’.</p><p> </p>",
