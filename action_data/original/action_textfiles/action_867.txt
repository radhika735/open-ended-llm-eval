Breeding occurred in three ponds in 1–3 years (3–38 larvae/pond). All ponds were used by newts in the first year, although four ponds only had 2–7 animals, the fifth had 40 newts. First year colonizers were biased towards males (38 vs 15) and tended to be 1–2 years old. By the third year one pond was used by 176 newts, two by 3–6 and two by zero newts. Colonization failed in the two ponds that were colonized by fish, although two of three fish species disappeared within a year. Five ponds were excavated in September 1992. Each was 12 x 5 m and 1.5 m deep with sloping banks. Newts were sampled by netting once a month in March-June 1993–1995. Animals were aged and tagged.</p><p> </p>",

Numbers of salamander captures increased from 428 in 1974 to 2,301 in 1995 at the release pond. Salamanders also colonized four additional created ponds (0.9–2.4 km). In 1966, spotted salamander egg masses were translocated 1 km to a newly constructed pond. Another six ponds were constructed at the site in 1965–1979. Monitoring was undertaken using drift-fencing with pitfall traps around ponds and by egg mass counts.</p><p> </p>",

By 2001, females and five clutches of eggs were found. By that time, pond banks were 75% covered by vegetation and shrubs were developing. Numbers of female salamanders counted in the area were variable, but similar before (1997: 50; 1998: 88) and after pond construction (1999: 89; 2000: 82; 2001: 58 in 2001). Two or three males were found in 1997–1999, one in 2000 and none in 2001. Two species of frog (<em>Hylarana latouchii </em>and <em>Microhyla mixture</em>) colonized in the year of construction. In June 1999, ponds were dug 50 m from two existing breeding habitats, within a similar environment. Ponds were 3 x 2 m and 0.4 m deep. Amphibians were monitored from 1997–2001.</p><p> </p>",

Tiger salamanders were not recorded following translocation. Ponds were created in 1995–1997 and were 2–4 m deep. Water, vegetation, plankton and organic matter (from local wetlands) were added. Spotted salamander eggs (600–1100), larvae (40–850) and metamorphs (4–33) and tiger salamander metamorphs (0–25) were added in spring 1996–1998 and 2000.

Fourteen ponds and many small ponds of different designs were created. Some aquatic plants were introduced. Management also included fish removal, hanging wildfowl deterrents, mowing, scrub clearance and creation of hibernacula. From 1994, 90 smooth newts were released into two created ponds annually.
