Therefore, maximising the time parent birds spend at their nest may reduce the incidence of parasitism. One possible way of doing this would be to provide supplementary food, meaning that birds have to spend less time foraging. Studies discussing this and other uses of supplementary feeding are discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
