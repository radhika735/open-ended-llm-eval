        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Many amphibians are killed by vehicles, particularly where their annual migration routes between breeding and over-wintering habitats cross roads. In some areas local volunteers may try to reduce deaths by collecting animals and releasing them on the other side of the road. Temporary drift-fencing and pitfall traps are often used to capture amphibians so that they can be assisted across the road. Patrols often focus on migrations to breeding sites rather than migrations of adults and juveniles away from those sites.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Ideally evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention would consist of survival rates, counts of animals in the population or numbers killed on the road before and after or at sites with and without human assistance. However, such evidence is rarely available and so here we not only present data on population trends, but also numbers of animals that were moved across roads and numbers and effort of patrols assisting amphibians.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">For other interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage amphibian populations or habitats see ‘Education and awareness raising – <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/831\">Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information</a></span>’ and ‘<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"../../actions/777\">Engage landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians</a></span>’.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\"> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The most frequent number moved by each patrol was 500–1,000 animals (28% of patrols).

Many patrols reported that an ‘appreciable proportion’ of the total number of migrating toads were moved by humans. However, only 20% of populations were believed to be stable or increasing. Patrols involved an average of 90 person-hours, as they tended to have 1–3 volunteers/night (range: 1–14) for 11–20 nights (1–49) each lasting two hours (1–7 hours). Most patrols had been active for 3–10 years (49 of 53 patrols). Forty-four sites had toad warning road signs. A questionnaire survey of most of the known and established toad patrols was undertaken.
