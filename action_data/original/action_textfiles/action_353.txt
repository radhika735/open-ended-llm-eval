Preferences decreased over time as preferred areas lost vegetation and became more crowded. Vegetation from experimental areas had a higher nitrogen content than that from control areas. Fertilisation consisted of 125 kg/ha of ‘nitro-chalk’ – 25% nitrogen – applied in mid October. In mid-October, the grass was also cut to approximately 8 cm.</p><p> </p>",

Split fertiliser application did not increase field use, compared to a single application (average of 11 droppings/m<sup>2</sup> for fields with split applications vs. 10 droppings/m<sup>2</sup> for single applications), although the authors note it may reduce nitrogen leeching. <strong> </strong></p><p> </p>",
