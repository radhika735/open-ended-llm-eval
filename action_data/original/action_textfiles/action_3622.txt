One of 14 terrapins that were caught in pots modified with the chimney died. Standard commercial crab pots (61 cm × 61 cm × 61 cm) were fitted with a chicken wire chimney (122 × 30.5 cm diameter) to provide trapped terrapins with access to air. Pots were deployed June–July in 2012 (4 sites) and 2013 (2 sites). Pots were baited and submerged for 48 hours at a time.</p>",
