The chance of the status of a species being stable or improving was similar for species with a recovery plan (66%) and without a plan (62%). The evaluation assessed species status of 56 species (including 3 reptile species: striped legless lizard <em>Delma impar</em>, Bellinger River Emydura <em>Emydura macquarii signata, </em>Blue Mountain’s water skink <em>Eulamprus leuraensis</em>) with a recovery plan and 67 threatened species (including 3 reptile species: Flinders Ranges worm-lizard <em>Aprasia pseudopulchella</em>, Mary River turtle <em>Elusor macrurus</em>, Krefft’s tiger snake <em>Notechis scutatus ater</em>) without a recovery plan.
