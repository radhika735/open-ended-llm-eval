It involves placing broods (once they can feed themselves and regulate their body temperature) in an artificial nest site where they can be fed without imprinting on humans. The birds can learn about their environment and gradually learn to fly and hunt, with food provided until it is no longer taken (Jones 2004).</p>\r\n<p>Jones, C.G.
