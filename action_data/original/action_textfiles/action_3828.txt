They typically involve financial help and incentives for fishers, particularly those with low income or in poverty. Gear exchange programmes may reduce unwanted catch by providing more selective gears to reduce fish mortality, damage to fish habitats and the impacts of illegal fishing (Signa <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>\r\n<p>Signa D., Tuda P. &amp; Samoilys M.
