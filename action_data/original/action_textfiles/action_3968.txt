Raising the cutting height by a few centimetres may allow more individuals to survive underneath the mower, or leave more resources available.</p>\r\n<p><sub>Humbert J.Y., Ghazoul J., Sauter G.J. &amp; Walter T.

On plots cut to 10 cm, the abundance (1–2 individuals/transect) and species richness (1 species/transect) of butterflies, and the abundance of caterpillars (0–5 caterpillars/transect), were not significantly different from plots cut to 5 cm (butterfly abundance: 0–2 individuals/transect; richness: 0–1 species/transect; caterpillar abundance: 0–4 caterpillars/transect). In April 2002, six experimental plots (50 × 10 m) were established on permanent pastures (&gt;5-years-old) on four farms. All plots were fertilized (225 kg nitrogen/ha, 22 kg phosphorus/ha, 55 kg potassium/ha), cut twice/year in May and July, and grazed in September. Three plots/farm were cut to 10 cm, and three were cut to 5 cm. From June–September 2003–2006, butterflies were surveyed once/month on a 50-m transect through the centre of each plot. In April, June, July and September 2003–2006, caterpillars were counted (but not identified) on two 10-m transects/plot using a sweep net (20 sweeps/transect).</p>",

The proportion of large white caterpillars killed by mowing at 9 cm (30–43%) was not significantly different from the proportion killed by mowing at 6 cm (35–37%). Similarly, the proportion of wax models damaged by mowing at 9 cm (16.9%) was not significantly different from the proportion damaged by mowing at 6 cm (17.4%). In 2007–2008, in each of nine meadows, two 2.5-m-long plots were randomly assigned to either 9 cm or 6 cm cutting height, and mown with a 2.5-m-wide tractor-pulled rotary mower. Before mowing, half of 200 wax caterpillar models (100 large and 100 small) were placed on the ground and half were tied to vegetation 20–30 cm high in each plot. In 2008, on five meadows, large white caterpillars were placed on the ground (50 caterpillars) and in the vegetation (50 caterpillars) in each plot. After mowing, wax models and caterpillars that survived were checked for damage or injuries.</p>",
