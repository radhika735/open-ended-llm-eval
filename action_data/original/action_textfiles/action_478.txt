This means they are vulnerable to predators and frequently nest on small islands and patches of vegetation. Providing these habitats where they are absent may increase the number of birds using a site, increase their reproductive success, or allow the colonisation of new lakes.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

They were covered in hessian, netting and turf and anchored to concrete blocks in shallow (1-3 m) water close to natural nest sites known to be susceptible to flooding and hidden from public roads to avoid illegal egg collecting.
