Foraging success, number of eggs and number of young fledged were ‘markedly higher’ when supplementary food was provided. The weight of food provided ranged from 167-553 kg annually for each nest, with between one and six nests supplied each year. The study does not report the relative breeding success of supplied and unsupplied nests.</p><p> </p>",
