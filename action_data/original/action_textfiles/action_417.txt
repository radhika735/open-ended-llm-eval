Supplementary feeding in the summer (when harriers are provisioning young) reduced the number of grouse chicks being brought to 14 fed broods, compared to ten unfed broods (an average of 0.5 chicks/100 hr, seven in total vs. 3.7 chicks/100 hr, 32 in total).

Birds and small mammals were responsible for more predation events in food-supplemented plots, whilst unknown predators were responsible for more in non-supplemented plots. Nests were placed on the ground and contained two Japanese quail <em>Corturnix</em> <em>japonica </em>eggs and one wax covered wooden egg. This study also evaluated the impact of prescribed burning on nest survival, discussed in ‘Use prescribed burning – pine forests’. There was no interaction between feeding and burning.</p><p> </p>",
