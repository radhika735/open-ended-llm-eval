Consideration must be given to the potential impacts of incubation conditions (for example temperature and humidity) on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings (Warner &amp; Andrews 2002, Booth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies where eggs are incubated in artificial conditions, which ranges from controlled laboratory settings to using polystyrene boxes to incubate eggs in buildings. Studies are also included where gravid females are brought into captivity to lay eggs, but eggs are taken away from the females for artificial incubation.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.

Hatching success was lower for eggs incubated at the coolest or warmest temperatures (22°C: 6 of 12, 50%; 32°C: 7 of 17, 41%) compared to eggs incubated at intermediate temperatures (24°C: 25 of 32, 78%; 27°C: 19 of 24, 79%; 30°C: 23 of 29, 79%). Incubation period decreased with increased temperatures from 102 days at 22°C to 51 days at 32°C. Five of seven morphological features were also affected by incubation temperature (see paper for more details). In 1998, thirteen captive-born gravid females were acquired and housed in a wire cage (200 x 80 x 80 cm) at 30°C. Eggs were incubated at 22, 24, 27, 30 or 32°C, with eggs from each clutch split evenly between temperatures. Eggs were incubated individually in covered plastic jars in vermiculite and water at a ratio of 1:2. Hatchlings were euthanized by freezing to -15°C to measure a 0range of morphological features.</p>",
