Eleven helium balloons also appeared useful in frightening cormorants habituated to ropes. During the week prior to addition 0.29 cormorants/min/day entered, whereas in the week after 0.02 entered. A 4.6 ha pond was monitored for 1,019 minutes before rope installation and 2,418 minutes after.</p><p> </p>",

Gill nets (large diameter mesh enabling young fish to swim through) were hung vertically in the water and harassment patrols (people walking around the ponds) were undertaken. Three ponds of 0.1 ha were stocked with fry (50,000-60,000 fish/ha) and one of 0.3 ha stocked with fingerlings (8,000/ha). Survival rates of fry in the three smaller ponds was 0.3%, 0.8% and 3.5% (average 1.5%), and survival of fingerlings 0.9%.</p><p> </p>",
