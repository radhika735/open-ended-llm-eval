A 3 x 6 m pool (water depth 10 cm) was used. Nine adult egrets either foraged alone or in threes. Three trials were undertaken using clear or turbid water, with three densities of prey i.e. mosquito fish <em>Gambusia affinis</em> (1, 2, and 4/m²). Treatment order was randomised and trials lasted 5 min. Turbid water was created by adding clay (Secchi disc lost from view at 10 cm depth).</p><p> </p>",
