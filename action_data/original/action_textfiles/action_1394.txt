In plots with added organic matter, compost was added two times/year, and a cover crop (<em>Secale cereale </em>Merced rye) was grown every autumn or winter. Lettuce or broccoli crops were grown on raised beds. Sprinklers and drip irrigation were used in all plots. Soils were disturbed to different depths (conventional tillage: disking to 50 cm depth, cultivating, sub-soiling, bed re-making, and bed-shaping; reduced tillage: cultivating to 20 cm depth, rolling, and bed-shaping). It was not clear whether these results were a direct effect of adding compost or growing cover crops.</p><p> </p>",
