On grazed shrubland, the total abundance (469–1,188 individuals), species richness (82–124 species) and diversity (data presented as model results) of pollinators, including butterflies, were all similar to ungrazed shrubland (abundance: 576–925 individuals; richness: 86–113 species). Four pairs of sites (20–1,850 ha), similar in topography and vegetation, were selected. Within each pair, one site was grazed with cattle for 4–6 weeks between April and June annually or biannually, at 14–160 cows/ha/month, while the other site had been ungrazed for 6–40 years. From April–July 2010, pollinating insects were sampled eight times (bi-weekly) by setting 30 yellow, white and blue 12-oz pan-traps for 8.5 hours at 3-m intervals diagonally across a 1-ha plot at each site. Paired sites were always sampled on the same day.</p>",

After 16–18 years of grazing, the moth community in a lightly grazed and an ungrazed saltmarsh was different from that in a heavily grazed saltmarsh (data presented as model results). See paper for individual species results. Until 1990, a 1,050-ha saltmarsh was grazed at 10 sheep/ha. From 1991, four paddocks (100–256 ha) were lightly (1–2 sheep/ha), moderately (3–4 sheep/ha) or heavily grazed (10 sheep/ha), or left ungrazed (0 sheep/ha). The marsh was grazed from May–October, with sheep removed only during flooding events. From April–October 2007–2009, micro-moths were sampled using a 1-m<sup>2</sup> steel emergence trap in each of three 150 × 20 m plots/paddock (&gt;250 m apart). Traps were emptied weekly and repositioned every three weeks, therefore sampling 10 m<sup>2</sup>/plot/year.</p>",
