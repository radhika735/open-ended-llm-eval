At the site with intensive control over three years, no snakes were seen from 1997 and larval toad counts increased from 1,300 in 1991 to 2,200 in 1999. Control was not considered successful by the authors at the second site due to the large snake population and more open habitat. Viperine snakes were controlled by capturing intensive one site in 1991–1993 and by capturing less intensively at the second site in 2002.</p><p> </p>",
