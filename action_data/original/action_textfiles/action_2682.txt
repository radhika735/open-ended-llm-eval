Specific marine areas can be given protected status, and the human activities undertaken within the areas managed to control potentially harmful impacts. One such measure is to ban all types of fishing in a protected area. These areas are often known as marine reserves or sanctuaries, or ‘no-take’ areas. Inside no-take areas, fish are protected from fishing mortality and may allow depleted populations to recover. Fish may also benefit from the reduction in disturbance, particularly during sensitive periods such as spawning, and potential damage to important spawning habitats. Fish that spend a large proportion of time inside no-take protected areas may be expected to have higher protection from fishing mortality than longer-ranging species or individuals, and level of protection may also depend on the size of the protected area (Chateau &amp; Wantiez, 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under <a href=\"../../actions/2674\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>‘Control human activity in a marine protected with a zonation system of restrictions'</em></a>, <a href=\"../../actions/2681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>'Cease or prohibit all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions</em>’</a> and <a href=\"../../actions/2680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘<em>Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area</em>’</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Collie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. &amp; Poiner I.R.

Three of four no-take reserves in the Philippines had higher overall fish abundances than fished areas after only one year and in one it had doubled after eight years closure (data not reported). For two reserves in the Caribbean Sea (Belize and Netherland Antilles) established for four years, higher fish densities and average sizes were found for a small number of species, but the biomass of four of five commercially targeted family groups was greater (unfished: 0.1–6.0 kg/count, fished: 0.1–2.0 kg/count), however the effect differed with depth and level of fishing intensity in adjacent fished areas. In a reserve in the Red Sea (Egypt), the effect of prohibiting fishing for 15 years on the abundance and biomass of commercial species was variable and for seven species where they were higher in reserves, average fish weights increased with decreasing fishing intensity (unfished: 42–1,333 g, lightly fished: 41–678 g, fished: 19–447 g).

Overall fish numbers were on average 3.7 times higher inside non-fished reserves than outside. Abundances of fishery targeted species were higher in non-fished reserves than fished areas outside, but non-target species abundance was similar (data reported as statistical model results). Across all species, the effect of protection status (non-fished versus fished) on abundance depended on fish body size; the largest species were over 300% more abundant inside reserves and the effect increased with body size (data reported as model results). The systematic review used data from 24 studies to assess the effects of banning fishing in marine reserves. Twelve of the studies met the criteria for quantitative meta-analysis, the other 12 studies were not included in the meta-analysis.</p>",

Variation in species responses was also found with time since protection, with abundances of top predators increasing gradually and accounting for greater proportions of the total biomass in the reserves (data reported as response ratios). A literature search for field studies examining the effect of prohibiting all fishing types in no-take reserves on fish communities was carried out.

Experimental netting data showed higher total abundance, abundance of scorpionfish <em>Scorpaenidae</em> spp. and species richness inside the reserve than outside the reserve in October 2006 (total: 4–9, scorpionfish: 1–3, richness: 3–5/100 m) and June 2007 (total: 1–2, scorpionfish: 0–1, richness: 1–2/100 m). The Cap-Roux Marine Protected Area (450 ha) was closed to all fishing in 2003. Two stations were sampled in each of three zones, one inside the reserve and two outside (north and south) of the reserve boundaries. At each station six replicate underwater visual censuses over seagrass beds and six 100 m trammel net deployments were undertaken. Sampling was undertaken seasonally from 2005–2007. Only data from 2006 were included in the analysis. For full sampling details see original study.</p>",

Across bot sampling methods, fish abundances differed between non-fished and fished areas, with about half of the species recorded as common to both management areas by each method being more abundant in closed areas (data reported graphically and as statistical results). Visual census sampling found that the total number of fish species was higher in closed (134) than fished areas (94) and species diversity was similar (0.94–0.95).

In addition, there was no relationship between the size or age of reserves or area surveyed and the species density (fish and invertebrates) response, but it was found to be associated with one of four variables, intensity of exploitation outside the reserve (i.e. the higher the exploitation level the greater the species response). The systematic review summarized the effects of protection from fishing activities at 23 marine reserves established from 1959 to 2001 in Latin American and Caribbean countries.

At each reserve, three sites were sampled inside and three outside the reserve boundaries, one at each depth of 5, 15 and 30 m (date or year of sampling unspecified). Fish were identified and counted by diver underwater visual survey along three, 50 × 5 m transects at each site. Herbivorous fish and fish that predate on sea urchins <em>Paracentrotus lividus</em> were recorded (see paper for list of families).

Areas where all (line and traps only) or most (spear and gill nets also used) destructive gears were restricted had 390 and 382 kg/ha of fishable biomass, respectively. The lowest biomass was in areas with no gear restrictions (269 kg/ha, 50 sites, seines and explosives used). In addition, many of the individual sites, even in areas with closures and high compliance, had a fishable biomass below 1,150 kg/ha (estimated by the authors as the target standing stock biomass needed for the recovery of exploited reef fish), and were thus failing to achieve conservation targets. Coral reef fish assemblages were surveyed at 233 individual sites across the Indian Ocean (off Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, the Maldives, Seychelles, the Chagos archipelago and Tanzania) between 2005–2012. Fish were surveyed at each site by underwater visual census (3 to 5 belt transects of 50 or 100 m, or 8 point counts – see original paper for sampling methods by country). Sites were classified by the six dominant management categories.</p>",

Average total length of nesting males was 119–141 mm and females 131–136 mm. In 2014, a total of 1,057 corkwing wrasses were tagged during (May–June) and after (July) the spawning period: 492 within a temporary no-fishing site (600 m of coastline, duration of protection was not reported) and 565 in a nearby site with no fishing restrictions. Fishing mortality of tagged wrasse was determined by recording the numbers captured and retained on all commercial potting fishing trips occurring within the bay over a three-month period.</p>",

Data were presented graphically and as statistical results. Trends over time showed increases in average fish densities (fish/ha), biomasses (g/ha) or sizes (length to tail fork, mm) in the unfished zone compared to the fished zone: for large, and small, plant/algae-eating fish (<em>Scaridae</em> spp.), one invertebrate-eating fish (hogfish <em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em>) and two of three predatory (fish and/or invertebrates) fish (Nassau grouper <em>Epinephelus striatus</em> and black grouper <em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em>). Average density and biomass of the other predatory species (mutton snapper <em>Lutjanus analis</em>) showed no clear trends over time in the unfished zone, but size decreased. Black grouper density decreased, and biomass remained steady in both the unfished and fished zones, and small herbivores decreased in both unfished and fished areas over time. Diffferences between the unfished and fished zones were generally greater for the species at lower levels of the food chain (e.g. plant/algae eaters). Glover’s Reef Atoll was established as a Marine Reserve in 1993 and has several management zones including no-take (80 km<sup>2</sup>, all fishing banned), and general use (270 km<sup>2</sup>, fishing permitted, with regulations – see original paper for details). Fish in five no-take patch reefs and six fished reefs were monitored between 2007–2009, increased in 2010–2013 to include 12 additional fished reefs. Each reef was sampled once a year during April, May, or June. Fish number and estimated size over the entire area of each reef down to 3 m was recorded by snorkellers.</p>",

No differences in total fish catch rates and catch rates of three of six fish groups (<em>Acanthuridae - Naso spp., Holocentridae, Lethrinidae</em>) were found since implementation, but catch rates of the remaining three (<em>Acanthuridae - Acanthurus spp., Scaridae, Serranidae</em>) decreased (data reported as statistical results). In addition, no difference in overall fishing effort was found (data reported as statistical results), but the authors reported that this was likely to be due to reduced travel to fishing grounds further away by resident fishers with the new exclusive rights. Co-management formally commenced on the island of ‘O’ua (one of 170 Tongan Islands) in 2007, covering a marine area of 4,606 ha, of which 203 ha is a no-take zone. Only residents on ‘Ou’a can fish the co-managed area. Fish catches were sampled (species and weight per trip) each year between 2007–2011 (total 184 records), collected opportunistically from landings by individual fishers (see original paper for fishing types). Catch data from spearfishing only was used for statistical analysis.</p>",

The data were not statistically tested. Only 2% (five) of the 262 conventional tags deployed on sharks were recovered (the rest were either not caught or not reported), captured by small-scale fisheries at locations outside the reserve between 223–366 km away on average 587 days after tagging. Four of six sharks tracked by satellite remained inside the reserve boundaries for the entire monitoring period (1.3 years), and two were detected outside the reserve for 9% and 57% of time, travelling distances of up to 88 and 810 km respectively. Recovery of satellite-tagged sharks was not reported. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (54,126 km<sup>2</sup>) was established in 2001 (boundaries extended in 2009 and 2014) and prohibits all fishing and other extractive activities. From October 2006 to July 2009, a total of 262 grey reef sharks were caught in the reserve and marked with conventional tags on the dorsal fin. Recovered tags were actively sought (in 2007, 2009 and 2013) and encouraged from fishers at the three nearest inhabited and fished atolls several hundred kilometres away. During the same period, 11 fin-mounted satellite tags were deployed on adult sharks at the reserve, providing adequate data on the movements of six.</p>",

In addition, ray detections inside the no-fishing reserves varied with season (winter: 53%, rest of year: 23%). Shovelnose rays were tracked from January 2015 to March 2016 in and around five marine reserves (fishing and extractive activities prohibited; the year established was not reported) located in Moreton Bay Marine Park. A total of 20 rays were surgically fitted with acoustic transmitters and released at two seagrass sites adjacent to reserves. The rays were tracked by 28 receivers (covering 180 km<sup>2</sup>) located in no-fishing and fished areas. Tracking data were analysed for 16 rays detected by receivers for longer than seven days, up to the removal of the receivers fifteen months later.</p>",
