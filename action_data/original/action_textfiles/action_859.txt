Two of three dune sites had breeding within three years and the third (&gt; 5 years old) established one of the largest populations. Five of 17 translocations on heathland were successful, with stable or increasing adult numbers and breeding for at least five years. Six less than three years old, all produced toadlets in their first year. Six failed (five pre-1980) with no successful metamorphosis. Ten successful translocations were to sites with new ponds, in heathland six were concrete and one butyl plastic lined. Nine were undertaken after 1991 and comprised translocations of eggs (two spawn strings, i.e. 5,000 eggs) each year for two years. Scrub clearance was undertaken at two dune and seven heath sites. One heath site had limestone added to acidic ponds. Low-density sheep or cattle grazing (&lt;1 animal/3 ha) was established at one dune and two heath sites. Spawn strings were counted and toadlet production estimated.</p><p> </p>",

Re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarshes was more successful than on heathland (85 vs 57% success). Translocations have resulted in populations of over 200 adults at some sites, although at other sites populations have remained small. The 10 translocations since 2000 have resulted in an increase of known natterjack sites from about 40 in 1970 to 69 in 2010. Between 1975 and 2010, toads were translocated to 29 sites. Reintroductions were mainly through translocation of eggs and tadpoles from existing populations. In some cases, head-starting of tadpoles and captive breeding was also undertaken. Habitat management has also been undertaken at some sites. Since 1985 all populations have been monitored annually.</p><p> </p>",

The average population trend for translocation sites was significantly positive (0.10) while that for native sites did not differ significantly from zero (−0.04). Numbers of years of translocations of wild (including head-started) animals, but not captive-bred animals had a significant effect on population trends. Overall, five of the 20 sites showed positive population trends, five showed negative trends and 10 trends were not significantly different from zero. Data on populations (egg string counts) and management activities over 11–21 years were obtained from the Natterjack Toad Site Register.

In 2001, a total of 5,000 adult and juvenile toads were translocated from a development site to three receptor sites where natterjacks were still or were historically present. Toads were captured using 5 km of drift-fencing with pitfall traps and 160 plywood or carpet boards laid over a 400 ha area.
