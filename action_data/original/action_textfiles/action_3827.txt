It seeks to continually improve management strategies in response to new information and measured changes (e.g. in climate or population). However, adaptive management methods are often based on predicted outcomes, for example using Management Strategy Evaluation (Edwards &amp; Dankel 2016) and therefore not including in the evidence here. Employing adaptive management in fisheries may help prevent over-fishing or restore depleted populations.</p>\r\n<p>Walters C.J.
