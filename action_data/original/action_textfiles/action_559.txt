There were no differences in laying date, clutch size, number of fledglings or chick weights between treatments. Calcium was provided in the form of small snail shell and eggshell fragments in a feeder within the nest boxes. Control nest boxes had empty feeders in. A subset of the data from this study is discussed in (6).</p><p> </p>",

Several studies are discussed in this section. Positive effects on at least one egg-related trait were detected in three species: house wrens <em>Troglodytes aedon</em> (clutch size but not egg size), pied flycatchers <em>Ficedula hypoleuca</em> (eggshell thickness and egg volume) and great tits <em>Parus major</em> (fewer females not nesting, fewer abandoning nests, thicker eggshells and higher hatching success; uncertain evidence for increases in clutch size and advanced laying date (4,7,10)). However, such effects were missing in all traits measured in a study of blue tits <em>P. caeruleus</em> in Scotland (egg mass and volume, eggshell thickness, laying date, clutch size, fledging success). Similarly, positive effects on chick traits were detected in four species: cape vultures <em>Gyps coprotheres</em> (reduced incidence of bone deformation (1)), black terns <em>Childonias niger</em> (higher weight gain (3)), pied flycatchers (higher chick growth rates (11)), great tits (chick growth and fledging success (10)). Such impacts were absent in house wrens (fledgling body mass or number of fledglings, (2)) or purple martins <em>Progne subis </em>(growth rate of fledglings, (9)). One study (11) also reported a positive effect on adult female body condition in pied flycatchers but not great tits in Estonia.</p><p> </p>",

            "paragraph_text": "<p class=\"\\\">A replicated, controlled trial in <strong> </strong>mixed forest site in Estonia in 2000-1 (Tilgar et al. 2004) found that hatching success of great tit <em>Parus major</em> chicks did not differ between calcium-supplemented and control nests, but that a higher proportion of supplemented chicks fledged in 2000 (93% of hatched eggs from 14 supplemented nests vs. 78% from 19 controls), but not 2001 (78% of hatched eggs from 25 supplemented nests vs. 70% from 17 controls). At 15 days old, supplemented chicks were no larger or heavier than controls, but showed significantly lower levels of bone calcification activity. This suggests that supplemented nestlings already had fully developed bones by the time measurements were taken. The consequences for fitness and future reproduction may include decreased predation or parasitism in chicks and a lower reproductive costs for parents (because of shorter nestling periods), but these are not investigated in this study. This difference was only apparent in 2000, possibly because 2001 was a very poor year for reproduction, lowering growth rates and fledging success for all broods. Supplementation consisted of chicken eggshell provided in excess in small feeders on the outside of nest boxes.</p><p> </p>",
