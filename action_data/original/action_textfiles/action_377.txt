Before pig control, the woodhen population was a maximum of ten breeding pairs, with adult mortality higher than juvenile recruitment. Following pig control, 56 released, captive-bred birds were found to survive for up to two years and 19 young were successfully raised between 1982 and 1984. Additionally, woodhens have started to expand their range from the unfavourable territories they were previously confined to, to more favourable, previously pig-infested regions. A total of 186 were destroyed between 1979 and 1981. This study is also discussed in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ and ‘Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations’.</p><p> </p>",

Over the same period, there was a smaller increase in rails detected on Ferdandina Island, which has remained free from invasive mammals (no rails detected during surveys in 1986-7 although some were heard outside survey times, 11 rails detected in 2004-5) and a decrease on Isabella Island, which retains feral goats, pigs and donkeys (13 rails in 247 survey plots at eight sites in 2004-5 vs. 24 rails in 60 survey plots in 1986-7). Donkeys <em>Equus asinus</em>, 17,000 pigs <em>Sus scrofa </em>and 70,000 goats <em>Capra hircus </em>were removed.</p><p> </p>",
