Half of the clams died after exposure to 0.69 mg per litre of chlorine in tanks for 10 days. Up to 89% died within four days of exposure to 140 mg per litre of potassium. Copper was the most toxic with half of the clams dying when exposed to 0.59 mg per litre for one day and 0.04 mg per litre for four days. The toxicity of several biocides was tested in static and continuous-flow tests. Fourteen replicate tanks and four artificial streams were used, respectively. There were 12 clams per tank and nine clams per artificial stream (flow rates were maintained at 0.5-0.8 litres/min). Clams were exposed to various concentrations of chlorine, potassium and copper for between one and 10 days. Survival of clams was checked and recorded.</p><p> </p>",

A constant high dose (0.5-1.0 mg/litre TRC) for 32 days at 20 °C killed 60-95% of the clams. In the field, 90% of clams were killed when exposed to a 28 day dose of 0.25 mg/litre TRC during the spring when ambient temperatures were 20-25 °C. In the autumn, &lt;24% of clams were killed when exposed to a 28 day dose of &lt;0.5 mg/litre TRC, when ambient temperatures were lower (12-20 °C).  No clams died in the control treatments. In the laboratory tests, 30 adult clams were placed in one of five replicate artificial streams with chlorine treatments. Juveniles were added to some replicates. Survival of clams was recorded daily. In the field, two flow-through chambers (1 x 0.25 m) in spring and three in autumn were used to expose 25-30 Asian clams with chlorinated water. Chambers were placed at four sites within the intake stream of an industrial plant which suffered from Asian clam fouling. A control group of clams was exposed to non-chlorinated water.

This targeted method of delivery to the filter-feeding clams resulted in the need for reduced concentrations of the chemicals. The product was approved for use within in-service irrigation systems for almonds, cherries and olives, and there were no negative effects on the crops.  The chemical SB1000 was dosed at 150 mg/l and SB2000 at 30 mg/l for eight hours a day for two days, using a calibrated powder doser, with the products being delivered into different parts of the irrigation system. The number of live, freshly gaping and freshly empty shells were monitored before and after dosing and subsamples of clams were measured.

Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</p>\r\n<p>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</p>\r\n<p>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the controlling the target invasive species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the decrease in cover of a plant or the percentage mortality of an invasive animal. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an reduction of the target invasive species in the natural habitat where they require control.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>:The ‘harms’ scale is from 0 (none) to 100 (major; this equates to an increase in parrot’s feather). For the sake of this assessment, ‘harms’ should be a measure of any negative effects, in terms of the introduction, establishment and spread of parrot’s feathers, that are caused by the action. We are aware that some actions in the assessment are likely to have potential negative impacts on non-target native species (e.g. draining a waterbody to control a non-native plant may also have impacts on native animal and plant species). However, this information was rarely presented in the evidence summarized, and hence is not present in the synopsis. Considering that your assessment should be based only on the information presented in the synopsis, the category ‘harms’ should therefore only consider information relating to the impact of the action upon parrot’s feather. Where relevant, potential harms to native species or habitats will be flagged up in the Background section of an intervention to ensure that the user is aware that these should be considered before implementing this intervention.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for control of parrot's feather that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the second round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>When you login, the actions to be reviewed will be listed on the:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a) <strong>Pending tab</strong> – where your scores put the action in a different category to the group median scores</p>\r\n<p>b) <strong>Agree tab</strong> - where your own scores put the action in the same category as the group median scores.</p>\r\n<p>These instructions are always available from the link on the left hand side of this page (Read Instructions), and we encourage you to refer to them whenever you need to while taking part in the assessment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Open each action from the <strong>Pending/Agree</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title.
