        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Small protrusions’ are elevations with a length to width ratio ≤3:1 that protrude 1–50 mm from the substratum (modified from “Small elevations” in Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Small protrusions create vertical or horizontal (i.e. overhangs) relief in subtidal rocky habitats. They can provide organisms refuge from predation or grazing (Wahl &amp; Hoppe 2002) and have positive effects on fish populations (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2018). Some species preferentially recruit to habitats with high vertical or horizontal relief (Andrews &amp; Anderson 2004). The size and density of protrusions is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms and limit their growth. Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, horizontal protrusions (overhangs) create shaded and downward-facing surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).</p>\r\n<p>Protrusions are sometimes present on artificial structures such as cable mattresses (Lacey &amp; Hayes 2020) or quarried boulders (MacArthur <em>et al.</em> 2020), but are often absent from other types of structures. Small protrusions can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating protrusions on artificial reefs (e.g. Gratwicke &amp; Speight 2005; Morris <em>et al.</em> 2018). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3449\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3443\"><em>Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3444\"><em>Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3445\"><em>Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Andrews K.S. &amp; Anderson T.W.

Data were not statistically tested. After 42 months, there were 58 kelp individuals on the surface with small protrusions (wet weight: 1.09 kg) and 20 on the surface without (0.31 kg). There were 2–3 individuals of each of three other canopy algae species on the surface with protrusions (0.01–0.09 kg) and 3–18 of each on the surface without (0.05–0.17 kg). Small protrusions were created on a concrete breakwater block (2.3 × 2.3 × 0.8 m) by attaching 45 pebbles (diameter/height: 35–45 mm), evenly-spaced on a 644 × 529 mm horizontal surface. One adjacent surface had no protrusions. The block was placed on sandy seabed at 9 m depth in November 1985. Macroalgae on surfaces with and without small protrusions were counted and weighed (wet weight) after 42 months.</p>",
