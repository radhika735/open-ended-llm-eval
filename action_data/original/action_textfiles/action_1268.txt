The survival rate of Engelmann spruce was higher with the three light-coloured tree shelters (95-99%) than the controls (70%) and the lowest with the dark brown shelters (5%). Four replicates of each of five treatments were randomly assigned to 20 plots in each of three blocks (0.5 ha): four colours of recycled polyethylene plastic tree shelters (31 cm height and 9 cm diameter), ranging from nearly clear to brown, and a control (using materials from within the site, e.g. logs, stumps, shrubs, rocks, to protect seedlings). In August-September 1996, 25 seedlings were planted in each plot (total of 1,500 seedlings). Data were collected in 1997.</p><p> </p>",

After 37 months, seedling height was greater with tree guards (80 cm) than control (57 cm). However, after 44 months, there was no difference between treatments (control: 85; tree guards: 96 cm). Fifteen oak seedlings were planted in each of four replicate (rows) of each tree guards (45 cm high plastic tree guard) and control treatments. All rows were covered with weed mats (0.4 × 0.4 m hessian cloth around each seeding). Seedlings were planted in June 1999 and observed for approximately 44 months.</p><p> </p>",
