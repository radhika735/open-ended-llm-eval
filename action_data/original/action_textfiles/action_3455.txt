        "background_definitions": "<p><strong>Definition:</strong> ‘Pit habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio ≤3:1 and depth 1–50 mm (Strain <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Pit habitats provide organisms refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Nelson &amp; Vance 1979). Some species preferentially settle into them (Nozawa <em>et al.</em> 2011). The size and density of pits is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small pits can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Large pits can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms.</p>\r\n<p>Pits are sometimes present on boulders used in marine artificial structures as a result of quarrying processes (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2018), and can form on other structures through erosion. However, these are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira <em>et al.</em> 2007) and are absent from many structures. Pit habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.</p>\r\n<p>There is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating pit habitats on artificial substrates for coral rearing and gardening (e.g. Nozawa <em>et al.</em> 2011; Okamoto <em>et al.</em> 2010). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on <em>in situ</em> conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"../../actions/3449\"><em>Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3446\"><em>Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3434\"><em>Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3448\"><em>Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3454\"><em>Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>; <a href=\"../../actions/3452\"><em>Create groove habitats </em>and<em> small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Firth L.B., Airoldi L., Bulleri F., Challinor S., Chee S.-Y., Evans A.J., Hanley M.E., Knights A.M., O’Shaughnessy K., Thompson R.C. &amp; Hawkins S.J.

After 24 months, the macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity was higher on blocks with added habitats than without (data reported as Shannon index) and the community composition differed (data reported as statistical model results). Thirty species (7 mobile invertebrates, 14 non-mobile invertebrates, 9 fishes) recorded on and around blocks with added habitats were absent from blocks without. Species abundances varied on blocks with and without added habitats depending on the species group (see paper for results). It is not clear whether these effects were the direct result of creating pits, holes, grooves, or using environmentally-sensitive material. Pit habitats were created on breakwater blocks (1 × 1 × 1 m) using a formliner. Each block had multiple round pits (diameter: 10 mm; depth: 5 mm; T. Hadary <em>pers. comms.</em>) amongst multiple holes and grooves (number/spacing not reported). Five blocks of each of three patented ECOncrete<sup>TM</sup> materials (lower pH and different cement/additives to standard-concrete) were placed at 5–7 m depth on a concrete-block breakwater during construction in July 2012. Five standard-concrete blocks (1.7 × 1.7 × 1.7 m) without added habitats were placed on a similar breakwater 80 m away. Macroalgae and invertebrates on blocks, and fishes on and around blocks, were counted over 24 months.</p>",
