When herbicide was not used, differences were inconsistent. <strong>Pest numbers: </strong>More weeds were found in plots with no tillage, in some comparisons (9 of 12 comparisons with herbicide use on fallows, in 1998: 4–12% vs 0–3% weed cover; two of 12 comparisons without herbicide use on fallows, in 1998: 5–6% vs 2%), but fewer weeds were found in two of 12 comparisons without herbicide use on fallows, in 1998 (4–5% vs 11%). In 1997, similar weed cover was found in plots with or without tillage (1–4%). <strong>Methods:</strong> There were 12 plots (4.5 x 27.5 m plots) for each of four treatments (two grass-legume mixtures, or two legumes without grasses, as winter cover crops, sown in October 1996–1997, killed and retained as mulch, with no tillage, in March 1997–1998) and each of two controls (bare-soil fallows in winter, with or without herbicide, and conventional tillage in spring). Tomato seedlings were transplanted in April 1997–1998. The tomatoes were irrigated (two inches/week) and fertilized (0, 100, or 200 lb N/acre). All plots were hand weeded in May, June, and July, and control plots were also cultivated in May and June. Weed cover was estimated before cultivation (July 1997 and May, June, and July 1998) or after cultivation (May and June 1997), in three quadrats/plot (1.8 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats).
