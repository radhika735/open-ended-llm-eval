        "background_definitions": "<p>Sea turtles are vulnerable to being hooked in the mouth or swallowing hooks on longline fishing hooks when foraging for bait attached to the hooks. They may also be hooked in the body or become entangled in the longlines when swimming in the vicinity of lines that have been set.</p>\r\n<p>Three main types of fishing hooks are typically used in longline fisheries: J-hooks, tuna hooks, and circle hooks. J-hooks are shaped like a ‘J’, with the hook point parallel to the hook shaft. Circle hooks are more rounded than J-hooks with the hook point turned in so that it is at right-angles to the hook shaft (FAO 2009). Tuna hooks are shaped in between a J-hook and a circle hook.</p>\r\n<p>Using circle hooks may reduce unwanted catch compared to J-hooks because they are wider and so may be less likely to fit into a turtle’s mouth. They may also reduce the incidences of turtles swallowing hooks, thereby increasing the chances of turtles surviving after being caught and released (Ryder <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>\r\n<p>This action includes studies that discuss comparisons between different types of circle hook with different types of J-hook.

Mackerel-baited circle hooks reduced loggerhead <em>Caretta caretta</em> catch by 90% (0.04 turtles/1,000 hooks), squid-baited circle hooks by 86% (0.05 turtles/1,000 hooks), and mackerel-baited J-hooks by 71% (0.13 turtles/1,000 hooks) compared to when squid-baited J-hooks were used (0.5 turtles/1,000 hooks).

Most (55 of 80) loggerheads caught swallowed J-hooks, while few swallowed circle hooks (3 of 11, results were not statistically tested). No leatherback turtles swallowed either hook type.

Thirteen vessels made 489 deployments, fishing a total of 427,382 hooks (71,000 hooks/bait for each of the four new combinations and 142,000 hooks for the standard combination).

Catch rates of commercially-targeted bigeye tuna <em>Thunnus obesus</em> increased when circle hooks were used (23 fish/1,000 hooks) compared to J-hooks (17 fish/1,000 hooks). Catch rates of commercially-targeted sailfish <em>Istiophorus platypterus</em> reduced when circle hooks were used (0.6 fish/1,000 hooks) compared to J hooks (4.4 fish/1,000 hooks). Catch rates of all other commercially-targeted species were similar between hook types (see paper for details). On six fishing trips, three commercial pelagic longline fishing vessels (24.6–26.9 m long) using similar gear carried out 81 deployments targeting swordfish <em>Xiphias gladius</em> and bigeye tuna <em>Thunnus obseus</em> (11–15 deployments/trip) in August 2006–January 2007. Circle hooks (size 18/0, 0◦ offset) and traditional J-style hooks (size 9/0, 10◦ offset) were alternated along the mainline (50,170 hooks in total, divided equally between circle and J-hooks). Hooks were baited with squid <em>Illex</em> sp. and lit with battery-run light attractants. Lines were deployed overnight.</p>",

Unwanted catch of sea turtles was reduced when circle hooks were used compared to J-hooks in mahi mahi <em>Coryphaena hippurus</em> fisheries in Ecuador (circle: 1.3–1.6 turtles/1,000 hooks, J: 2.0–2.2) and Costa Rica (circle: 2.3, J: 2.9) and in combined tuna <em>Thunnus albacares</em>, billfish (Istiophoridae and Xiphiidae) and shark fisheries in Ecuador (circle: 0.6, J: 1.3), Costa Rica (circle: 0.4–1.5, J: 1.3–1.5) and Panama (circle: 0.9, J: 2.0). The effect on target fish species was mixed; in three comparisons circle hooks increased catch, in three they reduced catch and in one there was no difference (see original paper for details). A voluntary program to test use of circle hooks instead of traditional J-hooks began in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in 2004. Unwanted catch of sea turtles was compared between circle hooks (sizes: 14/0–18/0) and traditional J-hooks (J-style or tuna) in mahi mahi fisheries (Ecuador: 2 fisheries; Costa Rica: 1 fishery) and combined tuna, billfish and shark fisheries (Ecuador: 1 fishery; Panama: 1 fishery; Costa Rica: 2 fisheries). Hook sizes, baits, vessels and longline materials varied between fisheries (see original paper). Hook types were placed alternately along the long lines. A total of 3,126 longline deployments were made (328,523 total J-hooks; 401,839 total circle hooks).</p>",

When squid was used as bait, the catch of all turtles was lower when using non-offset circle hooks (0.7 turtles/1,000 hooks) and offset circle hooks (0.6 turtles/1,000 hooks) compared to J-hooks (1.7 turtles/1,000 hooks). Total turtle catch was similar when mackerel bait was used (non-offset circle: 0.2 turtles/1,000 hooks; offset circle: 0.2 turtles/1,000 hooks; J-hook: 0.3 turtles/1,000 hooks). This pattern was observed for both leatherback and loggerhead turtles (see original paper for details). Overall turtle survival was higher when offset circle hooks were used (49 of 59, 83% of individuals alive) compared to non-offset circle hooks (38 of 72, 53% of individuals alive) or J-hooks (99 of 155, 64% of individuals alive). This pattern was observed for loggerhead turtles, but leatherback turtle survival was similar between hook types (see original paper for details). Three hook types baited with either squid or mackerel were used alternately on a commercial longline fishing vessel: traditional J-hook (size: 9/0) and two circle hooks (a non-offset and a 10ᵒ offset, both sized: 17/0; 148,800 total hooks/type). In total 310 longline deployments (1,440 hooks/deployment; 446,400 total hooks, lines set to 20–50 m depths) were carried out overnight in October 2008–February 2012. One bait type was used in each deployment. Turtle catch was monitored by onboard observers.</p>",

Unwanted sea turtle catch was reduced with non-offset G-style circle hooks (leatherback turtles <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>: 0.34–0.50 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell turtles (Cheloniidae spp.): 0.07–0.14), but not offset Gt-style circle hooks (leatherback turtles: 0.73–0.78 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell turtles: 0.07–0.19), compared to traditional offset J-hooks (leatherback turtles: 0.94–0.99 turtles/1,000 hooks; hard-shell turtles: 0.16–0.35). Mortality and hooking location of leatherback turtles was similar between hook types (see paper for details). In August 2008–December 2011, a commercial vessel carried out 202 overnight longline fishing deployments (lines: 55 nm long with 5 branchlines, deployed 20–50 m deep, lit by green lights). Whole squid (<em>Illex</em> spp.) or mackerel (<em>Scomber</em> spp.) were used as bait (one type of bait/line deployment). Three hook styles: 10° offset J-hooks traditionally used in the fishery; non-offset G-style circle hooks; and 10° offset Gt-style circle hooks were alternated every 70–80 hooks along the line in a randomized start order (254,520 total hooks deployed with 42,420 of each hook/bait combination).

All results were reported as odds ratios, see original paper for details. Both circle and tuna hooks were less likely, and circle hooks least likely to be swallowed overall, by olive ridley turtles compared to J-hooks. In 2004–2011 incidental sea turtle catch rates of circle hooks (sizes 12/0–18/0), tuna hooks and traditional J-hooks (see original paper for hook specifications) were compared by placing hooks in alternative sequence along longlines (3.5 million total hooks used in 8,996 line deployments).
