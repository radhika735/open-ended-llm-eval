When fed live crickets, explorative behaviours increased (80 minutes/day) compared to the median of other conditions (40 minutes/day). Four fennec foxes housed in pairs were fed daily at 13:30 h on a commercial diet, fruit, eggs, fish bones and mealworms (only the two males’ data statistically analysed). Behaviours were assessed based on 24 hour video recordings during five to eight 10-day periods. The conditions included: 1) added sand, 2) provision of live crickets, 3) meat was cut into smaller pieces, and 4) no excessive noise made during cleaning. Behavioural categories included pacing, digging, exploring, burying food and resting/sleeping.</p>",
