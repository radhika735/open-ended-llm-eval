Wastewater from intensive livestock holdings containing bacteria, excess nutrients, chemical residues, and solid particles can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings may reduce the pollution levels in aquatic environments, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on aquatic reptiles.</p>",
