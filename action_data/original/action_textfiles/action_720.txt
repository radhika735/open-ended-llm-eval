More natural enemies (for each pest) occurred in regenerated plants than in the tree canopies.

Ground cover treatments provided the highest numbers of lacewings, ladybirds and parasitoid wasps (relative to controls) in spring and summer, but not in winter. The three orchards were split into plots of 0.6 ha which were allowed to naturally regenerate or kept bare with herbicide. Regenerated plots were mown twice per year and comprised a mixture of grasses and flowering plants, dominated by annual meadow grass <em>Poa annua</em>.</p>",

Pest numbers were lower in regenerated (averaging 2113 individuals/year) than bare, tilled plots (3214 individuals/year). The seven-spot ladybird <em>Coccinella septempunctata</em>, predatory mite <em>Phytoseiulus persimilis</em> and green lacewing <em>Chrysoperla sinica</em> were the dominant natural enemies on ground cover plants and were more abundant in regenerated than tilled plots from around early June to mid-July. Three plots of 50 x 67 m in one orchard were allowed to grow natural grasses (Poaceae) and were compared with three plots of tilled bare ground in a separate orchard. Invertebrates were counted using visual surveys, canopy traps and sweeps of ground cover vegetation.</p>",
