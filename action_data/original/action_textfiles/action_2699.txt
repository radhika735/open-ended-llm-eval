The proportion of haddock below legal size (44 cm) was similar for both weights in three of four trials (double weight: 17–25%, normal weight: 16–21%) and catch rates were also similar (double: 52–70 fish/100 hooks, normal: 46–74 fish/100 hooks). In one of four trials however, the proportion of haddock below legal size was lower with double lead weight (double: 13%, normal: 17%) and haddock catch significantly higher (double: 91 fish/100 hooks, normal: 68 fish/100 hooks). Trials were carried out in July 1995 and June/July 1996 by two commercial longliners. Four separate trials were done, one by each vessel in one area both years. Each vessel fished a different number of hooks/rigging configuration (see paper for specifications), all baited with mackerel. The lead weight on sets of longlines was doubled and the sets deployed alternately with lines with normal lead weight. A total of 14,022 and 26,353 hooks were set for modified lines and normal lines respectively. Numbers of fleets deployed, or their distances apart, were not specified. Numbers and lengths of captured haddock were recorded.</p>",

Catch rates of all sharks combined were lower on nylon tethers than steel, irrespective of hook type (nylon: 4 sharks/1,000 hooks, steel: 8 sharks/1,000 hooks). However, if hooks that were bitten off were included (assumed to be by sharks) no effect of tether type was found (nylon: 8–12 sharks/1,000 hooks, steel: 8 sharks/1,000 hooks) and almost all occurred on nylon tethers. On nylon tethers only 34% of the shark catch (n=56) was alive compared to 54% (n=86) on steel tethers. Data were collected in January 2011 from 17 longline set deployments on a commercial fishing vessel. Longlines were made of nylon monofilament (3.5 mm diameter) and 90 km length. Each set had 1,000 hooks (total 17,000 hooks), randomly arranged with either nylon or stainless steel tethers and circle or J shaped hooks, baited with squid <em>Illex </em>sp.</p>",

Numbers of sharks and rays caught on breakable monofilament lines were 58% lower than on wire lines. However, tarred multifilament nylon lines (designed to make them easier for fish of all species to see and avoid) caught similar numbers of sharks and rays to traditional wire branch lines (data reported as graphical analysis). The systematic review summarized 44 datasets from 27 studies of the effects of various actions to reduce unwanted shark and ray catch, and identified one study comparing breakable monofilament nylon lines with wire lines and one comparing tarred multifilament lines instead of wire lines.

Survival at gear retrieval was higher on monofilament leader lines for two of three species and lower for one compared to wire lines.
