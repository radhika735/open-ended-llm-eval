More water and faster infiltration were found in soils that were tilled at slower speeds. <strong>Water use:</strong> Crops used water more efficiently in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (7.78 vs 7.14 kg grain/ha/mm rainfall). Crops used water less efficiently in plots that were tilled to 15 cm depth, compared to 20–25 cm depth (8.35 vs 9.22–9.23 kg grain/ha/mm rainfall). <strong>Water availability:</strong> More water was found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (67 vs 43 mm). Similar amounts of water were found in soils that were tilled to different depths (15–25 cm depth: 66–68 mm water). Less runoff was found in plots with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (10 vs 11 mm runoff). More runoff was found in plots that were tilled to 15 cm depth, compared to 20–25 cm depth (9.4 vs 8.5–8.6 mm runoff). Faster infiltration rates were found in soils with reduced tillage, compared to conventional tillage (7 vs 6 cm/hour). Faster infiltration rates were found in soils that were tilled to 20 cm depth, compared to 25 cm depth (8.2 vs 7.7 cm/hour), but similar infiltration rates were found in soils that were tilled to 15 cm or 25 cm depth (7.9 vs 7.7 cm/hour). <strong>Implementation options:</strong> No differences in water use or runoff water were found in plots that were tilled at different tractor speeds (8.39–9.26 kg grain/ha/mm rainfall, 8.6–9.2 mm runoff). More water was found in soils that were tilled at slower tractor speeds (0.69–1.25 m/s: 67–69 mm water), compared to the fastest speed (1.53 m/s: 65 mm water). Faster infiltration rates were found in soils that were tilled at slower tractor speeds (0.69–1 m/s: 8.5 cm water/hour), compared to faster tractor speeds (1.25 m/s: 7.8 cm; 1.53 m/s: 7 cm). <strong>Methods:</strong> Reduced tillage or conventional tillage was used on three plots each (0.45 ha plots). A chisel plough was used for both reduced tillage (one pass) and conventional tillage (two passes). Each plot had three subplots (0.15 ha subplots, tilled to 15, 20, or 25 cm depth). Each subplot had four sub-subplots (size not reported; tilled at 0.69, 1, 1.25, or 1.53 m/s). Runoff water was collected in buried containers, downhill from each sub-subplot, after each storm. Soil water content was measured in soil cores (5.5 cm diameter, 0–60 cm length, three samples/sub-subplot, once before tillage and thrice in the dry season). Infiltration was measured with a double-ring infiltrometer (three measurements/sub-subplot, before tillage and three weeks after emergence).
