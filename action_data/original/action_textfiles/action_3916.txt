However, no caterpillars survived &gt;35 days. In August 2014, ten ant colonies were collected from each of four wet meadows, 110–470 km apart: two where scarce large blue and other ant parasites occurred and two where they did not. Each colony (50 old and 50 young workers with 15 ant larvae) was placed in a plastic box (20 × 12 × 7 cm) containing a patch of wet plaster covered by a flowerpot saucer with an entrance notch. Great burnet <em>Sanguisorba officinalis</em> stems were collected from one site, and placed in water with the flowerheads bagged in eight bunches of 25 stems. Bunches were shaken each morning to collect fourth instar caterpillars, and one caterpillar was placed in each ant colony. Fifteen ant larvae were added to each colony each week as food. The survival of caterpillars was checked every 1–2 days until all caterpillars had died.</p>",

Data on survival and breeding success were not provided. In 2008, ten batches of Fisher’s estuarine moth eggs were collected from a natural population and placed in 2 m3 stainless steel mesh cages. In April–May, post-hatching, caterpillars were placed in cages containing one or two potted hog’s fennel <em>Peucedanum officinale</em> plants, with 1–2 caterpillars/cage. In September–October, as adults, they were placed in cages containing a potted hog’s fennel plant and coarse grass to mate and lay eggs (numbers/cage not provided). In March, some eggs were placed in pots in a cold frame until they hatched and used to continue the captive breeding programme and some were translocated to six sites in Essex as part of a reintroduction plan (proportions of eggs kept and reintroduced not provided). Every three years after 2008, eggs were collected from the original donor site to supplement the captive-bred population (numbers of eggs not provided).</p>",

A population of monarchs was bred in captivity for 12 generations. However, more caterpillars fed on butterfly milkweed <em>Asclepias tuberosa</em> (75%) or poke milkweed <em>Asclepias exaltata</em> (72%) survived to adulthood than caterpillars fed on tall green milkweed <em>Asclepias hirtella</em> (31%) or prairie milkweed <em>Asclepias sullivantii</em> (36%). In May–June 2014, a total of 253 wild monarch eggs and young caterpillars were collected. Caterpillars were fed on common milkweed <em>Asclepias syriaca </em>in the summer, and a tropical milkweed <em>Asclepias curassavica </em>in the autumn and winter. Adults were tested for parasites <em>Ophryocystis elektroscirrha</em> before being allowed to mate. In the 13<sup>th</sup> generation, individual, newly hatched caterpillars were placed on an 8-week-old milkweed plant grown from seed. Thirty-six blocks, each containing one plant of nine milkweed species (butterfly, poke, tall green, prairie, common, swamp <em>Asclepias incarnata</em>, showy <em>Asclepias speciosa</em>, whorled <em>Asclepias verticillata</em> and honeyvine <em>Cynanchum leave</em> milkweed), were placed in a pop-up cage (57 × 37 × 55 cm) and netting in a greenhouse. From day 12, cages were checked daily, and pupae were moved to a laboratory until emergence.</p>",

Over five days, the growth rate of caterpillars fed on vegetation from cattle-grazed paddocks (0.12 mg/mg/day) was similar to caterpillars fed vegetation from ungrazed pastures (0.11 mg/mg/day). Sixty wild, fourth instar caterpillars were collected and weighed, and placed in individual plastic containers (12 cm diameter, 8 cm height) with a perforated lid. Caterpillars were randomly divided into six groups, and fed daily with fresh plants from one of six paddocks (three grazed, three ungrazed). Caterpillars were re-weighed after five days, and their growth rate calculated.</p>",
