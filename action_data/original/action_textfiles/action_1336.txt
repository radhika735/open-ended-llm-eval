This is critical for the survival of leaf eating and fruit eating primates that live in small forests, where food resources are lower than in large and continuous forests. In captivity it is possible to adjust their diet accordingly by giving seasonal leaves, fruit and vegetables with the aim of promoting activity levels.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
