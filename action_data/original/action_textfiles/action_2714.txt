        "background_definitions": "<p>Commercial fishing trawlers conventionally use a net constructed of diamond shaped mesh due to its ability to capture and retain a wide range of sizes and species (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, many of the fish species or individuals are often small, immature, or unmarketable, and will not yet have had the chance to spawn and even if returned to the sea, might not survive (Sala <em>et al. </em>2008). It is difficult for many fish to escape from diamond mesh trawl codends because the mesh openings close under tension during fishing deployments (Isaksen &amp; Valdemarsen (1986). Square shaped mesh however, retains its shape better under strain and maintains a larger size of the gaps in the meshes, potentially allowing greater escape opportunities for smaller fish and invertebrates (Robertson &amp; Stewart, 1986). Square mesh trawl codends instead of diamond mesh codends may therefore increase the escape of small fish from trawl nets and reduce fishing mortality.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence for a similar intervention applied to trawl nets only is summarized under<em> ‘Fishing gear modification – <a href=\"../../actions/2715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net’</a></em>.

Data were reported as statistical model results. Results varied between vessels, and in one of three cases the number and weight of total discarded whiting was lower in square mesh codends (35 and 41 mm) than diamond (41 mm/150), but there were no differences between codends for retained total whiting, or species individual categories. For a second vessel, there were no clear reductions in any whiting catches between a 35 mm square mesh and diamond mesh (41 mm/150), but a 41 mm square mesh had lower weight of total retained whiting and lower number and weights of total and retained stout whiting <em>Sillago robusta</em>. For the third vessel, there were no main differences in whiting catches between square (31 mm) and diamond mesh (41 mm/100) codends. In addition, square mesh codends improved selection for stout whiting compared to diamond, and the length at which 50% of fish are predicted to escaped increased with increasing size of the square mesh (35 mm: 14–15 cm, 41 mm: 17–18 mm.

In one of two target fisheries for crustaceans, escape rates (by weight) of Chilean hake <em>Merluccius gayi gayi </em>and bigeye flounder <em>Hippoglossina macrops </em>(the two main non-target fish species) were higher in both 70 mm square mesh and diamond mesh (D70) codends than the 56 mm diamond (D56) mesh codend (hake, square: 36%, D70: 16%, D56: 0%; flounder, square: 28%, D70: 17%, D56: 1%). For the other target crustacean fishery, main non-target fish escape rates (by weight) were higher in a 56 mm square mesh codend than a 56 mm diamond mesh codend for eelpout <em>Zoarcidae</em> spp. (99 vs 26%) only, and were similar between the codends for: Chilean hake (3 vs 0%), aconcagua grenadier <em>Coelorinchus aconcagua </em>(17 vs 3%) and cardinalfish <em>Apogonidae</em> spp. (19 vs 4%). However, they were all higher in a 70 mm diamond mesh codend than the 56 mm diamond mesh codend. Retained and escaped catches were compared between four codends of different mesh size (56 or 70 mm) and mesh configuration (square or diamond), and a reference 56 mm diamond mesh codend (see paper for gear specifications). In total, 84 trawl deployments were made in December 2008 in traditional crustacean fishing grounds using commercial vessels. A small mesh (32 mm) cover attached over each codend during deployment collected the escaped catch.</p>",

Overall numbers of total discarded catch (fish and invertebrates) were reduced by the square mesh codend in both target prawn fisheries, by 48% and 77% (square: 69–382 ind/h, diamond: 287–661 ind/h). For the eastern king prawn <em>Melicertus plebejus </em>fishery, unwanted or undersized catches by number of three of the seven main discarded fish species/categories were reduced in the square mesh codend (by 59–95%), one was higher, and the rest were similar between square and diamond mesh codends. In the fishery targeting school prawns <em>Metapenaeus macleaya</em>, unwanted fish catch of four of the six main discard species/categories were 84–99% lower in the square mesh codend, while there was no difference for the other two between codend types (see paper for individual data). Catch data were collected by observers on seven commercial prawn trawlers operating from four ports off New South Wales: from 42 paired deployments targeting eastern king prawns (41–68 m depth) and 13 targeting school prawns (6–10 m). Each vessel was supplied with a 35 mm square mesh codend with a composite square mesh escape panel to test against the different diamond mesh codends (each with industry-designed square mesh escape panels) being used on each vessel (see paper for gear details). The square mesh codend was towed simultaneously with the industry standard codend on the outer trawls of standard triple-gear trawl configurations. The year the study took place was not reported.</p>",

Average catch rates by weight of total unwanted catch (fish and invertebrates, seven fish species accounting for 50% by weight) was lower in square mesh compared to diamond mesh codends, both with and without grids (square: 796–908 g/ha, diamond mesh: 1,114–1,150 g/ha). By individual fish species, five of the 40 species analysed had lower catch rates (three by over 90%) in square mesh than diamond mesh codends, without grids (square: 1–115 g/ha, diamond: 5–134 g/ha), one was higher (square: 29 g/ha, diamond: 60 g/ha) and there were no differences between codend types for the rest (see paper for spceis individual data). Over 10 days in July 2002, data were collected from 65 paired trawl deployments on deepwater eastern king prawn fishing grounds off the southeast Queensland coast. Four codends were tested: a 48 mm square mesh with and without a rigid escape grid (turtle excluder device), and a 45 mm diamond mesh codend with and without a grid. Codend designs were randomly assigned to one of the two outer trawl nets of a triple-rigged trawl every 12 hauls and towed simultaneously.</p>",
