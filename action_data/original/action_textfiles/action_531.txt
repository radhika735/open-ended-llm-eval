The authors suggest that the only substantial difference between the two time periods was the presence of the feeding station, supplied with approximately one carcass a week, normally of mule deer <em>Odocoileus hemionus</em>. The authors note that a longer study would be needed to confirm to role of feeding in reproductive success.

The proportion of pairs successfully fledging young varied considerably but also increased over the study period, as did the number of fledglings produced annually (40-55% fledging success in 1984-1986, average of 47% success and 5 young fledged/year vs. 50-95% and an average of 75% and 12 young/year in 1987-1997).
