In a third site, possibly as the result of the presence of understorey vegetation, there was only a small starting population of noisy miners.  The reduction in their numbers influenced the species composition but not bird abundance.</p><p> </p>",

The authors argue that the lack of significance may be due to the small sample size (25 nest boxes in each treatment). Dormice were excluded by blocking nest box entrances between November 2001 and March 2002. This study is also discussed in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’.</p><p> </p>",
