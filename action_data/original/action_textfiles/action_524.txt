Five chicks removed from burrows and fed sprats <em>ad libitum</em> were even heavier (365.g) while three unfed chicks with a single parent were lighter (240 g). All removed chicks and fed chicks fledged, 37 of 39 controls fledged and three of six single-parent chicks fledged. There was no difference in fledging age between fed and control chicks (40 days), but single-parent chicks took longer to fledge (45 days). A parallel study on the Isle of May (eastern Scotland) found smaller differences between treatments (removed: 367 g for six chicks; fed: 344 g for ten; controls: 331 g for 70; single-parent: 303 g for four), suggesting that St. Kilda puffins are to some degree food limited.</p><p> </p>",

There was no difference in growth rates between treatments until chicks were 32 days old and no differences between growth rates of wing, head or tarsi. Fed chicks reached peak weights later than controls (peak weight at 35 days for fed chicks vs. 32 days for controls) but fledged at the same age (41 days old). Fed chicks were supplied with food by their parents significantly less often than control chicks. The authors suggest that additional weight was due to significantly less feeding by parents shortly before fledging, meaning that supplementary food provided a higher proportion of food received.</p><p> </p>",

There was no effect of feeding on the rates of either wing growth or weight gain, and, in both years, fed chicks fledged later than unfed chicks (47-48 days at fledging for 32 fed chicks vs. 43-46 days for 32 controls). Parents of fed chicks made fewer provisioning trips but did not change the number, or species, of prey delivered each time.</p><p> </p>",
