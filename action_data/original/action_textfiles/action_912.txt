Fire is considered a low cost method of control and may be used to clear lantana before further management actions, such as herbicide applications, are used (Day <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>\r\n<p>Lantana is included on the list of ‘100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species’ compiled by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Invasive Species Specialist Group (Lowe <em>et al</em>. 2000). It is classed as an alien invasive species in around 60 countries and its distribution continues to spread (Walton 2006). It is an evergreen shrub in the Verbenaceae family and can grow to a height of 2-5 m (Weber 2003). It has a strong root system and its fruits are dispersed by birds (Walton 2006). Lantana tolerates a wide range of ecological conditions and can rapidly colonize areas of disturbed ground and outcompete native vegetation (Day <em>et al</em>. 2003, Weber 2003). It is problematic in agricultural areas where it may outcompete pasture species, create dense thickets and poison livestock (Day <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>\r\n<p>Despite being highly invasive, there is evidence that patches of lantana may provide important shelter and food resources for some native bird species where they do not have access to their preferred natural habitat (Walton 2006). It can also provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths (Day <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>\r\n<p><em>Lowe S. J., Browne &amp; S.

In the thirteen previous years, lantana density had been low and similar in the two areas. Lantana plants were smaller in the burned area than the unburned area. The larger lantana plants in the unburned area provided shelter for lantana seedlings, which increased the overall density of lantana. Plant diversity was generally similar between burned and unburned plots. A 21 ha area of Sydney blue gum <em>Eucalyptus saligna</em> and blackbutt <em>E. pilularis</em> forest was studied. One half was burned four times over the 14 years. A 350 m transect with seventy 10 m² quadrats was established in the burned area and a 275 m transect with 55 quadrats in the unburned area.  Plant cover and density were recorded seven times over the study period.</p>",

There were three lantana treatments: upper branches cut and left on soil surface, all branches cut and material burned, and all branches and roots removed (uprooting). Litter in the uprooting treatment was replaced with peat moss and activated charcoal to remove lantana toxins. There were two blocks in warm temperate rainforest and two in wet sclerophyll forest at each site, each with nine 2 m² plots.
