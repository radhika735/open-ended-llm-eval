Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and gain a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant which improves plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Bardgett R.

Crop yields in okra <em>Hibiscus esculentus</em>, pea <em>Pisum sativa</em> and cowpea <em>Vigna unguiculata</em> increased when bacteria (33, 25 and 8 kg/ha, respectively) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (40, 28 and 11 kg/ha) were added, compared to the control (22, 21, and 4 kg/ha).  Three crops were grown in rotation: okra<em>, </em>pea<em> </em>and<em> </em>cowpea. Each plot was 16 m<sup>2</sup>. AMF <em>Glomus intraradices</em> and a bacterium species <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> were added to the soil as treatments. Only crop residues were added during the experiment. There were three replicates. Soil samples were taken and soil microbe numbers were measured. The effect of rotation was not reported.</p><p> </p>",
