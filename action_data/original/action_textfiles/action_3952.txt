In plots where trees were removed, the survival of Appalachian brown eggs (12–36%) was not significantly different to plots where trees remained (56–74%), but the survival of caterpillars and pupae was lower (trees removed: 7%; trees remained: 20%). In plots where trees were removed and artificial dams were installed, both egg (33–42%) and caterpillar and pupal (14%) survival were similar to plots where trees remained and artificial dams were not installed (egg: 56–74%; caterpillars and pupae: 20%). In May 2011, four 30 × 30 m plots in each of four blocks were randomly assigned to four treatments: manual removal of 90% of trees, installation of temporary dams, tree removal and dam installation, and no manipulation. The 0.5-m high dams spanned the downstream edge of their plot. From 15 May–15 June and 7 July–7 August 2012, a potted sedge <em>Carex mitchelliana</em> plant was placed in the centre of each plot. Each plant had a known number of butterfly eggs, laid by caged wild-caught females prior to placement. The number of eggs on each plant which survived after 48 hours was counted. In addition, in each of three arenas/plot (created from polyethylene food drums), centred on mature sedge, five captive-reared caterpillars (first to third instar) were released and the number of emerging adults was counted.</p>",
