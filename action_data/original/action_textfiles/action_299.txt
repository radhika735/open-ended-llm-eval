The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Moreno et al. 1996 describe the highest bycatch rates of a series of voyages coming from a vessel that piped offal overboard on the same side that the line was being set. However, other studies suggest that piping offal overboard from a different point to where the lines are being set will reduce bycatch, as birds spend their time eating the offal, rather than attempting to take bait.</p>\r\n<p>Moreno, C.A., Rubilar, P.S., Marschoff, E. &amp; Benzaquen, L.

Caught birds were white-chinned petrels <em>Procellaria aequinoctialis</em>, and two grey-headed albatross <em>Thalassarche chrysostoma </em>(formerly<em> Diomedea chrysostoma</em>). There was a corresponding significant decrease in the rate of bird attacks on the bait for all species except wandering albatross <em>D. exulans</em> (92% decrease for black-browed albatross <em>T. melanophris </em>(formerly<em> D. melanophris</em>), 96% for grey-headed albatross and 96% for white-chinned petrel). Vessels were fishing for Patagonian toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides </em>around South Georgia and Kerguelen Islands.</p><p> </p>",

There were no significant changes in other species caught, possibly due to smaller sample sizes. The authors caution that significantly more birds followed fishing boats when they released offal (significant increases for six of ten species) and the practice may therefore enforce long-term associations between fishing boats and food. This study is also discussed in ‘Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch’ and ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines’.</p><p> </p>",
