Soil receiving 5 t/ha/year of compost applied had 75% more organic matter compared to the control. Mineral fertilizers had no effect on organic matter levels. Soils receiving compost at 10 t/ha/year had higher microbial biomass (12 mg/g soil) and fruit yield (51 kg/tree) compared to the control (6.6 mg/g soil and 43 kg/tree, respectively). Six treatments replicated four times were applied to nectarine <em>Prunus persica</em> trees: (1) unfertilized control, (2) mineral fertilizer including phosphorus (100 kg/ha), potassium (200 kg/ha) and nitrogen (70 kg/ha), (3) cow manure (10 decreasing to 5 t/ha), (4) compost at planting then 5 t/ha/year, (5) compost at 5 t/ha/year, (6) compost at 10 t/ha/year. Soil samples were collected annually in September to 40 cm depth. Nectarine trees were spaced at 5 m between rows and 3.8 m between trees. Compost and manure were measured in tonnes of dry weight.</p>",
