        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Streamer lines are long lines attached to a high point on the stern of a fishing boat so that they fall slowly to the surface of the water. On the 25 m or so of the lines, multiple ‘streamers’ are attached: strands of often brightly coloured line attached on a swivel to the main line. These move in the wind and interfere with birds attempting to reach the baited longline below. Streamer lines can vary in effectiveness with design, and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and some other fisheries organisations have specific recommendations on their design. For example, boats in CCAMLR fishing areas must use a line at least 150 m long, attached 4.5 m above the water, with five sets of streamers attached at 5 m interval (Miller et al. 2003).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Multiple streamer lines may also be more effective than a single streamer, and how the streamer is deployed is thought to be important: if the wind moves the streamer so it is not directly over the longline then it is unlikely to have an effect.</p>\r\n<p>Miller, D.G.M., Sabourenkov, E.N. and Ramm, D.C.

However, in the Pacific cod <em>Gadus macrocephalus</em> and walleye pollock <em>Theragra chalcogramma</em> fishery southeast of the Pribilof Islands, USA, lines set with single streamers caught as many birds as controls.

The streamer line extended 75-85 m behind the boat, covering the longline to a depth of 2-5 m. Many seabirds can dive up to 10 m (a depth not reached until 170 m behind the streamer), so the authors caution that the streamer may not offer as high protection as it appeared.</p><p> </p>",

Eleven repeats of each treatment were used, with lines set during daylight. Streamer lines were 90 m long, with a 69 m streamer section with twelve 8 cm wide yellow tarpaulin streamers, 5.4 m apart, 0.5-2 m long. This study is also discussed in ‘Use a line shooter to reduce seabird bycatch’.</p><p> </p>",

Two studies (one controlled) from Alaska and the Falkland Islands found that streamer lines reduced seabird mortality by 71% (single line), 75% (two lines) or 97% (three lines). An uncontrolled study near New Zealand suggests that using two streamer lines and an acoustic cannon almost eliminated white-chinned petrels <em>Procellaria aequinoctialis</em> diving within 50 m of the boat, but that the ‘boom and bridle’ system of attaching streamers to boats did not reduce diving within the aerial range of the streamer line.</p><p> </p>",
