In a forest restored by planting, the diversity and abundance of caterpillars (119 individuals) was similar to a forest which had regenerated naturally (103 individuals; diversity data presented as model results). However, only 27% of species were found at both sites. Three conserved forest sites had an average abundance of 159 caterpillars/plot (statistical significance not assessed). In 2002, one 1-ha abandoned pasture was restored by planting 39 native tree species. A second 1-ha abandoned pasture had been regenerating naturally since 1992, and shared tree species with the restored site. Three conserved forest sites were also surveyed for comparison. From July–November 2008, caterpillars were sampled five times along four parallel 20 × 2-m transects/site, 20 m apart. All leaves in trees up to 2 m high were searched for caterpillars, and in trees &gt;2 m high three branches/tree were searched. Caterpillars were reared in the laboratory to identify the adults.</p>",

Seven to eight years after planting, the species richness of moths and butterflies in native tree saplings planted in pine plantations (52 species) was higher than in saplings planted in abandoned pasture (24 species). The species richness in saplings planted in secondary shrubland (35) was not statistically different from pine plantations or pasture. However, all three restoration sites contained fewer species than naturally regenerating saplings in pristine rainforest (81 species). The community composition was similar between saplings in pasture and shrubland, but these communities were a subset of those in pine and natural forest. In 2003–2004, saplings were planted in randomly distributed plots in three habitats: recently abandoned pasture, secondary shrubland, and a 25–30-year-old pine plantation. Plots were 4.0 × 4.0 m (pine) or 10.8 × 10.8 m (pasture and shrub), and contained nine or 25 saplings planted 1.8 m apart. Saplings of Andean cedar <em>Cedrela montana</em>, golden trumpet-tree <em>Tabebuia chrysantha</em> and majaguillo <em>Heliocarpus americanus</em> were raised from locally collected seeds. From October 2010–May 2011 and October 2011–April 2012, between 26 and 47 healthy saplings with at least 15 leaves were sampled in each habitat. Insects were sampled on each sapling five times/year, by visual searching and beating onto a 1 × 1 m<sup>2</sup> sheet. The search time and number of hits were determined based on the leaf area of the sapling (see paper for details).</p>",

Milkweed patches in meadows (7–45 eggs/plot) contained fewer monarch eggs than milkweed patches in gardens (47–109 eggs/plot). Egg and caterpillar survival was similar in meadows (3.9–11.4%) and gardens (6.9–8.7%). In May–June 2009, twenty milkweed plants were planted in each of forty 2-m<sup>2</sup> plots across five minimally managed native meadows and twenty 2-m<sup>2</sup> plots in heavily managed lawns and gardens. In the meadows, 20 plots were located among existing milkweed patches, and 20 were planted &gt;10 m from the nearest milkweed plants. Plants were grown from seed in greenhouses, surrounding vegetation was cut prior to planting, and sites were watered periodically. Plants were searched for eggs and caterpillars nine times from July–September 2009, and six times from 19–29 August 2010. Eggs and caterpillars were removed or marked to avoid double-counting. Monitoring ended if fewer than four healthy plants remained. On half of the plants at each site, survival of marked eggs and caterpillars was monitored over 11–14 days from the third week of August each year.</p>",

The number of butterfly species in replanted (47–102 species) and regenerating (69 species) forest was not significantly different from in pastures (52–59 species) or remnant forest (57–79 species). However, out of 213 butterfly species recorded, 33 were found only on restored sites (replanted or regenerating), compared to 18 species unique to pastures and 66 species unique to remnant forests. Eight sites, all &gt;40 ha, were studied: two former pastures planted with 15–20 species of native trees 12–14 years before the study, one former pasture ungrazed for 14 years and naturally regenerating from the surrounding remnant forest, two grazed open pastures, and three intact forest remnants. In January, March and April 2011, butterflies were sampled once/month. Four baited butterfly traps were placed 1–2 m above ground, 50 m apart, in the centre of each plot, for three consecutive days/month, and checked daily. In addition, butterflies were counted on two 1-hour transects/month at each site.</p>",

The diversity and total abundance of all flower-visiting insects, 14% of which were butterflies and moths, in restored prairies (abundance: 3,155 individuals) was similar to remnant prairies (abundance: 3,315 individuals; diversity data presented as model results). The total abundance of butterflies and moths in restored prairies was 353 individuals of 36 species, compared to 487 individuals of 38 species in remnant prairies (statistical significance not assessed). From 1992–2009, five restored prairies (3.1–7.0 ha) were created on former croplands by sowing 6–12 native grass and 15–121 native non-woody, broadleaved plant (forb) species. They were compared with five remnant prairies (3.5–5.8 ha). All prairies were &gt;5 km apart, managed by periodic burning or haying, and all but one were burned or hayed at least once between 2013 and 2015. From April–July 2013–2015, a 100 × 100 m plot near the centre of each prairie was surveyed 2–4 times/year. On each survey, four 20-m transects/plot were walked twice recording all insects visiting open flowers. The whole plot was then surveyed for an additional 60 minutes recording all flower visitors.</p>",
