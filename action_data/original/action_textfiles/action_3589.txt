        "background_definitions": "<p>Garbage from urban areas can enter marine and freshwater environments in stormwaters running off land via stormwater conduits and drainage systems (Armitage &amp; Rooseboom 2000). Garbage can negatively affect marine reptiles, and all seven species of sea turtles are known to be affected by litter in the marine environment (Kühn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Stormwater traps or grids are designed to prevent garbage from entering stormwaters and may therefore reduce the amount reaching marine and freshwater environments (Armitage 2007).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Armitage N. &amp; Rooseboom A.
