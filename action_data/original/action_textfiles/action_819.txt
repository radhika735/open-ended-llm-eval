There was no significant difference in species richness, diversity, abundance or ratio of adult frogs to tadpoles between sites with and without buffer strips. Amphibians were monitored in three streams with planted non-woody buffer strips (&lt;15 m) and three without. Two 125 m long sections were established along each stream (average 743 m apart). Six permanent transects (25 m apart) were sampled along each section in spring, summer and autumn each year.</p><p> </p>",
