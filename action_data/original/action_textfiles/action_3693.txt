            "paragraph_text": "<p>A replicated, controlled study in 2009 in open shrubland in Catalonia, Spain (Vilardell <em>et al. </em>2012) found that clearing shrubs to create new nesting sites did not reduce predation of artificial western Hermann’s tortoise <em>Testudo hermanni hermanni </em>nests. In trials with high densities of artificial nests, predation rates of artificial Hermann’s tortoise nests in new nesting sites created by clearing shrubland (44% nests predated after 48 hours and 100% predated after 144 hours) were statistically similar to predation rates in existing natural nesting sites (100% nests predated after 48 hours). In second and third trials with lower densities of artificial nests, all nests in new nesting sites and natural nesting sites were depredated within 48 hours. Predation of artificial tortoise nests (three buried quail <em>Corturnix coturnix </em>eggs) was monitored in 36 square plots (of 4, 25 and 100m<sup>2</sup>, numbers of each sized plot not provided) in a nature reserve. In 27 plots, shrubs were cut to 0–3% ground cover to represent new nesting areas (see original paper for details) and nine plots in a natural tortoise nesting area were not managed. In May 2009, nine artificial nests were placed in the centre of each managed and unmanaged plot and, in the 25 and 100 m plots, an additional nine artificial nests were placed in one corner of each plot (total 486 artificial nests). Nests were visited every two days for one week and weekly for up to a month. Predation was monitored by trail cameras and visual signs. The trial was repeated in June and August 2009, but with only one artificial nest in the centre and, where appropriate, corner of each plot.</p>",
