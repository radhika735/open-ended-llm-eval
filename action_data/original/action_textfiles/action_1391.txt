During a particularly dry year, pools in continuously grazed plots dried less frequently than those in seasonally grazed plots (1 vs 2 drying episodes).  <strong>Methods: </strong>Eighteen plots were established in 2000, each with three pools (70–1,130 m<sup>2</sup>) and nine times more dry land than pool. Areas were either grazed continuously or seasonally (dry: October–November; wet: April–June). Before the experiment, the area had been grazed for at least 100 years.</p><p> </p>",
