Reptile populations are disturbed, not only by the installation itself, but by habitat destruction. Leavings strips of undisturbed habitat between solar arrays may act as corridors and allow for reptile populations to successfully persist on large energy farms (Lovich &amp; Ennen 2011).</p>\r\n<p><sup>Lovich J.E. &amp; Ennen J.R.
