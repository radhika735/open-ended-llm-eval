Twenty-four snake species, nine lizard species, nine turtle species and American alligator <em>Alligator mississippiensis</em> were captured in the restoration area. Successful reproduction was documented for 16 snake, six lizard and eight turtle species. It was assumed that there were no reptiles prior to restoration. However, species diversity (in one of three years) and overall richness was lower in the restored compared to natural site (results presented as indices). Planting regimes, burning or herbicide application had little effect on species assemblage. Restoration included tree planting in 1993–1995 (549–1,078 trees/ha). In some areas herbicide application and prescribed burns were undertaken to control scrub. Approximately 25% of the restoration area was left as unmanaged strips for comparison. Reptiles were monitored over 21 months in planted and unplanted areas and in adjacent natural wetland area using coverboards, minnow traps, turtle traps and hand captures.</p>",
