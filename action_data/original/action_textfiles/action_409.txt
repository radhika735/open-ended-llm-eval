        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Ultrasonic devices emit high-pitched (normally above 20 kHz) noise, generally above the hearing of humans, but audible to cats. The devices aim to discourage cats from approaching them and therefore keep cats away from sensitive areas. Two randomised, replicated and controlled trials in the UK (Nelson <em>et al</em>. 2006) found that an ultrasonic cat deterrent in gardens reduced the number of visits by cats by 32% in 63 gardens across an 18 week trial but had no effect over 96 gardens in a 33 week trial.</p>\r\n<p>Nelson, S.H., Evans, A.D. &amp; Bradbury, R.B.
