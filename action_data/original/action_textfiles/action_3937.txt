In plantations of native trees, both the abundance (17 individuals) and species richness (6 species) of butterflies were similar to plantations of non-native trees (abundance: 5–20 individuals; richness: 1–7 species). However, plantations generally had a higher abundance (16 individuals) and species richness (5 species) of butterflies than old growth forest (abundance: 11 individuals; richness: 4 species). Five established (&gt;20 years old) single species plantations (average size 4.3 ha) of each of three tree species were surveyed: Cedro espino <em>Pachira quinata</em> (native), teak <em>Tectona grandis</em> (non-native) and <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em> (non-native). During 2014, butterflies were surveyed in four months (March: wet season; and May, September, November: all dry season). Each month, 10 surveys were conducted along a 100-m trail in each plantation, and three surveys were conducted along ten 500-m trails in old growth forest.</p>",
