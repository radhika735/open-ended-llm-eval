Similar levels of lice were found in wrasse stocked cages and those chemically treated with a pesticide. Infestation levels were on average five lice per fish. Cleaner wrasse were as effective as chemical treatment at wrasse: salmon ratios as low as 1:250. The first farm used eleven ‘Polar Circle’ cages (12m depth, 20m diameter). One cage was stocked with 188 cleaner wrasse and 47,000 salmon smolts. All other cages were given chemical treatment for the duration of the study. At the second farm, two groups of eight square ‘Turmec’ cages (10m depth, 10m width) were stocked with 5,000- 8,000 salmon smolts each. Eight cages were stocked with 500-800 cleaner wrasse. The remaining cages were chemically treated for sea lice. On both farms, random samples of 15 salmon were removed from each cage every 1-2 weeks to monitor lice infestation levels.</p><p> </p>",

When compared to control cages, the wrasse controlled infestation levels, preventing an outbreak on only one of the seven sampling periods. Each of five circular salmon cages (50-70m circumference, 10m depth) was stocked with between 13,000 and 24,000 salmon smolts. Wrasse were added to four cages at wrasse: salmon ratios between 1:37 and 1:49. Wrasse were not added to the control cage.</p><p> </p>",
