There was no significant difference between average numbers in grazed and ungrazed plots for toadlets (13 vs 13) or adults (5 vs 5). Total common toad <em>Bufo bufo</em> numbers were lower in grazed compared to ungrazed plots and surroundings (1 vs 11). Four plots (20 x 20 m) of each of four habitats were established: grassy clearfell, sandy clearfell, heath and moss habitat. Two plots of each were grazed in May–September by highland cattle (1 adult/3 ha). Captive-reared natterjack toadlets were released onto each square in summer, 75 in 1992 and 20 in 1993.

Ponds with successful breeding remained similar (28–34). In 2000–2004, numbers dropped and small populations were lost due to insufficient grazing. In 1987–1993, cattle grazing was reintroduced to 111 ha of coastal meadows on six islands and continued on a further 10. From 1990, farmers could get financial support from EU agri-environmental schemes. In addition, 31 ponds were created and 31 restored by removing reeds on 16 islands.

Although not significant, species richness tended to decline faster during season-long stocking than during intensive-early stocking. Authors considered that strong conclusions could not be reached because of confounding effects of changes in both grazing and burning. From 1989 to 1998, the ranch was managed with traditional season-long stocking (0.6 cattle/ha) with burning in alternate years. From 1999, management changed to intensive-early stocking (1.0 cattle/ha) for three months from late spring combined with annual burning.

Populations declined at unmanaged sites. Individual types of habitat management (aquatic, terrestrial or common toad <em>Bufo bufo</em> management) did not significantly affect trends, but length of management did. Overall, five of the 20 sites showed positive population trends, five showed negative trends and 10 showed no significant trend. Data on populations (egg string counts) and management activities over 11–21 years were obtained from the Natterjack Toad Site Register. Habitat management was undertaken at seven sites. Management varied between sites, but included introduction of grazing, pond creation, adding lime to acidic ponds, maintaining water levels and vegetation clearance. Translocations were also undertaken at seven of the 20 sites using wild-sourced (including head-started) or captive-bred toads.</p><p> </p>",
