In 1991, the rate of parasitism was again lower for nests with artificial eggs added but was not significantly different (6% of 40 and 16% of 25 of nests parasitized respectively). The authors suggest this may be due to the small sample size in 1991. Artificial egg size (26.1 x 17.2 mm, resembling blackbird eggs vs. 20.1 x 16.1 mm, resembling cowbird eggs) or the use of artificial or real cowbird eggs did not affect parasitism rates. Adding eggs did not alter clutch size or hatching success of blackbirds (average clutch size of 3.8 eggs/clutch for 97 experimental nests vs. 3.7 eggs/clutch for 79 controls; average hatching success of nests that hatched at least one egg: 3.2 eggs/nest for 48 experimental nests vs. 3.1 eggs/nest for 42 controls).</p><p> </p>",
