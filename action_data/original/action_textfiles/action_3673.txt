Before-and-after comparisons were not statistically tested. In the four years following mouse eradication, the number of McGregor's skinks <em>Cyclodina macgregori</em> increased from one capture/100 trap nights in the year after eradication to 10 captures/100 trap nights three years after eradication. Numbers prior to eradication had been six captures (four years before), 8 captures (2–3 years before) and one capture/100 trap nights (one years before). Common gecko <em>Hoplodactylus maculatus</em> captures increased following eradication (after: 35–70 captures/100 trap nights; before: 5–15). Numbers captured remained similar for common skinks <em>Leiolopisma nigriplantare polychroma</em> (after: 6–10 captures/100 trap nights; before: 9–21) and copper skinks <em>Cyclodina aenea</em> (after: 2–4 captures/100 trap nights; before: 1–9). In 1989–1990, mouse eradication was carried out by distributing poison baits (Storm, Talon 20P, Talon 50W) via two aerial drops and ground baiting (over 5,000 stations in 25 m). In 1986–1987, cattle were also removed from the island. In 1985–1993, lizards were trapped annually (3–8 sessions/year; 2–4 days trapping/session) using pitfall traps (582–4,066 trap nights/session) that were deployed across 27 trapping stations around the island.  </p>",

The effects of predator and herbivore control cannot be separated. In forest sites, lizard numbers remained stable for five years following eradication (1986–1991: 2 lizards/100 trap days) before increasing suddenly (1992–1993: 16 lizards/100 trap days), and in coastal sites there was a gradual increase from the year of eradication (3 lizards/100 trap nights) to six years after eradication (70 lizards/100 trap nights).

Rats and rabbits were eradicated in 1986–1987 from one island (rodenticide and shooting) and a nearby island was historically free of invasive mammals. Lizards were counted using pitfall traps along four transects (20 traps/transect, two each in coastal and forested areas) on the removal island (March and November 1986–1993), and on the predator free island (November 1986–1992).</p>",

The number of geckos and skinks were similar in areas with cat and fox control, fox control only or no control (geckos: 1–2 individuals/trap grid; skinks: 2 individuals/trap grid). Dragon lizard numbers were lower in areas with greater predator control (cat and fox control: 2 individuals/trap grid; fox control only: 5 individuals/trap grid; no predator control: 7 individuals/trap grid). In areas with predator control, there was no clear change in reptile numbers from before control began (0–24 individuals/group/year) compared to the three years after control began (0–12 individuals/group/year). In 1991, a mainland peninsula was divided into three areas: one area (12 km<sup>2</sup>) where cats and foxes were controlled (using electrified fencing, poison baiting, or secondary poisoning by poisoning European rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>, trapping or shooting); one area (120–200 km<sup>2</sup>) where foxes were controlled by baiting but cats were not targeted; and one area where no control occurred. Reptiles were monitored with six pitfall-trap and drift fence grids in each area (18 in total). Each grid had eight pitfall traps, 30–50 m apart. Sampling was conducted over three consecutive days in March–April and June–July in 1990–1994 in predator control areas and 1992–1994 in the area without predator control. Reptiles captured included dragon lizards, skinks, geckos, snakes, and a species of monitor lizard and blind snake but only species that could be toe clipped (dragon lizards, skinks and geckos) were included in analysis.</p>",

More goannas were found in the area with fox baiting (52 individuals) compared to the un-baited area (9 individuals). Overall, small lizard abundance was similar between the baited area (0.4 lizards/trap) and un-baited area (0.5 lizards/trap), but in one of three habitat types lizards were less abundant in the baited (0.2/trap) compared to un-baited area (0.4/trap).

No statistical tests were carried out. The snake population doubled in 2 years after rat eradication compared to before eradication (pre-eradication population estimate: 51 snakes; 2 years post-eradication estimate: 115 snakes) and, although there were between year fluctuations, the snake population remained greater than pre-eradication (population estimates 2–9 years post-eradication: 78–161 snakes). The author reported rat eradication took place on Great Bird Island (10 ha) over three weeks in late 1995. The island was checked monthly for signs of rats after the eradication program ended. In total, 730 bait stations with the rodenticide brodifacoum dispensed in wax blocks were placed in a 10 x 10 m grid across the whole island. Rats were also eradicated from two neighbouring islands. Snakes were surveyed over six weeks in 1995 before rat eradication and annually after rat eradication in 1997–2004. Snake population estimates were calculated using mark-recapture of individual snakes. Rat eradication programme details were sourced from an associated article (Daltry 2006).</p><p><sup>Daltry J.

Authors reported that post-release survival was higher for skinks released with no mice present (44%) compared to survival of skinks released just prior to reinvasion by mice (15%). Survival of established skinks (2 years after their release) after the mouse reinvasion was higher (91%) than for newly released skinks in the presence of mice (17%). In 2009, a 0.3 ha area was enclosed within a mammal resistant fence (1.9 m high) and over a six-month period, all mammals inside the enclosure were eradicated using a range of baited traps. After eradication, 12 captive-bred adult skinks were released in the enclosure following eight weeks in quarantine. In 2011, an additional 16 skinks were quarantined and released. House mice reinvaded during 2012 and were again eradicated using live capture traps and poison bait stations. In 2009–2012, starting 7–10 days after release, skinks were monitored every 15 days by a walking survey of the enclosure.</p>",
