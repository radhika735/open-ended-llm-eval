These tend to be constructed for mammals but could also be designed for or used by reptiles.</p>\r\n<p>Wildlife overpasses are constructed to provide safe road and rail crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different structures can be used as overpasses including purpose-built “green bridges”, on which natural vegetation is established, through to general purpose crossing structures that are accessible to both wildlife and vehicles. Overpasses are often used in combination with wildlife barriers that prevent animals accessing the road and which funnel animals toward the overpasses (see <a href=\"../../actions/3507\"><em>Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways</em></a>). Studies summarized within this intervention cover both overpasses created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes but where information about use of such structures by reptiles is included. Studies mostly report on the use of such structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.</p>\r\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../../actions/3508\"><em>Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads/railways</em></a>.</p>",

Reptile use of overpasses was relatively lower than underpasses (results reported as model outputs, see original paper). Two overpasses (small roads) crossing a 25 km section of a high-speed railway were monitored. The railway was fenced with wire netting on both sides to limit access to the rails. To monitor animal tracks, a layer of sand (3 cm thick and 1 m wide), was put at one entrance to each overpass, and tracks were monitored for 15–22 days/month between September 1991 and July 1992.</p>",

Fourteen of 23 native reptile species found in the area were captured on the vegetated overpass. One non-native reptile species was captured on the overpass but not in adjacent woodland. Capture data over time indicated that the overpass had been colonized at a rate of two species/year. Community composition on the overpass tended to be more similar to woodland on one side of the overpass than the other. A vegetated, fenced overpass was constructed in 2005 and planted with native vegetation sourced from local woodlands. Six woodland sites &lt;1 km from and on both sides of the vegetated overpass were surveyed from June 2005–February 2010 and one site on the overpass was surveyed from February 2006–February 2010. Reptile data were collected from pitfall traps constructed of 15 m drift fences and three 20 L buckets, and hand searches for three days and two nights every two months.
