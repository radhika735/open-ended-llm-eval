Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</p>\r\n<p>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</p>\r\n<p>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the controlling the target invasive species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the decrease in cover of a plant or the percentage mortality of an invasive animal. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an reduction of the target invasive species in the natural habitat where they require control.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>:The ‘harms’ scale is from 0 (none) to 100 (major; this equates to an increase in parrot’s feather). For the sake of this assessment, ‘harms’ should be a measure of any negative effects, in terms of the introduction, establishment and spread of parrot’s feathers, that are caused by the action. We are aware that some actions in the assessment are likely to have potential negative impacts on non-target native species (e.g. draining a waterbody to control a non-native plant may also have impacts on native animal and plant species). However, this information was rarely presented in the evidence summarized, and hence is not present in the synopsis. Considering that your assessment should be based only on the information presented in the synopsis, the category ‘harms’ should therefore only consider information relating to the impact of the action upon parrot’s feather. Where relevant, potential harms to native species or habitats will be flagged up in the Background section of an intervention to ensure that the user is aware that these should be considered before implementing this intervention.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for control of parrot's feather that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the second round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>When you login, the actions to be reviewed will be listed on the:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a) <strong>Pending tab</strong> – where your scores put the action in a different category to the group median scores</p>\r\n<p>b) <strong>Agree tab</strong> - where your own scores put the action in the same category as the group median scores.</p>\r\n<p>These instructions are always available from the link on the left hand side of this page (Read Instructions), and we encourage you to refer to them whenever you need to while taking part in the assessment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Open each action from the <strong>Pending/Agree</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. You will again see the summarised evidence for the action. On the right hand side of the page you can see the scores the action received in the first round of scoring. Your scores and the group’s median scores for effectiveness, certainty and harms are presented. Below this you can see if there were any comments for this action, and read them by clicking on the link. Finally you can see the effectiveness category that the action has been placed in from your scores, and from the group’s median scores. <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree</strong> with or not, as that will be the published assessment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness. If you believe that an action has been placed in the wrong category by the group, select <strong>Disagree</strong>. You will then need to provide a <strong>Review Comment </strong>to explain why you disagree with the category. If you are happy with the category for an action then select <strong>Agree</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Although actions where the category from your scores and the group median scores is the same are already placed in the Agree tab, we suggest you look through the comments for each of these actions to ensure that there is nothing that suggests that you should change your initial assessment.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have opened an action, and either agreed or disagreed with the <strong>Group Category </strong>of effectiveness, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your review, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your decision if you need to.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked whether the actions initially on your <strong>Agree tab</strong> should <strong>stay in Agree or be moved</strong> to the Disagree tab (we suggest you do this before moving actions from the pending list), and you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Agree </strong>or <strong>Disagree</strong> tabs, please submit your review.

Only a subset of actions, where a certain proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, will be included in this round.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These instructions are always available from the link on the left hand side of this page (Read Instructions), and we encourage you to refer to them whenever you need to while taking part in the assessment.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Open each action from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. You will again see the summarised evidence for the action. On the right hand side of the page you can see your scores and the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round. Below this you can see the number of comments for this action – these are likely to explain why this action has been flagged for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them by clicking on the link. Below this you can see the Group Category of effectiveness, which the action was placed in from the group’s median scores from round 1. Finally you can see your ‘Score Comments’ from round 1.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If, after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them. If you wish to add a comment at this stage you can add it to the ‘Score Comments’ box.  Once you are happy with your scores for the action click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either confirmed or adjusted your scores, it will be moved to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to this tab to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, please submit your final score.
