Brown <em>et al</em>. 2008 argue that care must be taken in interpreting the results of preference studies, because different studies measure solution concentration in different ways. For example, they test the preferences of malachite sunbirds <em>Nectarinia famosa</em> (a songbird, not a hummingbird) and found that birds appeared to show a preference for sucrose over hexose, no preference or a preference for hexose over sucrose depending on whether equimolar (i.e. with the same number of sugar moleculars/ml), equiweight (the same weight of sugar/ml) or equicalorific (the same energy content/ml) solutions were used.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

However, birds did not show a preference when solutions were presented one after another. A separate experiment found that, after 40 minutes, approximately 80% of hummingbirds visiting a feeding area went to a feeder containing sugar solution, rather than a control feeder containing water. Solutions consisted of saturated solutions of cane sugar in water and were supplied from a 250 ml feeder with small holes near the base.
