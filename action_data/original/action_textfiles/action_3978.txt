There was higher butterfly species richness in pastures with more trees and with more species of tree. However, there was lower species richness when a greater proportion of the trees were large (&gt;30 cm diameter at breast height). All data presented as model results. Butterflies were surveyed along the borders of a 100 m<sup>2</sup> square walking transect in 20 grazed semi-natural pastures, repeated 18 times/pasture in July 1997. Tree cover was assessed using maps, aerial photos and field surveys, and tree species and diameter were assessed in the field.</p>",
