        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug has caused widespread and dramatic declines in vulture populations in South Asia by inducing renal failure and visceral gout in birds feeding on the carcasses of livestock previously treated with the drug (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004). Whereas, there are measures to reduce its use and replace it with non-toxic alternatives (Pain <em>et al</em>. 2008), it has so far remained on sale. Vulture ‘restaurants’ have therefore been proposed as a method of reducing mortality until the drug is phased out, by providing a safe, uncontaminated source of food for the remaining vulture populations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Other studies on the provision of food (for reasons other than diclofenac avoidance) are discussed in ‘Supplementary feeding’.</p>\r\n<p>Pain, D.J., Bowden, C.G.R., Cunningham, A.A., Cuthbert, R., Das, D., Gilbert, M., Jakati, R.D., Jhala, Y., Khan, A.A., Naidoo, V., Lindsay Oaks, J., Parry-Jones, J., Prakash, V., Rahmani, A., Ranade, S.P., Sagar Baral, H., Ram Senacha, K., Saravanan, S., Shah, N., Swan, G., Swarup, D., Taggart, M.A., Watson, R.T., Virani, M.Z., Wolter, K. &amp; Green, R.E.

Of the 30 dead vultures examined (eight from supplemented periods), 29 showed signs of diclofenac poisoning. Home range size of three radio-tagged vultures appeared to contract when they discovered the ‘restaurant’ (thus reducing the possibility of contact with diclofenac) but two further tagged vultures did not use the restaurant at all.</p><p> </p>",
