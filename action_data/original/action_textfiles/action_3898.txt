In fields with unsprayed headlands, white butterflies (Pieridae) spent more time in the headland (57–220 seconds) than the adjacent hedgerow (4–40 seconds), whilst in fields with sprayed headlands they spent less time in the headland (5–40 seconds) than the hedgerow (18–72 seconds). However, gatekeepers <em>Pyronia tithonus</em> spent more time in the hedgerow (145–900 seconds) than the headland (15–375 seconds) in all fields. Flight and transit speeds of male white butterflies and transits of female green-veined white <em>Pieris napi</em> in unsprayed headlands (male flight: 0.56–1.35; male transit: 0.74–0.98; female transit: 0.14 m/s) were slower than in sprayed headlands (male flight: 0.21–1.75; male transit: 1.19–1.66; female transit: 0.57 m/s). However, gatekeeper males (in 1986) moved faster in the unsprayed (flight: 0.70; transit: 0.43 m/s) than the sprayed headlands (flight: 0.51; transit: 0.22 m/s).  In unsprayed headlands, male large white <em>P. brassicae </em>and small white <em>P. rapae </em>spent more time feeding (47–60%) and interacting (20–65%) than in sprayed headlands (feeding: 4–8%; interacting: 23–33%), whereas male gatekeeper spent less time feeding (32%) and interacting (36%) in unsprayed headlands than in sprayed headlands (feeding: 67%; interacting: 71%). Sample sizes were too small for other species and females. On half of 4–8 fields each year, a 6-m strip around the edge (headland) was left unsprayed, while the remainder received conventional broadleaved herbicide applications. Insecticide was not used in spring and summer anywhere on the farm. The behaviour and location (hedgerow or headland) of five butterfly species were observed. Flight speed (distance travelled/time spent in flight) and transit speed (distance travelled/time observed) were calculated.</p>",
