Animals crossing roads reach the kerb and often move along its base, until they fall into a gully pot. Once in the gully pot amphibians cannot climb out. A study found that 63% of 636 gully pots in two areas in Scotland contained wildlife, of which 91% were amphibians (1,087 animals; Muir 2012).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There are a number of ways in which the impact on amphibians could be reduced, such as moving gully pots, modifying the design of their grills, providing escape ladders or changing the shape of kerb stones (angled or indented).</p>\r\n<p class=\"References\">Muir D.
