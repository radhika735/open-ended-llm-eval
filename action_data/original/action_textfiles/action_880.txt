Many wetlands have been drained and altered to allow for agriculture and urban development. It has been estimated that the number of wetlands had declined by 33–90% depending on the region of the world (Mitsch &amp; Gosselink 2007).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Creation of wetlands may help to replace some of the habitat lost and therefore help to maintain and increase amphibian populations. However, wetland dynamics are complex and the success of created wetlands depends on many factors such as vegetation, geomorphology and hydrology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">There is additional literature describing the presence of amphibians in agricultural and mine-drainage treatment wetlands designed to intercept and process pollutants (Lacki <em>et al.</em> 1992; Smiley <em>et al.</em> 2011). Use by wildlife is not typically considered in the design of treatment wetlands and wildlife may be restricted using exclusion barriers, trapping or other habitat modifications. Therefore, these studies are not included here.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Study ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section.

Species richness did not differ significantly in constructed (10) and natural wetlands (12). However, captures were lower in constructed (permanent: 650; ephemeral: 407) compared to natural wetlands (1, 315). Amphibian communities differed significantly between constructed and natural wetlands. Larvae of wood frogs <em>Lithobates sylvaticus</em> and marbled salamanders <em>Ambystoma opacum</em> were almost exclusively found in natural wetlands, whereas large frog species (<em>Lithobates clamitans, L. catesbeianus, L. palustris</em>) and eastern newts <em>Notopthalmus viridescens</em> tended to be in constructed (particularly permanent) wetlands. Wetland size and depth were positively and aquatic vegetation negatively associated with some species. Captures were not affected by wetland age. Constructed wetlands were either permanent damed wetlands (built 1988–2003; <em>n</em> = 7) or ephemeral wetlands with added woody debris (built 2004–2007; <em>n</em> = 7). Five natural wetlands were also monitored. Dip-net sampling was undertaken over three days/wetland/month in May–August 2010.</p><p> </p>",

Communities differed significantly in deep constructed and natural wetlands. Species richness was similar in created and natural wetlands (13 vs 12). Constructed wetland communities tended to reflect permanent pond-breeding amphibians, while those in natural wetlands contained temporary pond-breeding species. Abundance of individual species differed between wetlands types and a small number of species were found only in natural or constructed wetlands. Two predatory species American bullfrog <em>Rana catesbeiana </em>and eastern newt <em>Notophthalmus viridescens</em> were found in higher numbers in constructed wetlands and were considered by the authors to increase predation rates. Five shallow and four deep constructed wetlands and six natural (temporary) wetlands were monitored. Monitoring was undertaken four times/year in March–August and included visual perimeter counts, call surveys, minnow trapping and dip-netting.</p><p> </p>",

Species richness or abundance of some or all species was greater at created or restored wetlands in 54% of studies, similar in 35% of studies and lower than natural wetlands in 11%. Created and restored wetlands tended to be larger, deeper and were wet for more of the year than natural wetlands. Species richness and abundance tended to be positively associated with abundance of emergent vegetation, proximity of source wetlands and the availability of wetlands with varying water levels. They were also influenced by upland habitat and tended to be negatively associated with fish presence. Only peer-reviewed studies were included (<em>n</em> = 37; 70% in USA). Only studies that converted existing upland or shallow-water areas to wetland habitat (created; <em>n</em> = 27), or restored wetlands (<em>n</em> = 14) were included. Wetlands built specifically for water quality improvement were not included. Twenty-six studies had controls, either natural reference wetlands or historic data.</p><p> </p>",
