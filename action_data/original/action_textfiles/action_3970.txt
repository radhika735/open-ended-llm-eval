Results were not tested for statistical significance. One year after marsh fritillary caterpillar webs were marked prior to mowing there were 17–46 webs/site, compared to 10–20 webs/site the previous year. In 2015, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs in four meadows were marked with flags so that they could be avoided during mowing (at one site trees and shrubs were also removed to restore habitat). In August 2015–2016, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs were surveyed at each site.</p>",
