Nest boxes for thrashers were erected near parrot nest cavities, and baffles and other modifications were installed such that the bottom of cavities used by parrots could not be viewed from the entrance, a change that parrots tolerated, but that made the cavities unacceptable as nesting sites for thrashers. Two benefits were apparent, the local pair of thrashers ceased to disturb the parrot cavity and their territorial presence prevented other thrashers from approaching.</p><p> </p>",

However, in 1991, there were no such differences, (65% of 60 control clutches successful vs. 55-70% for 120 experimental boxes). All box types were used for roosting over winter.</p><p> </p>",
