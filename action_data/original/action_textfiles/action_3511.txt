Five 25 x 5 m transects at 5 m intervals were established in a 2,400 m<sup>2</sup> exclosure with no grazing since 1989.

A total of 82 snakes of 15 species and 136 lizards of 12 species were captured in ungrazed land compared to 71 snakes of 16 species and 182 lizards of 10 species in grazed land (results were not statistically tested). Species diversity was similar between ungrazed restored and grazed land (Shannon Wiener Diversity index of snakes ungrazed: 2.4, grazed: 2.4; lizards: 1.7, 1.6). One lizard and one snake species were more abundant in ungrazed land, and two lizards and one snake species were more abundant in grazed land (see paper for details). Reptiles were monitored in an area fenced in 1976 to exclude cattle and allow woodland regeneration (10,000 ha) and an adjacent overgrazed ranchland (7,500 ha). Surveys were carried out in six plots of each habitat type (&gt;7 km apart) using drift fences with funnel traps (‘arrays’, 6 traps/array, one array/plot) in March 1994–March 1998 (152 non-consecutive days).</p>",

Dwarf skink <em>Menetia greyii</em> abundance was lower in ungrazed (0–0.3) than grazed plots (1.0–1.3). The abundance of the remaining 12 species was similar in ungrazed and grazed plots. In January 2001, reptiles were monitored on three cattle stations (&gt;20,000 ha each) in 29 one-ha plots that were either ungrazed (paddocks where cattle were excluded) or grazed (4–8 cattle/ha). Plots were also either recently burned (within 2 years) or unburned (last burnt &gt;2 years ago).
