No breeding occurred in the first two years. However, in the third year, 17 egg clutches were produced, with an average of 12 eggs (range: 9–15). Three clutches dropped by the males were not successfully maintained artificially. Most eggs hatched and the first six clutches had metamorphosed by October 1988. The average survival to metamorphosis of those clutches was 85% (range: 22–100%). From 1985, six to 14 toads were housed in two glass tanks (1 x 0.6 x 1 m) in an unheated room (7–30°C). Tanks contained rocks, branches, tiles and a small pond and were misted to prevent drying. In April 1988, six toads were moved to an outdoor tank (5–12°C), but were returned indoors in May. Tadpoles and toadlets were reared in separate tanks.</p><p> </p><p class=\"Synopsisbodytext\"> </p><p> </p>",

Long-term stock tadpoles also developed more slowly and had a significant loss of genetic variation. Tail length did not differ between populations. Forty tadpoles from a population captive-bred for 1–2 or for 9–12 generations (different ancestry) were divided between two treatments: chemical cues from viperine snakes or a control. Tadpoles were measured each 15 days. DNA was analysed.</p><p> </p>",
