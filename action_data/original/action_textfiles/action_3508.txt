Snapping turtles were more likely to not choose any of the tunnels (56%) than painted turtles (16%). Choice arenas had four different PVC culverts radiating out, which painted (74 individuals) and snapping turtles (62) could select to exit through. Separate arenas were constructed to test tunnel diameter (0.3, 0.5, 0.6 or 0.8 m), length (3, 6.1 or 9.1 m), substrate (concrete, soil, gravel or bare PVC) and light (overhead punctures of 0, 0.6, 1.3 or 4% of surface). Turtles were tested individually, once/arena. Trials lasted 15 minutes, after 5 minutes acclimatization, in June–August 2005–2006.</p>",

Reptiles used a wildlife underpass in one of 13 studies, and in one study they were seen, but did not use the structure. A database (Web of Science) was searched for peer-reviewed, English language studies published in 1998–2008, using a range of keywords relating to roads and wildlife (see paper for details), and reference lists of any papers obtained were also checked.</p>",

In a choice experiment, only 9% (5 of 54) of painted turtles <em>Chrysemys picta</em> entered the culvert, whereas 22% (12 of 54) moved away from the culvert and 69% (37 of 54) remained at the entrance. Authors reported that the percentage of turtles entering the culvert was lower than that recorded in a previous arena study away from the highway (47% crossed). In 2013, adult painted turtles (30 females; 24 males) were caught in the wild and brought to a culvert that had been constructed under a highway (2.5 km from capture location). The culvert (and highway) was located between the individuals and their home range. Turtles were allowed to acclimate for 10 minutes in an open box near the entrance to the culvert. The box was then removed and movements were monitored to see if they used the culvert, moved away from it, or did not move.</p>",
