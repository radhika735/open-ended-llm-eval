There was no evidence of breeding by 1992 and only one juvenile was ever recorded, in 1996. Eight frogs survived the first year in the rock-filled pit and were recaptured 61 times by 2000. Two of three frogs that were not recorded at the release site after 1994, but were found back at their original habitat (76–89 m). After eight years, 42% of translocated frogs had been recaptured compared to 47% marked at the original site. In May 1992, frogs were translocated 40 m to a new rock-filled pit (72 m<sup>2</sup>) in a forest remnant. A predator-proof fence was built around the new habitat to exclude tuatara <em>Sphenodon punctatus</em> and the area was ‘seeded’ with invertebrate prey. Frogs were surveyed regularly from November 1990 to May 1992 (90 visits), intermittently in 1992–1996 and at least four times annually (over six days) in 1997–2000.</p><p> </p>",

Populations persisted at all four sites following development, although numbers were lower than pre-development at two sites. Three populations were classified as ‘medium’ (peak count: 19–86) and the other as ‘large’ (167) after three or more years. Mitigation projects during development work had been carried out at least three years previously. Artificial hibernacula and refugia were created at sites in 1992–1999.

Frogs increased from seven to 10 species in the first year and then remained stable for the following six years. A total of 18 species of frogs were predicted in the area and so 56% were present following restoration. The golf course was developed in 1993 and restoration was undertaken in 1997–2001. Coarse woody debris was reintroduced onto the woodland floor, endemic shrubs and trees were planted and non-native weeds were removed. The mowing regime was changed to develop grasslands and a narrow band of herb vegetation retained around ponds as a buffer zone. Pond perimeters were walked to record frog calls in 1996–2004.</p><p> </p>",

Six prototype shelters were installed in a riverbed in winter 2007–2008. A couple of these attracted females but no eggs were laid. Following modifications, seven L-shaped shelters were installed in a river in June 2010 and 20 in a captive enclosure in August 2011. ‘Wild’ shelters were checked in July and November 2010 and October 2011 and captive shelters were checked weekly.</p><p> </p>",
