The introduced southeastern European subspecies <em>A. m. carnica </em>also thrives in this area. The study, based on nine honey bee genetic markers (microsatellites) and a sample of 100 black honey bee workers (a single worker from each of 100 colonies), found that 28% of the sampled bees were hybrids. In the same area, 17% of workers sampled from pure breeding populations of the introduced subspecies <em>A. m. carnica </em>were also hybrids. These findings suggest that conservation management strategies for the black honey bee need improvement, perhaps by bee breeders using genetic testing rather than conventional appearance to identify hybrids.</p>",
