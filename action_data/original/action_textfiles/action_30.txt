Restored verges were mown every two to four years, or burned annually, while conventionally managed verges were mown three to four times during each growing season and certain weeds treated with herbicide. In total, 812 bees from 79 species were found on restored verges, compared to 353 bees from 53 species on conventionally managed verges. The verges studied were all 18-84 m wide. Verge width, slope, aspect and density of traffic on the adjacent road made no difference to the bee community. Native prairie vegetation includes bunch grasses, which grow in a way that leaves bare ground exposed and provides potential nesting areas for ground-nesting bees.</p>",
