The effect of different aspects of the management programme cannot be separated. Turtles were more abundant in areas with CBM (321 individuals) than in areas without CBM (33 individuals). For <em>Podocnemis</em> <em>sextuberculata</em>, abundance was higher in areas with CBM (14 individuals/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours) than in areas without (2 individuals/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours), and turtle biomass was also greater (with CBM: 20 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours; without CBM: 3 kg/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> netting/12 hours). The fishing agreement that formed the CBM programme had been in place for 20–30 years. While 13 communities in the area were a part of the fishing agreement, only two implemented the agreement. Turtle numbers were sampled at 14 sites (7 with CBM; 7 without CBM) in August–October 2009 using gill nets (15 nets/site; 215 m<sup>2</sup> nets; 3 each of 5 mesh sizes) with help from local fishers.</p>",
