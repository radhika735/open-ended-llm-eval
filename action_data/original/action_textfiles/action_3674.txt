        "background_definitions": "<p>Predators can drive declines or local extinctions of vulnerable reptile species. Non-native predators may be a particular problem for native reptiles that lack sufficient predator avoidance behaviours. Native predators can also threaten populations of reptiles that persist in low numbers. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproductive success for species of conservation concern.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.</p>\r\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../../actions/3677\"><em>Remove or control predators using fencing and/or aerial nets</em></a> and <a href=\"../../actions/3676\"><em>Remove or control predators by relocating them</em></a>.</p>",
