        "background_definitions": "<p class=\"Background\">If a bird population is at a very low level then removing eggs from nests can be used to encourage females to continue laying, with some species replacing eggs as they are removed. The removed eggs can then be hand-reared (see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’) or fostered (‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with non-conspecifics’), increasing the productivity of the species.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Background\">Alternatively, removing eggs from wild nests may actually increase the success of these nests, possibly due to competition between siblings. Studies discussing this aspect of the intervention are described below.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Replacement clutches were slightly smaller than first clutches (58 first clutches averaged 2.1 eggs/clutch vs. 1.8 eggs/clutch for 45 second clutches). In one study area, donor nests produced fewer fledglings than control pairs (1.0 fledgling/nest for 16 donor nests vs. 1.5 fledglings/nest for 39 controls), but this was not true in a second area (1.2 fledgling/nest for 26 donor nests vs. 1.1 fledglings/nest for 41 controls). Donor nests were more productive in the year before eggs were removed than the year after donation (approximately 1.3 fledglings/clutch for 32 pairs the year before donation vs. 0.85 fledglings/clutch for 34 pairs the year after). A demographic model suggested that a donor population would be very slightly smaller than a control population after 25 years. Timing of clutch removal did not affect the speed or probability of replacement clutches being laid.</p><p> </p>",

Females laid up to 4 clutches/season as a result of harvesting, but clutch fertility decreased to zero by the fourth clutch.

Both recruitment of juveniles to the population and survival until August (eggs were removed in May) were higher (50% chance of recruitment from nests with eggs removed vs. 39% for unmanipulated nests). A total of 496 eggs were removed from wild nests in the study period, representing 62% of all crane nests during this time period. The success of artificially incubating and rearing the removed eggs is discussed in Kuyt (1996) in ‘Captive breeding, rearing and releases (<em>ex situ </em>conservation)’.</p><p>Kuyt, E.
