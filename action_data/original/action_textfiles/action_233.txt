Birds were counted every two weeks in early morning, from May to October, with a 7 minute observation period and a walking transect. The traditional breeds were Devon, German Angus and Salers, compared with commercial Charolais x Fresian, Simmental and Charolais, in the UK, Germany and France respectively. In Italy traditional Karst sheep were compared with commercial Finnish Romanovs. Animals were monitored in 2002, 2003 and 2004.</p><p> </p>",
