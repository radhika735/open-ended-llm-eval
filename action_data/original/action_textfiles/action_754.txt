Communication chemicals of insects and plants (known as pheromones and volatiles, respectively) can be manufactured and deployed to manipulate invertebrates. Examples include the volatiles produced when plants are attacked by pests (e.g. methyl salicylate) and the alarm and sex pheromones of pests or natural enemies, as well as organic extracts from crop or plant leaves. Chemicals are sprayed onto crops or deployed in dispensers placed at regular intervals in the crop. Many studies have tested the efficacy of chemicals by applying them as baits in insect traps such as delta traps (plastic structures hung from branches or posts containing a sheet of sticky paper). Ground-living invertebrates can be sampled by suction sampling, using a vacuum to suck-up and collect specimens for a given time or area of ground.</p>",

Average daily moth (Lepidoptera) catches were lower and seed cotton yields were higher in fields treated with pheromones than in controls. Three sex pheromone formulations were tested (microcapsules in solution, laminated plastic chips and hollow fibres) but average moth catches and yield were unaffected by these treatments. Pheromone treatments were tested in three 50 ha blocks of cotton, each paired with a 50 ha insecticide-treated control. Natural enemies were monitored by D-vac sampling. Moths were monitored in pheromone-baited traps and by counting infested flowers and cotton bolls. This conference paper did not determine whether natural enemies were attracted to the pheromones or simply benefited from the absence of insecticides.</p>",
