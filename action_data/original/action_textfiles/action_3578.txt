All results were presented as model outputs, see original paper. The odds that turtles would attempt to swallow the smallest hook was 97 times higher than the odds that they would attempt to swallow the largest hook size, regardless of size of turtle. Larger turtles were more likely to attempt to swallow larger hook sizes. Turtle responses to individual baited hooks suspended in their tanks were video recorded (each hook presentation = 1 trial). Sixty 45 cm long captive-reared turtles participated in trials, of which 30 turtles participated again when they reached 55 cm and 65 cm long. Trials were carried out in April and October 2004, and May 2005. Modified circle hooks of different sizes were trialled: 14/0, 16/0, 18/0 and 20/0 (20 turtles/hook size, 20/0 was not tested with 45 cm turtles). Hooks were baited with whole squid <em>Illex illecebrosus</em> or sardines <em>Sardinella aurita </em>and either single-baited or ‘thread’-baited (see paper for details).</p>",

All results were reported as odds ratios, see original paper for details. Overall, larger hook sizes were less likely to be swallowed than smaller hook sizes. Using fish bait in combination with larger circle hooks lead to the largest proportion of external hookings (which are preferable to internal hookings). In 2004–2011 incidental sea turtle catch rates of circle hooks (sizes 12/0–18/0), tuna hooks and traditional J-hooks (see original paper for hook specifications) were compared by placing hooks in alternative sequence along longlines (3.5 million total hooks used in 8,996 line deployments). Bait used was classed as squid (<em>Dosidicus gigas, Illex </em>sp. and<em> Loligo </em>sp.) or fish (<em>Opisthonema </em>spp.,<em> Scomber japonicus, Auxis </em>spp. and<em> Sardinops sagax</em>) and only deployments using one type of bait were included in analysis (4,838 of 8,996 line deployments). Information on hooking location and entanglement of sea turtles was recorded (1,823 total olive ridley turtles).</p>",
