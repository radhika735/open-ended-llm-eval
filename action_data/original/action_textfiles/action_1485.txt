        "background_definitions": "<p>Logging is the third greatest threat to primates in all regions worldwide (Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2017). Selective logging is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clear-cutting, which entails removing all trees at the same time. The idea behind selective logging is to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well. Selectively logged areas can sustain primates at varying densities, depending on the logging intensity and history (e.g. Bortolamiol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although several correlative studies have shown that high logging intensity spatially correlates with low primate density (e.g. Weisenseel <em>et al</em>. 1993) and local extinction in very heavily-logged or clear-cut areas (e.g. Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2010), in some moderately-logged areas, densities of some primate species, including eastern chimpanzees <em>Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii</em> and western gorilla <em>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</em> for example, were reported to be relatively high (e.g. Bortolamiol <em>et al</em>. 2014, Stokes <em>et al</em>. 2010). For orangutans <em>Pongo pygmaeus morio</em>, a simulation study by Wilson <em>et al</em>. (2014) has suggested that reduced-impact logging practices, coupled with additional protection may be a strategy that could even outperform habitat protection.</p>\r\n<p>For best ‘Best Practice Guidelines for Reducing the Impact of Commercial Logging on Great Apes in Western Equatorial Africa’ published by the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group (PSG), please refer to Morgan &amp; Sanz (2007).</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Ancrenaz M., Ambu L., Sunjoto I., Ahmad E., Manokaran K., Meijaard E. &amp; Lackman I.

Diana monkeys <em>Cercopithecus diana</em>, spot-nosed monkeys <em>Cercopithecus petaurista</em>, and Campbell's monkeys <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> had similar group densities in low-intensity selectively logged and unlogged forest patches. In contrast, group densities of red colobus <em>Procolobus badius</em>, black-and-white colobus <em>Colobus polykomos</em>, and olive colobus <em>Procolobus verus</em> appeared lower in selectively logged than in unlogged forests. Group densities of all species were lower in heavily selectively logged forest than in unlogged or low-intensity selectively logged forests. Group densities for Campbell's monkeys were similar in unlogged and logged forests. Hunting rate was highest in high-intensity selectively logged forests, moderate in selectively logged forests and low in unlogged forests. However, no statistical tests were carried out to determine whether this difference was significant. Sample sizes were small and ranged from one to seven groups. Selective logging involved the cutting of commercial tree species with a girth larger than 2-2.6 m. Three unlogged sites, one low-intensity selectively logged site (eight logged trees/8 ha plot), and one heavily selectively logged site (51 logged trees/8 ha plot) were surveyed by walking a rectangular 2 km trail and mapping primate groups and their calls.</p>",

However, the authors speculated that the increase was a consequence of a shift in home ranges between surveys, rather than population growth, as most of the species reproduce too slowly to cause a noticeable effect within two years. The same site was surveyed during the day and at night repeatedly and along the same trails in 1990 before logging and in 1992 after low-intensity selective logging. Authors also surveyed two additional sites, one logged in 1985-1986 and one unlogged area to control for potential year-to-year population variation.</p>",

Although it is possible to skip actions, we encourage you to score them all using the evidence provided.</li>\r\n<li>Open each action in the <strong>Pending</strong> tab in turn by clicking on the title. Start by reading all the summarised evidence we have found. Each action with evidence available will have:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a) <strong>Background section</strong>, describing the intervention;</li>\r\n<li>b) <strong>Key messages</strong>, providing an overview of the evidence;</li>\r\n<li>c) <strong>Supporting evidence,</strong> containing summaries of each study that tested the action. Clicking on the link beside the number will take you to the reference details.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Based on the evidence provided </em>please enter scores</strong> for the effectiveness, certainty and harms of the action, using a scale from 0-100. It is critical that your answers are based on information in the synopsis. Your expertise is invaluable for understanding and interpreting the evidence, but please do not base your assessments on your own personal knowledge or anecdotal evidence about an intervention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTIVENESS</strong>: The ‘effectiveness’ scale is from 0 (ineffective) to 100 (always effective), and should reflect how good an intervention is at benefitting the conservation of primate species. This could be evaluated in a variety of different ways. For example, we could measure the increase in numbers of a primate population following the introduction of a specific intervention, the reduction in mortality or the establishment of a new population following translocation. We would like you to score according to what we know about whether the <em>ultimate objective</em> of the intervention is being achieved, i.e. whether the intervention leads to an increase in the conservation of primates. </p>\r\n<p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong>: The ‘certainty of evidence’ is a rating of how confident we can be about the effectiveness of an action, from 0 (no certainty; no useful evidence) to 100 (complete certainty; high quality evidence). To assess this, consider the quality of the evidence for the action. You should think about the number of studies, their coverage and wider applicability (species, geographical), the similarity of results across studies and the robustness of the experimental designs (e.g. randomised, replicated, controlled experiments with a large sample size will give more dependable results than a single before-and-after comparison).</p>\r\n<p><strong>HARMS</strong>: Harms in this context refers to any negative effects for primate species as a consequence of these interventions. If there is no evidence of harms please score this 0. </p>\r\n<p>Remember, you can exit and return to the survey several times at your convenience. You can also move backwards and forwards between interventions if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please add a <strong>Score Comment</strong> for any actions where you feel this is useful. This is particularly important if your score does not follow obviously from the evidence provided, for example if you have given some studies more weight than others because of your knowledge of the system.</li>\r\n<li>Once you have opened an action, and either scored it or skipped it, it will be moved to the corresponding tab. Until you submit your final scores, you can re-open actions that have been moved to these tabs to check them or alter your scores if you need to.</li>\r\n<li>When you have moved all the actions from the <strong>Pending</strong> tab to the <strong>Scored</strong> tab, and you are happy with your scores for the assessment, please submit your final scores. Do this using the link on the left hand side of the assessment page.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 15th of November.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>N.B. If you know about any evidence relating to specific interventions for the conservation of primate species that is missing from the synopsis, please email to let us know the reference details. This will be valuable in putting together future versions of the synopsis and ‘What Works in Conservation’.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 2</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your task is to review the group’s category of effectiveness for each action, based on the group median scores from the first round.</li>\r\n<li>You will receive a spreadsheet containing both your scores and the group median score for each action that has been assessed. Each of these will have been used to put the action into a category, one based on your scores, and one based on the group median score (see Table 1 above). <strong>The Group Category is the one you need to consider</strong> <strong>whether you agree with or not</strong>, as that will be the published assessment. This decision should be based on whether the category for an action reflects the evidence provided for its effectiveness, certainty and harms. Comments made by reviewers in the first round of the assessment are also available in the final columns next to each action. The URL for the evidence for each action is also provided if you wish to go back and check the evidence available.</li>\r\n<li>Please go through each of the actions in turn, and check if you are happy with the Group Category. It may be useful to read the reviewers’ comments to see if they aid in interpreting the scores that have been given, as well as checking the evidence online by following the URL. If there are any actions that you believe have been placed in the wrong category by the group please indicate this in the “<strong>Strongly disagree?</strong>” column. For any actions where you disagree you need to provide a <strong>Supporting comment</strong> in the next column to explain why you disagree with the category. Please remember that <strong>all assessments must be based solely on the evidence presented on the Conservation Evidence website</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Please complete the scoring by the end of 29th of November.<u></u></li>\r\n<li>Actions which at least two reviewers believe have been placed in the wrong category will be sent out for re-scoring in Round 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>ROUND 3</em></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will receive an email alerting you when the third round of the assessment opens.</li>\r\n<li>All the actions to be re-scored will be sent to you in a spreadsheet. Only a subset of actions, where a proportion of assessors have disagreed with the category, will be included in this round.</li>\r\n<li>Look at each action in turn. Each action will show your scores and the group’s median scores that the action received in the first round, as well as the Group Category of effectiveness (calculated from the median group score in Round 1). Next to this you can see the comments that were made by the reviewers who flagged this action for re-scoring, so please make sure you read them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You are now given the opportunity to adjust your scores for Effectiveness, Certainty and Harms if you feel that they do not reflect the evidence well. If you wish to do this please just type over your original scores in the spreadsheet. Alternatively, if after reading the comments, you are happy with your original scores please leave them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Once you have checked your scores for all actions that have been flagged for re-scoring please finalise your scoresheet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for your help, we know that this is a substantial task. We expect that this will be a very influential piece of work. We will inform you when the results of the assessment have been made available online, and also when the new edition of <em>What Works in Conservation</em> is published.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>QUERIES: </strong>If you have any questions about the process, please don’t hesitate to get in touch: <a href=\"mailto:sop21@zoo.cam.ac.uk\"><strong>sop21@cam.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",
