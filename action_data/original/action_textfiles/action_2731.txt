        "background_definitions": "<p>Zooplankton (tiny drifting organisms) is a valuable source of protein and is harvested in the wild for use as aquaculture feed and pet fish food (Wiborg 1976). Fishing for zooplankton is done using fine-meshed trawls that results in lots of unwanted organisms being caught, including fish eggs and larvae. To help reduce mortality of unwanted fish eggs and larvae, an alternative method of plankton harvesting using air bubbles may enable selective transport in the water column of the targeted zooplankton such as copepods, up towards the surface (bubble flotation method). These can then be harvested by a plankton trawl leaving the fish eggs and larvae untouched at lower depths.</p>\r\n<p>Wiborg K. F.

Data were not tested for statistical significance. Fewer fish larvae and eggs were caught after the bubble raft was deployed compared to without deployment of the bubble raft, at all depths tested: 25 m (larvae: 70%, eggs: 98% reduction); 15 m (larvae: 96%, eggs: 94% reduction); and 10 m (larvae: 12%, eggs: 92% reduction). Catches of target <em>Calanus </em>spp. were between 30–130% higher in nets after bubble harvesting. In June 2008, a bubble raft was towed at three depths (25, 15, 10 m) by a research vessel. Standard plankton nets (20 cm diameter, 0.5 mm mesh) were towed for 30 min before and after the bubble raft was deployed (number of hauls not reported) and target <em>Calanus </em>spp. and non-target catches compared. The bubble raft produced 0.5–1 mm bubbles from eight perforated hoses towed in parallel. Full details of the bubble raft design are provided in the original paper.</p>",
