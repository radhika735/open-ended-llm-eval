        "background_definitions": "<p>Marine aquaculture (mariculture) includes the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of ocean-based aquatic plants and animals in ocean-based cages or spat lines. Marine aquaculture produces many of the shellfish (e.g. oysters, clams, mussels), prawn and shrimp, as well as salmon (Salmonidae spp.) and other marine fish consumed by humans. Leatherback turtles <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em> are known to have become entangled in mussel farm lines and spat lines in Canada resulting in fatalities and with the anchoring line of a mussel farm in the North Atlantic (Price <em>et al.</em> 2016). Lines made of stiff material have been proposed to prevent entanglement (Price &amp; Morris 2013). Interventions to reduce bycatch in marine fishing nets are discussed in <em>Threat: Biological resource use</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Freshwater aquaculture involves the breeding, rearing and harvesting of freshwater species in ponds. Freshwater aquaculture is used to produce commercial quantities of freshwater crayfish, prawns, turtles and fish (e.g. carp and trout). As with marine aquaculture, there is little documented evidence of how reptiles interact with these freshwater fish farms, although freshwater turtles undoubtedly compete with fish for food in these systems. Interventions to reduce bycatch in freshwater fishing nets are discussed in <em>Threat: Biological resource use</em>.</p>\r\n<p><sup>Price C.S. &amp; Morris J.A.
