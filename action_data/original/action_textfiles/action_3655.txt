Areas with vegetation cutting followed by burning had similar numbers of six-lined racerunner (adults: 24; juveniles: 5) as burn only areas (23, 10) and areas of more pristine habitat (38, 10), whereas unburned areas had fewer than pristine areas (13, 2). After a further 10–12 years of prescribed burns on all sites, six-lined racerunner abundances were similar in sites managed initially by vegetation cutting and burning (adults: 28 individuals/site; juveniles: 10), burning (40. 7), unburned sites (30, 6) and areas of pristine habitat (37, 10). Reptiles were monitored in six sites each (81 ha each) managed by: vegetation cutting (felling and girdling in June–November 1995, 6 sites) with burning (1997), prescribed burning (April–June 1995, 6 sites) or unmanaged until after 1999 when all sites were burned at 2–3-year intervals. Reptiles were also monitored at a further six sites in an area without historical fire suppression. Reptiles were surveyed using drift fences with pitfall traps (16 traps/site) in April–August 1997–1998 and May–September 2009–2010.</p>",

Eastern fence lizard<em> Sceloporus</em> <em>undulatus</em> captures increased after burning in burn-only stands (pre-burn: 0 individuals/100 trap nights, post-burn 1–4) and were higher in the second year after heavy thinning with burning (13) compared to no management (1). Green anole <em>Anolis carolinensis</em> captures were higher in the first year after thinning with burning (17–18) and thinning (13) compared to burn only (0), but similar to no management (5). Little brown skink <em>Scincella lateralis</em> captures decreased in the first year after all management (2–3 individuals/100 trap nights) compared to pre-management (4–13). Five-lined skink <em>Plestiodon fasciatus</em> captures were lower in the first year after burning (0) compared to the first year after heavy thinning (7). See paper for details of other species responses. In 2005–2008, the impact of six management options (burn only, light tree thinning, heavy thinning, light thinning with burning, heavy thinning with burning and no management) on reptiles were tested in three blocks of six 9 ha plots. Reptiles were surveyed for 3–6 months before management began (564 total trap nights in April–August) and in the two years after management (3,132 total trap nights in March–September) using drift fences with pitfall traps.</p>",

Seven years after 20–22-year-old restored mining forest was managed through prescribed burning and tree thinning, reptile species richness was similar between managed-restored forest (5 species/plot) and unmanaged-restored forest (4) but richness in both was lower than in unmined forest (9). Reptile abundance was statistically similar in managed-restored (21 individuals/plot) and unmanaged-restored forest (10) and unmanaged-restored forest had lower abundance than unmined forest (34). See original paper for individual reptile abundances. The area was restored after mining in 1990–1992 by reseeding with local over- and understory species. Reptiles were surveyed in four plots of each of managed-restored, unmanaged-restored, and unmined forest. Managed-restored forest was thinned by felling trees (December 2002–June 2003) and prescribed burning (November 2003, reduced to 600–800 stems/ha) and two plots were re-thinned in January–December 2009 (reduced to 400 stems/ha). Unmined forest was prescribed burned 3–5 years before surveys. Reptiles were monitored using drift fences with funnel and pitfall traps in 2005–2006, 2010, and 2011.</p>",

Overall reptile species richness was similar between prescribed burning with mechanical removal, prescribed burning only, mechanical removal only, and unmanaged forest (data reported as model outputs). In 2016, five-lined skink <em>Plestiodon fasciatus</em> and eastern fence lizard <em>Sceloporus undulatus</em> capture rates were greater after burning with mechanical removal, but not burning or mechanical removal alone, than in unmanaged forest (skink - burning with mechanical: 4 skinks/100 array nights, burning only: 2.8, mechanical only: 1.6, no management: 1.6; lizard - burning plus mechanical: 5.3 lizards/100 array nights, burning only: 3.6, mechanical only: 2.4, no management: 0.5). Three study sites were selected within a 5,841 ha mixed oak-hickory forest.
