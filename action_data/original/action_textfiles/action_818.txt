Breeding was successful in 10 of the 12 ponds. Toads colonized the ponds over three years. Private landowners were offered payment by the county to build ponds.

On 10 islands with management, green toads increased from 1,132 to over 10,000 adults. In contrast, numbers remained stable on four islands without management. Pond occupancy increased from 27 to 61 ponds in 1997 and ponds with successful breeding from 11 to 22. Natterjacks increased from 3,106 to 4,892 adults in 1997. Ponds with successful breeding remained similar (28 increased to 34). In 2000–2004, numbers dropped and small populations were lost due to insufficient grazing. In 1987–1993, cattle grazing was reintroduced to 111 ha of coastal meadows on six islands and continued on a further 10. From 1990, farmers could get financial support from agri-environmental schemes. In addition, 31 ponds were created and 31 restored on 16 islands. Green toad eggs were translocated to one island. Four populations were monitored annually and others less frequently during two or three call, visual and dip-net surveys.</p><p> </p>",

This was considered by the authors to be the result of aging farmers changing from growing bamboo to crops that were less physically demanding and the low price of bamboo. Before agreement finalization in 2006, farmers asked for double the subsidies otherwise they would change their crops. Some did change crops. Taipei Zoo, Taipei Zoological Foundation, the Wild Bird Society of Yunlin and the Farmers’ Association of Gukeng Township raised funds for the conservation project. A five-year agreement was drawn up with 21 farmers to maintain a 5 ha area of bamboo bush that they owned. Farmers were given approximately US $150 each year provided that original farming patterns were maintained, pesticide use was avoided, fallen leaves were left on the ground and bamboo bushes were watered.</p><p> </p>",

In 2002, a proportion of a farmer’s crop was sold for him and additional expenses resulting from no longer using herbicides and pesticides were paid for.

Adult green frog <em>Rana esculenta</em> numbers in conventional ditches declined with distance from reserves; this was not the case in agri-environment scheme ditches. Farmers managing ditches under agri-environment schemes are encouraged to reduce grazing/mowing intensity, reduce fertilizer inputs, and not to deposit mowing cuttings or sediments from ditch cleaning on the ditch banks. Relative amphibian abundance was measured in ditches in April–May and/or May–July 2008. Ditches were perpendicular to eight nature reserve borders and monitoring was just inside reserves and at four distances (0–700 m) from reserve borders. Three methods were used during each sampling period: five minute counts, 20 dip net samples and two overnight funnel traps.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",
