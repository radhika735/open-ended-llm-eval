The nature reserve consisted of 220 ha of salt pasture, whilst the agricultural land was 50 ha of arable fields. Most of the extra geese fed on the arable land. In addition to undersowing, the proportion of cereals grown on the arable land decreased (see ‘Increase crop diversity’ for details) and no stock were allowed to graze on the arable land after November. The paper also discussed the impact of reducing grazing intensity, see ‘Reduce grazing intensity on permanent grassland’.</p><p> </p>",

In addition, dunnocks, but not chaffinches or blackbirds, nested in hedgerows next to the sown plots more than expected, with 2.5  nests/km, compared to less than 0.5 nests/km in hedges next to experimental grass plots. Experimental plots were sown with spring barley <em>Hordeum vulgare </em>and a grass and legume mix, whereas control plots were managed as silage - cut twice in May and July, and grazed in autumn/winter.
