Approximately 110 kg of fish were removed from the ponds. There was no significant difference between the effects of the three treatment concentrations.

Following fish stocking in 1979 with 2,000 roach <em>Rutilus rutilus</em>, newt numbers declined to below 900 by 1984. No newts were found in an adjacent (50 m) lake without fish removal. Rotenone was applied in 1973. Newts were sampled using a capture-recapture survey from May to June in 1977–1984. Forty-two cage traps were uniformly distributed around the removal lake.

Egg masses of the gopher frogs increased from 10 to 150. At one site in England both newt species re-colonized and reproduced in a treated pond in the first year following stickleback (Gasterosteidae) elimination (2,000–3,000 fish). At the second site in England, although great crested newt adults and eggs were recorded following stickleback removal, no larvae were seen. Fish were recorded at two of the sites within a few years of treatment. At the first English site, rotenone (5%) was applied, dredge netting undertaken and aquatic plants introduced to an isolated concrete pond (104 m<sup>2</sup>) in May 1992. At the other site, rotenone and electrofishing were undertaken in 1996. In Alabama a pond was drained, fish removed and rotenone added in 1992. On Kooragang   Island, Australia, rotenone was added to a pond to remove non-native plague minnows <em>Gambusia holbrooki</em> in 1998.</p><p> </p>",
