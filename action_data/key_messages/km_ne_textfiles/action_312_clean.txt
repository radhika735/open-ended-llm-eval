312: Reduce visitor group size
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:

We found no intervention-based studies examining the effects of reducing visitor numbers on bird populations. However, a single, replicated study in forests in Spain in 2004 (Remacha et al. 2011) found that fewer birds, but not fewer species, were observed as visitor number increased. This effect was largely due to decreases in collared dove Streptopelia decaocto presence and serin Serinus serinus abundance.
Remacha, C., Perez-Tris, J. & Antonio Delgado, J. (2011) Reducing visitors’ group size increases the number of birds during educational activities: Implications for management of nature-based recreation,Journal of Environmental Management, 92, 1564–1568.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
