2067: Use water-based muds instead of oil-based muds (drilling fluids) in the drilling process
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using water-based muds instead of oil-based muds (drilling fluids) in the drilling process on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
