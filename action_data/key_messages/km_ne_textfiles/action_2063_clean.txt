2063: Dispose of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of disposing of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
