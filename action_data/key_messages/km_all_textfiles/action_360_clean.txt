360: Restore or create forests
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

Thirteen of 15 studies from across the world found that bird communities in restored forests were similar to original forests or that species returned to restored sites, that species recovered significantly better than ats unrestored site, that species richness, diversity or abundances increased over time or that restoration techniques themselves improved over time. 
Nine of the studies found that some species did not return to restored sites, or were less common than in original forests.  One study also found that overall territory density decreased over time and another found that territory densities were similar between sites planted with oak Quercus spp. saplings and unplanted sites.
One study from the USA found that productivity of birds was similar in restored and natural forests. Another found that productivity was lower. 
A study from the USA found that fast-growing cottonwood forests less than ten years old held more territories and had higher diversity than similarly-aged oak forests.
