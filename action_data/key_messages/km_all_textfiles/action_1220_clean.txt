Five of 15 studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) from Canada, France and the USA found that prescribed fire increased the density and biomass of young trees. Two studies found that fire decreased new tree density. Eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species, location and fire frequency.
Two of the above studies found mixed effects of prescribed fire on species diversity of young trees depending on the location.
Two replicated, controlled studies from the USA found mixed effects of prescribed fire on the survival of young trees.
