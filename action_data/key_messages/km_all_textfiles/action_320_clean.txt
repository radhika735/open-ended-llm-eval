320: Use prescribed burning on savannas
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

A replicated and controlled study from Kenya, of five studies captured, found that burned areas of savanna tended to have more birds and more species than control or grazed areas. However, the authors note that differences were not present during drought years and burned sites showed significant annual variation, unlike grazed sites. A replicated and controlled study from Australia found that the effects of burning on bird abundances depended on burn season, and habitat type.
Two replicated studies in the USA found that some open country species were more common in burned areas than unburned, whilst other species were less so.
A small study from the USA found that two eastern bluebird Sialia sialis successfully raised chicks after the habitat around their nest boxes was subject to a prescribed burn.
