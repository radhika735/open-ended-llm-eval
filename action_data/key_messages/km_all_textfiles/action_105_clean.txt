105: Control bracken
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

One systematic review found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken      abundance if applied repeatedly, but cutting may be equally effective.
A replicated laboratory      trial in the UK found that the      herbicide asulam inhibited the growth of three common moss species that      commonly grow in association with bracken, when exposed over three weeks,      but not if only exposed for 24 hours.
