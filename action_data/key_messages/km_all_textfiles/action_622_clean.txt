622: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of bustards
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Three reviews of a release programme for houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii in Saudi Arabia and a replicated trial as part of the same programme found low initial survival of released birds, but the establishment of a breeding population and an overall success rate of 41%.
The programme tested many different release techniques, discussed elsewhere, with releases being most successful if sub-adults were released, able to fly, into a large exclosure.
