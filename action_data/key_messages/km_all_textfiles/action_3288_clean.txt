3288: Create mounds or hollows before planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in freshwater wetlands before planting trees/shrubs. All three studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of 10-year-old restored/created freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that adding coarse woody debris to wetlands before planting trees/shrubs affected the composition of the ground vegetation layer, but not the tree layer.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two studies in freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that creating mounds or hollows before planting trees/shrubs had no clear or significant effect on plant species richness and diversity 10–12 years later. In one of the studies, the same was true for bryophyte, herb and woody plants richness separately.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE
 
VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in created freshwater wetlands in the USA found that the average height of white cedar Thuja occidentalis saplings typically increased more, between two and five years after planting, in created mounds than on lower (occasionally flooded) ground.

OTHER                                        

Survival (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in created freshwater wetlands in the USA found that white cedar Thuja occidentalis seedlings had higher survival rates when planted into created mounds than on lower (occasionally flooded) ground.
