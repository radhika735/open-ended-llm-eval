573: Translocate rails
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Three reviews of two translocation programmes in the Seychelles and New Zealand found high survival amongst translocated rails.
All studies found that translocated birds bred successfully, although one found that translocated takahe Porphyrio hochstetteri had lower reproductive success than birds in the source population. The other New Zealand study found no differences in breeding success between recently and formerly translocated takahe.
