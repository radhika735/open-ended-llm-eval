118: Plant nettle strips
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A small study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in the margins of three arable fields      resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species. The number of aphid predators on a natural patch of      nettles was higher than on crops, however there were fewer predators on      nettle strips than on crops. Three insect families, including green      lacewings, were only found on nettles.
