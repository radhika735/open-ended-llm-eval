Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

Five of six studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Brazil, Canada, Finland, France and the USA found that thinning trees after planting increased survival and size of the planted trees. One study found it decreased their density. One study found that the effects of thinning on the size and survival rate of planted trees varied between species.
One replicated study in the USA found that the survival rate of red oak seedlings increased with the size of the thinned area.
