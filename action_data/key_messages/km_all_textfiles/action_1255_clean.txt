1255: Use prescribed fire after tree planting
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Two of four studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Finland, France and the USA found that using prescribed fire after replanting increased the survival and  sprouting rate of planted trees.  One study found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect of prescribed fire on the size and survival rate of planted trees.
