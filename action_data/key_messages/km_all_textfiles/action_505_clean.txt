505: Remove vegetation to create nesting areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two out of six studies found that the number of waders and terns nesting in an area increased following the removal of vegetation, and another found that a tern colony moved to an area prepared by removing vegetation. Two of these studies used multiple interventions at once. One study found a decrease in colony size after several interventions, including vegetation control.
A study from the UK found that gulls and terns nested in an area cleared of vegetation and a controlled study from Puerto Rico found that although no terns nested in plots cleared completely of vegetation, more nested in partially-cleared plots than in uncleared plots.
A before-and-after study from Canada found that tern nesting success was higher after plots were cleared of vegetation and other interventions were used.
