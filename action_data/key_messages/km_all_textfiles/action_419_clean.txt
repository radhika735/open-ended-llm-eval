419: Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by mammalian predators
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

One study from the USA and three  ex situ experiments found evidence for lower consumption of eggs treated with repellent chemicals.
However, when untreated eggs were provided simultaneously with or after treated eggs, no studies found evidence for continued lower predation. I.e. aversive conditioning did not occur. In addition, a study from the USA found no effect of repellent chemicals on predation rates of genuine nests.
