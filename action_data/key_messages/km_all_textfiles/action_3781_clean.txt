3781: Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries): Sea turtles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Thirteen studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting on sea turtle populations. Five studies were in the USA, two were in Suriname and the US Virgin Islands and one was in each of Costa Rica, Ascension Island, Brazil and Cape Verde.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (12 studies): Four of 12 controlled studies (including three replicated, randomized studies) in the USA, Suriname, US Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Ascension Island, Brazil and Cape Verde found that relocated sea turtle nests had lower hatching success than natural nests in six of seven years, in 26 of 29 years, or lower hatching success than nests laid above the tidal zone, or that nests relocated &gt;10 days after being laid had lower hatching and emergence success than natural nests or nests relocated within 12 hours. One of those studies also found that relocating nests within 12 hours had mixed effects on hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One study also found that two different egg collecting methods resulted in either more dead early stage or late-stage embryos. Four of the studies found that relocated sea turtle nests had similar hatching and emergence success or hatching success compared to natural nests and specifically compared to those laid in safer parts of the beach or above the high tide line. One of those studies also found that relocated nests experienced similar levels of predation by ghost crabs as natural nests. One of the studies also found that fewer relocated nests failed completely due to tidal flooding compared to natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated loggerhead turtle nests had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated leatherback turtle nests had higher hatching success compared to natural nests that were washed over by sea swells, but similar hatching success compared to natural nests that were not washed over by sea swells. The other two studies found that relocating sea turtle nests had mixed effects on hatching or hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One of those studies also found that in years when leatherback turtle nests were relocated, fewer were lost to erosion than when no relocations took place.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that hatchlings from relocated loggerhead turtle nests were a similar size to hatchlings from natural nests.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (1 STUDY)

Offspring sex ratio (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Suriname found that relocated leatherback turtle nests produced all female hatchlings, whereas 30â€“100% of hatchlings from naturally incubated nests were female.
