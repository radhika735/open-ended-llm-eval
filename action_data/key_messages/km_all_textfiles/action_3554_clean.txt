Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of adding lights to fishing gear on reptile populations. Two studies were in the Baja California peninsula (Mexico) and one was in each of Sechura Bay (Peru), the Atlantic and North Pacific and the Adriatic Sea.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One randomized, controlled, paired study in the Adriatic Sea found that no loggerhead turtles were caught and died in in gillnets with UV lights whereas some did in nets without lights.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (5 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (5 studies): Four controlled studies (including three replicated and two paired studies) in the Baja California peninsula, Sechura Bay and the Adriatic Sea found that gillnets with LED lights, light sticks or UV lights caught fewer green turtles and loggerhead turtles than nets without lights. One replicated study in the Atlantic and North Pacific found mixed effects of increasing the number of light sticks on longlines on the chance of catching loggerhead and leatherback turtles.
