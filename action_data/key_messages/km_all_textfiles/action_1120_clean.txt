1120: Asian clams: Mechanical removal
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled, before-and after trial in North America found that suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities within the sediment by 96% over two weeks and that the reduction persisted for a year.
A replicated, controlled, before-and-after field trial in Ireland found that three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in a biomass reduction ranging from 74% to &gt;95%, and an density reduction ranging from 65% to 95%.
