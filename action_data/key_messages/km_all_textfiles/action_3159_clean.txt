3159: Add lime or similar chemicals: freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to freshwater swamps or their catchments. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of shrubby wetland vegetation in the USA found that liming had no significant effect on the relative abundance of plant taxa. For 49 of 49 taxa, differences or similarities in relative abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of shrubby wetland vegetation in the USA found that for most plant taxa, differences or similarities in abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years following intervention. This was true for 31 of 31 herbaceous plant taxa, 16 of 16 woody plant taxa, and one of two moss taxa.
