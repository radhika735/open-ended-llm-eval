Abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that after temporarily relocating Hermann’s tortoises during vegetation management, a similar number were observed compared to before management began.
Survival (1 study): One replicated study in France found that at least 25% of temporarily relocated and released Hermann’s tortoises survived for 4–5 years after re-release. The study also found that 5% of individuals died while in temporary captivity.
