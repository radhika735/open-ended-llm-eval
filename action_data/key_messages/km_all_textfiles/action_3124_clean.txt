VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that covering plots with rubber sheeting after cutting back yellow iris Iris pseudacorus prevented most vegetation regrowth in an intermittently flooded marsh, but had no clear effect in a permanently flooded marsh.
