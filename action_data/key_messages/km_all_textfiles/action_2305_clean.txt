2305: (CFT) Soil fauna: Include legumes in crop rotation (15a)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Microbial biomass (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from Italy found more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found less microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons.
Bacteria and fungi (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found more fungi, but similar amounts of bacteria, in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops.
