521: Provide supplementary food
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from Europe found that overall, gardens with supplementary food did not contain more species than those without. However, there was some evidence that gardens with supplementary food in five countries did contain more species than unfed ones, when countries were analysed separately.
