207: Sow crops in spring rather than autumn
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled, paired sites study from Sweden found more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals, compared with winter cereals. A before-and-after study from the UK found that several species bred in the study site for the first time after the start of spring sowing.
Three studies from Sweden and the UK, two replicated and controlled, found population increases after the start of spring sowing, or higher populations on sites with spring-sown cereals, compared to sites with winter cereals. A before-and-after study from the UK found that ten species did not increase after spring sowing began. No species decreased. A replicated, controlled paired sites study from Sweden found that the benefits of spring-sowing decreased with the proportion of autumn-sown crops in the surrounding area.
A replicated, controlled study from Sweden found that hatching success was lower on spring-sown crops than autumn sown.
