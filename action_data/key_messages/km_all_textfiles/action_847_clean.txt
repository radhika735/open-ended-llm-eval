847: Use patch retention instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effect of retaining patches of trees rather than clearcutting on amphibian populations.
One replicated study in Canada found that although released red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, large patches were selected more and moved out of less than small patches.
