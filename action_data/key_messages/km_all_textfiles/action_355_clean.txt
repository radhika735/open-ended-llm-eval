355: Manage water level in wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Of six studies, one replicated, controlled study from the USA found that bird diversity was affected by maintaining water levels at different levels.
A study from the USA found that ducks were more abundant when high water levels were maintained on a wetland site. Geese were more abundant when lower levels were maintained. Three studies from the USA and Canada, two replicated, found that different species showed preferences for different water levels in wetlands. 
A replicated study from the UK found that great bitterns established territories earlier when deep water levels were maintained, but this had no effect on productivity.
A review from Spain found that management successfully maintained water near a greater flamingo nesting area, but the effects of this were not measured.
