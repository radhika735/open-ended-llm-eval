2569: Restore or create shrubland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating shrubland. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Mexico.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies, in the USA and Mexico, found that following desert scrub or shrubland restoration, mammal species richness was similar to that in undisturbed areas.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that restored desert scrub hosted similar small mammal abundance compared to undisturbed desert scrub.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that restoring shrubland following tree clearance did not increase usage of areas by mule deer compared to tree clearance alone.
