560: Increase crop diversity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

All four studies (including one replicated, controlled study and one review) from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and unspecified European countries reported a positive effect of crop rotations on ground beetles or plants. Three studies found higher ground beetle species richness and/or abundance and one study found higher plant species richness in rotation fields or on farms with more crops in rotation compared to monoculture fields. 
A study from Hungary found that fields in monoculture had a more stable and abundant ground beetle community than fields within a rotation.
