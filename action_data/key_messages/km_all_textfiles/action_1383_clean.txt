1383: Water: Use crop rotations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Water use (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Turkey found higher water-use efficiency in plots with crop rotations, compared to continuous wheat, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found lower water-use efficiency in plots with crop rotations, compared to continuous wheat, in some comparisons.
Water availability (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Australia found similar amounts of water in soils with crop rotations or continuous crops. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Turkey found inconsistent differences in water storage in soils with or without crop rotations.
Pathogens and pesticides (0 studies)
Nutrients (0 studies)
Sediments (0 studies)
Implementation options (1 study): One study from Spain found no difference in water-use efficiency between plots with different crop rotations.
