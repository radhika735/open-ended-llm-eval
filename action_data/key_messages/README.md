# Folder structure:

All action files in this key_messages folder only contain the key messages section of the actions (as well as metadata like title, effectiveness rating, synopsis, etc.), i.e. they do not contain the _Supporting Evidence_ and _Background Information_ sections of the action. This is indicated by the 'km' prefix.

- km_all contains all actions.
- km_evid contains actions that have at least one supporting study.
- km_noevid contains actions that have no supporting studies.
- km_synopsis contains all actions grouped by the synopsis they belong to.
