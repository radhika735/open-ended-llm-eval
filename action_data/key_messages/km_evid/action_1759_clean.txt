1759: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Fourteen studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance. All 14 studies were in fens or fen meadows. Most studies examined the effect of annual mowing regimes, but three examined the effect of single cuts. N.B. Cutting/mowing in peatlands with no history of disturbance is considered as a separate action.
Plant community composition (7 studies): Six replicated studies in fens and fen meadows in the UK, Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic reported that mowing altered the overall plant community composition (compared to no mowing, before mowing or grazing). One site comparison study in Poland reported that mowing a degraded fen (along with other interventions) made the plant community more similar to a target fen meadow.
Characteristic plants (5 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens and fen meadows in Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland found that cutting/mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants. One replicated before-and-after study in fens in the UK found that a single mow typically had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants. In Poland and the UK, the effect of mowing was not separated from the effects of other interventions.
Moss cover (6 studies): Of six studies (five replicated, paired, controlled) in fens or fen meadows, four in Belgium, Switzerland and the Czech Republic found that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover. Two studies in Poland and the UK found that a single mow typically had no effect on bryophyte cover (total or hollow-adapted mosses).
Herb cover (8 studies): Six replicated studies (three also randomized and controlled) in fens and fen meadows in Belgium, Germany, Poland and the UK found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs (including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall). One before-and-after study in a fen in Poland found that mowing (along with other interventions) increased sedge cover. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in fen meadows in Switzerland found that mowing had no effect on overall herb cover.
Tree/shrub cover (3 studies): Of three replicated studies in fens, two in the UK found that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) reduced shrub cover. However, one study in Poland found that a single mow had no effect on shrub cover.
Vegetation structure (7 studies): In the following studies, vegetation structure was measured 6–12 months after the most recent cut/mow. Three replicated studies in fens in Poland and the UK reported that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) had no, or no consistent, effect on vegetation height. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in fen meadows in Switzerland found that mowing reduced vegetation height. Three studies (including two replicated, paired, site comparisons) in fen meadows in Switzerland, Poland and Italy found mixed effects of mowing on vegetation biomass (total, sedge/rush, moss or common reed). One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany reported that mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows.
Overall plant richness/diversity (11 studies): Eight studies in fens and fen meadows in the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness (compared to no mowing, before mowing or grazing). Three studies (including two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in fens in Poland and the UK found that a single mow (sometimes along with other interventions) typically had no effect on plant species richness and/or diversity.
