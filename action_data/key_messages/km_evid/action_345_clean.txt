345: Remove coarse woody debris from forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One of two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that overall breeding bird abundance and diversity were lower in plots where woody debris was removed, compared to control plots. Several individually-analysed species showed lower abundances. A replicated, controlled before-and-after study from the USA found lower nest survival for black-chinned hummingbirds following debris removal. 
Some species in both studies increased after debris removal.
