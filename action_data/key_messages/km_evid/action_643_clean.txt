643: Create rotational grass or clover leys
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot. A study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys. 
A replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures.
