Nine studies from North America and Spain found that raptors used artificial nesting platforms, although one describes low levels of use and another describes use increasing over time.
Two studies from the USA describe increases in populations or population densities of raptors following the installation of artificial nesting platforms.
Three studies describe successful use of platforms, whilst three describe lower productivity or failed nesting attempts, although these studies only describe a single nesting attempt each.
