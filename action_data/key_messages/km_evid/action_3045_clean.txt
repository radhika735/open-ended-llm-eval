3045: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. Two studies were in France. There was one study in each of the USA, Denmark, South Africa and Estonia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that annual cutting affected overall plant community composition, with significant differences between cut and uncut plots after four years.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar overall plant species richness. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that cut and uncut plots typically had similar plant species richness and diversity over four years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar cover of plants other than common reed Phragmites australis.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies in brackish marshes or grasslands in South Africa and Estonia found that cutting had mixed effects on the abundance of common reed Phragmites australis after 1–4 years, depending on the water level of the plots. One site comparison study in Denmark found that a fresh/brackish reedbed cut two years previously contained fewer “tall” common reed stems than a reedbed cut seven years previously. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut reedbeds contained a similar number (and, in one study, biomass) of live reed stems than uncut reedbeds, but far fewer dead stems.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (4 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, before-and-after) in brackish marshes in the USA and South Africa reported that rushes or reeds were shorter in cut plots than in uncut plots, for up to one year after cutting. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that live reed stems were a similar height in cut and uncut reedbeds.
Diameter/perimeter/area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in fresh/brackish reedbeds in Denmark and France found that common reed Phragmites australis stems were a similar diameter in cut and uncut reedbeds. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in a brackish marsh in South Africa found that cutting reduced the diameter of common reed stems present one year later.
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study in a fresh/brackish marsh in Denmark found that the basal area of common reed Phragmites australis stems was smaller in a reedbed cut two years previously than in a reedbed cut seven years previously. Only “tall” stems were sampled.
