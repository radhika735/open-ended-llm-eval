612: Artificially incubate and hand-rear storks and ibises in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
A small study in the USA describes the successful artificial incubation and hand-rearing of two Abdim’s stork Ciconia abdimii chicks, whilst a review of northern bald ibis Geronticus eremita conservation found that only very intensive rearing of a small number of chicks appeared to allow strong bonds to form between chicks – thought to be important for the successful release of birds into the wild.
