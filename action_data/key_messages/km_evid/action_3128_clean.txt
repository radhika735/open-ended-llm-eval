3128: Introduce organisms to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing organisms (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA. It involved introducing plants to compete with problematic plants.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in canarygrass-invaded wet meadows in the USA found that plots planted with upland vegetation (after mowing and applying herbicide) had greater overall plant species richness than untreated plots, after 1–3 growing seasons.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Native/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in canarygrass-invaded wet meadows in the USA found that plots planted with upland vegetation (after mowing and applying herbicide) typically had greater cover of unplanted native vegetation than untreated plots, after 1–3 growing seasons.
