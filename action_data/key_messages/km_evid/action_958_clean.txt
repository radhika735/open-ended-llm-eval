958: Create tree plantations on agricultural land
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of creating tree plantations on agricultural land on bat populations. The three studies were in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in Australia found no difference in the number of bat species in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies in Australia found no difference in bat activity (relative abundance) in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees. The other study found higher bat activity in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations or over grazing land. In all three studies, bat activity was lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants.
