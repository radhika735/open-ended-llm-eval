907: Retain crop residues
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:
Biodiversity: One replicated study from Mexico found higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained.  
Erosion: One review found reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced soil erosion. One replicated site comparison from Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties, including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates. One replicated study from the USA found that tillage can have mixed results on soil erosion when crop remains are removed.
Soil organic matter: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained. One trial found this only when fertilizer was also applied.
Yield: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher yields when residues were retained. One trial found this only when residue retention was done combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage.
 
Soil types covered: clay, loam, sandy-loam, silt loam.
