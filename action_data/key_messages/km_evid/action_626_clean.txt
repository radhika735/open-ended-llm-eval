626: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of raptors
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Five studies of three release programmes from across the world found the establishment or increase of wild populations of falcons Falco spp.
Five studies from the USA found high survival of released raptors (with between one and 204 birds released), whilst two found that released birds behaved normally and hunted successfully.
One study from Australia found that a wedge-tailed eagle Aquila audax had to be taken back into captivity after acting aggressively towards humans, whilst another Australian study found that only one of 15 brown goshawks Accipiter fasciatus released was recovered, although the authors do not draw conclusions about survival rates from this.
