3305: Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Four studies were in the USA. Two of these were based in the same marsh, but used different experimental set-ups. Two studies were in Canada. One study was in China.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding fertilizer when planting wetland herbs typically had no significant effect on total live vegetation biomass, after two growing seasons. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that overall vegetation biomass and cover were greater in fertilized than unfertilized plots, one year after introducing salt marsh vegetation.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in intertidal areas in the USA found that the abundance of cordgrasses Spartina spp. was typically similar in fertilized and unfertilized plots, 1–2 growing seasons after planting. This was true for density, biomass and/or cover. However, one controlled study on former borrow pits in the USA found that cordgrass Spartina spp. biomass was typically greater in fertilized than unfertilized plots, one growing season after planting. This study also found that fertilization typically reduced black rush Juncus roemarianus biomass, one growing season after planting.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (6 studies): Five replicated, controlled studies (four also paired, three also randomized) in brackish/saline wetlands in the USA, China and Canada found that adding fertilizer had no significant effect on the height of planted/sown wetland herbs after 1–2 growing seasons. One controlled study on former borrow pits in the USA found that fertilized smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora was taller than unfertilized smooth cordgrass, two growing seasons after planting.

OTHER

Survival (4 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in intertidal areas in the USA and Canada found that adding fertilizer had no significant effect on the survival of planted wetland herbs over 1–2 growing seasons. One controlled study on former borrow pits in the USA reported that adding standard fertilizer to planting holes reduced the survival of planted big cordgrass Spartina cynosuroides, after one growing season.
