780: Manage grazing regime
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads. Five studies (including four replicated studies) in Denmark, Estonia and the UK found that habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing increased green toad populations, maintained or increased natterjack toad populations and maintained common toad populations. 
One before-and-after study in the USA found that the decline in amphibian species was similar under traditional season-long or intensive-early cattle stocking.
