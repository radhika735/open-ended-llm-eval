580: Translocate songbirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Nine studies from across the world, including a review of 31 translocation attempts in New Zealand found that translocations led to the establishment of songbird populations. The review found that 79% and 100% of translocation programmes for saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and New Zealand robins Petroica australis, respectively, were successful in establishing populations. Eight of the studies were from islands, mostly following predator removal.
Three studies from Zimbabwe, New Zealand and the USA report on three translocation programmes that failed to establish populations.
A methodological paper found that the nesting success of saddlebacks decreased as the latitudinal difference between source area and release site increased.
