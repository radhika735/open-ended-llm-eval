198: Take field corners out of management
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
A replicated study in the UK found that overwinter survival of grey partridge Perdix perdix was higher where field corners were taken out of management than on other sites for one of three winters. There was no relationship with the intervention and brood size, the ratio of young to old birds or density changes.
