1807: Reprofile/relandscape peatland (without planting)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of reprofiling/relandscaping peatlands (without planting) on peatland vegetation. The study was in degraded bogs (being restored as fens).
Plant community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in CanadaÂ reported that after five years, reprofiled (and rewetted) bogs contained a different plant community to nearby natural fens.
Vegetation cover (1 study): The same study reported that after five years, reprofiled (and rewetted) bogs had lower vegetation cover (Sphagnum moss, other moss and vascular plants) than nearby natural fens.
