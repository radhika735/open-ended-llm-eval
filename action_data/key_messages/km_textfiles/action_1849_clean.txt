1849: Lobby, campaign or demonstrate to protect peatlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of lobbying/campaigning/demonstrating for peatland protection on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. Both studies reported effects, on unspecified peatlands, of the same campaign in the UK.
Peatland protection (2 studies): Two studies in the UK reported that the area of protected peatland increased following pressure from a campaign group.
Behaviour change (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following pressure from a campaign group, major retailers stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost.
Attitudes/awareness (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following campaign pressure, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements.
