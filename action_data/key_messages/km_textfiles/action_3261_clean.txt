3261: Introduce fragments of non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing fragments of emergent, non-woody plants to brackish/saline wetlands. Two studies were in one bog in Canada. One study was in China.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that plots planted with rhizomes or sown with fragments of salt marsh herbs had similar overall vegetation biomass, after one year, to plots that had not been planted or sown.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that plots sown with fragments of salt marsh herbs had greater overall cover of the introduced species, after one year, to unsown plots. However, biomass of the introduced species did not significantly differ between sown and unsown plots.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one also before-and-after) in brackish/saline wetlands in Canada and China simply quantified the abundance of herb species, over one year or growing season after planting herb fragments.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE
 
OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated study on a tidal flat in China reported that at least 25% of bulrush Scirpus mariqueter corms (bulb-like organs) produced shoots within the first growing season after planting.
