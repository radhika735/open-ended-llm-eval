569: Translocate pelicans
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:
Two reviews of a brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis translocation programme in the USA found high survival of translocated nestlings and that the target population grew enormously, to over 16,000 nests. The authors note that some of the growth may have been due to immigration from the source populations.
