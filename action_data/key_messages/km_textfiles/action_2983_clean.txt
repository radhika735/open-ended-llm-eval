2983: Abandon aquaculture facilities: allow brackish/saline marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning aquaculture facilities with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. The study was in Costa Rica.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond contained the same four tree species as a nearby natural mangrove forest.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond contained a greater density of trees than a nearby natural mangrove forest.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond had a shorter tree canopy than a nearby natural mangrove forest.
Basal area (1 study): The same study reported that the basal area of trees was smaller in an abandoned shrimp pond, after 14 years, than in a nearby natural mangrove forest.
