280: Provide ‘sacrificial’ grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Two studies in the UK found that managing grasslands for geese increased the number grazing there. However, both found that the birds were moving within a relatively small area (i.e. within the study sites) and therefore the grasslands may not reduce conflict with farmers.
