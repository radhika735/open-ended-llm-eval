837: Captive breeding Mallorcan midwife toads
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Two replicated studies in the UK found that Mallorcan midwife toads produced eggs that were raised to metamorphs or toadlets successfully in captivity. One found that clutches dropped by males were not successfully maintained artificially.
One replicated study in the UK found that survival to metamorphosis was 85%. One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations had slower tadpole development, reduction in one predator defence trait and decreased genetic diversity.
