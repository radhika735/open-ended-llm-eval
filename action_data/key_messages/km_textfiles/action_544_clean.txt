Key Messages:

Two European studies found increased numbers of grey partridge Perdix perdix in fed areas, compared to unfed areas. In one study there was no change in the overall population in the study area, in the second there was an increase.
One cross-over study from the USA found that northern bobwhites Colinus virginianus had higher overwinter survival in fed areas, one found lower survival and a literature review found no overall effect of feeding.
