3431: Use erosion blanket after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of using erosion blankets after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one study was in Spain.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were paired and two randomized) in the USA and Spain found that using an erosion blanket after seeding and planting did not alter vegetation cover. The other study found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant density.
