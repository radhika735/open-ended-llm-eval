3118: Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants: freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide increased overall plant diversity, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone. However, burning had no significant effect on plant species richness.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant species richness, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on the density of non-planted tree seedlings, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species two growing seasons later.
