3318: Add cover other than mulch before/after planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding cover other than mulch to freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in Australia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native shrubs had no significant effect on their overall cover, one year later.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting swamp gum Eucalyptus camphora seedlings had no significant effect on swamp gum cover, one year later. Covering plots with mats also reduced cover of two problematic herb species.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE                                         

Height (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that planted swamp gum Eucalyptus camphora seedlings reached a similar height, after one year, in covered and uncovered plots. Covers were plastic or jute mats.
