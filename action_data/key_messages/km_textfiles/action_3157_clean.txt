3157: Add lime or similar chemicals: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to freshwater marshes or their catchments. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of marsh vegetation in the USA found that liming had little effect on the relative abundance of plant taxa. For 48 of 49 taxa, differences or similarities in relative abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of marsh vegetation in the USA found that for most plant taxa, differences or similarities in abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years following intervention. This was true for 33 of 38 herbaceous plant taxa, eight of eight woody plant taxa, and two of three moss taxa.
