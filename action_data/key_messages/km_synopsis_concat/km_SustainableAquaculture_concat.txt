Two studies in Ireland found mixed effects of cleaner wrasse on sea lice numbers infesting salmon. One controlled study found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments.

Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain between salmon that were fed diets containing fish meal only or a krill meal substitute. When the krill were de-shelled, growth rates were closer to salmon fed fish meal, compared to leaving the krill whole.
Feed conversion ratios were found to be similar in both the fish meal and krill meal diets.
The number of aerobic bacteria in the hindgut of salmon fed fish meal and krill meal were higher and composition of the bacterial flora was different.

Key Messages:

Evidence for the effects of replacing fish meal with bacterial protein is mixed.
Two replicated, controlled studies in Norway found similar growth rates in salmon fed either a 100% fish meal (control) diet or experimental diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein to replace fish meal. In the diet containing 50% bacterial protein, growth rates were lower compared to the control. 
Another replicated, controlled study in Norway reported higher growth rates in salmon that were fed diets containing 18% and 36% bacterial protein compared to the control or a diet containing 4.5% bacterial protein.

924: Use an alternative protein source: plant-based
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Six studies (four replicated, controlled) in Norway, Scotland and the USA found that inclusion of plant-based proteins within feed led to decreased growth rates in salmon. Three replicated and/or controlled studies from Norway, Canada and Scotland found similar growth rates in salmon fed either plant-based or fish meal diets.
Four replicated, controlled studies (three randomised) from Norway and Scotland found reduced final body weights in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal-based diets. Two controlled studies (one replicated) from Norway found similar final body weights in salmon fed either plant-based or fish meal diets.
Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomised) from Norway found lowered levels of feeding efficiency, whereas a replicated study in Norway found increased levels of feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal diets. Two replicated studies (one controlled) in Canada and Scotland study found similar levels of feeding efficiency across both diet types.
Digestibility of feed components by salmon was found to be lower in two replicated, controlled studies when the diets contained plant proteins compared to fish meal. Similar levels of digestibility across both diet types were identified by two randomised, replicated, controlled studies in Scotland and Norway. 
Two of the studies found that survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant- or fish meal-based protein diets. However morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomised, replicated, controlled studies where salmon were fed diets containing plant-based proteins. Condition of the salmon was increased in plant-based protein diets in one randomised, replicated, controlled study but reduced in two other replicated studies.
