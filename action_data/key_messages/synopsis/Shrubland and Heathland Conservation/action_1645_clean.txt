Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the USAÂ found that areas sprayed with herbicide and weeded to control non-native grass cover had higher cover of native grasses and forbs than areas that were not sprayed or weeded, but not a higher number of native plant species. The same study found that spraying with herbicide and weeding reduced non-native grass cover.
