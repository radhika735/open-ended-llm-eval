1860: Exclude wild herbivores using physical barriers
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of physically excluding wild herbivores. The study was in a fen meadow.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a fen meadow in Poland reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on vascular plant and moss cover depended on other treatments applied to plots.
Vegetation structure (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on total vegetation biomass depended on other treatments applied to plots.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of boar- and deer exclusion on plant species richness depended on other treatments applied to plots.
