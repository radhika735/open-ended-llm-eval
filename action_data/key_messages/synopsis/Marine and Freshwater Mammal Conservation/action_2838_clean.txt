2838: Introduce and enforce regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of introducing regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours on marine mammals. One study was in each of the North Atlantic Ocean (the Azores), the Cananéia estuary (Brazil), the South Pacific Ocean (Australia) and the Bass Strait (Australia).

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two controlled studies in the North Atlantic Ocean and South Pacific Ocean found that when whale-watching vessels followed approach regulations, fewer sperm whales and humpback whale pods changed their behaviours (e.g. swimming speed, aerial displays) or avoided the vessels compared to when regulations were not followed, but direction of movement and diving patterns or diving behaviours did not differ. One replicated, controlled study in the Cananéia estuary found that when tour boats followed approach regulations, fewer Guiana dolphins displayed negative behaviours (e.g. moving away, diving, groups separating). One study in the Bass Strait found that when boats approached a seal colony to 75 m, more seals remained on shore than when boats approached to 25 m.
