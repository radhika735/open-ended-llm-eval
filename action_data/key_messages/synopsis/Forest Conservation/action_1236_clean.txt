1236: Sow tree seeds after wildfire
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Key Messages:

Three studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in the USA examined the effect of sowing herbaceous plant seeds in burnt forest areas. One found it decreased the number and cover of native species and one found it decreased the density of tree seedlings. All three found no effect of seeding on total plant cover or species richness.
