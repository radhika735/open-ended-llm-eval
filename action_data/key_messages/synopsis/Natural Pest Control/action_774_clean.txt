774: Delay herbicide use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Natural enemies: Two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark found more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed. One of the studies found some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefitted early in the season. Weeds: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found more weeds when herbicide treatments were delayed. Insect pests and damage: One of two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Canada and Denmark found more insect pests, but only for some pest groups, and one study found fewer pests in one of two experiments and for one of two crop varieties. One study found lower crop damage in some but not all varieties and study years. Yield: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found lower yields and one study found no effect.
Crops studied were beet and oilseed.
