873: Release captive-bred Mallorcan midwife toads
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Three studies (including one replicated study and one review) in Mallorca found that captive-bred midwife toads released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that predator defences were maintained, but genetic diversity reduced in a captive-bred reintroduced population.
