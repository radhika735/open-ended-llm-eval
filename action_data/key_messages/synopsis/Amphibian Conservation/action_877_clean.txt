877: Use prescribed fire or modifications to burning regime in forests
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Key Messages:

Eight of 14 studies (including three randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, North America and the USA found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species. Four found that forest fires had mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species, species and year or season of burn. Three found that fires increased amphibian abundance or numbers of species. One found that abundance decreased with fires.
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled study) in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance increased or abundance decreased with time since prescribed forest fires.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that spotted salamander hatching success increased following a prescribed forest fire.
