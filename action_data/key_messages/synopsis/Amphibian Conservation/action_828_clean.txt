Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Three studies (including one replicated study) in Sweden, the UK and USA found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations.
One review in Australia, the UK and USA found that fish control, which included using rotenone, increased breeding success for four amphibian species.
Two replicated studies in Pakistan and the UK found when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects.
