1368: Soil: Use crop rotations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Organic matter (9 studies): Five replicated, controlled studies (two randomized) from Italy, Portugal, and Spain found less organic matter in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, controlled study from Syria found more organic matter in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. Three replicated, controlled studies from Spain found similar amounts of organic matter in soils with or without crop rotations.
Nutrients (5 studies)

Nitrogen (5 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Australia found more nitrogen in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in one of four comparisons. One replicated, controlled study from Italy found less nitrogen in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found inconsistent differences in nitrogen in soils with or without crop rotations. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Portugal and Spain found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with or without crop rotations.
Phosphorus (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Portugal and Spain found less phosphorus in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons.
pH (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Portugal and Spain found similar pH levels in soils with or without crop rotations.

Soil organisms (3 studies)

Microbial biomass (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from Italy found more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found less microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons.
Bacteria and fungi (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Portugal found more fungi, but similar amounts of bacteria, in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops.

Soil erosion and aggregation (4 studies): One replicated, controlled study from Syria found higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found lower water-stability in soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found inconsistent differences in water-stability in soils with or without crop rotations. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found no differences in water-stability.
Greenhouse gases (4 studies): One replicated, controlled study from Italy found higher carbon dioxide emissions from soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found similar carbon dioxide emissions from soils with or without crop rotations. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Australia found lower nitrous oxide and methane emissions from soils with crop rotations, compared to continuous crops, but another one found no differences in nitrous oxide emissions.
Implementation options (2 studies): Two studies from Syria and the USA found similar amounts of nitrogen in soils with two-year or four-year rotations. One of these studies also found similar amounts of organic matter.
