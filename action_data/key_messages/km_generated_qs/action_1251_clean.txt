1251: Use soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Portugal and the USA found that ploughing increased the cover and diversity of understory plants.
Two of three studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled) in Canada and Brazil found that ploughing increased,  and one found it decreased the density of young trees. Two replicated, controlled studies in Ethiopia and Sweden found mixed effects of tilling on different tree species.
One replicated, before-and-after trial in Finland found that ploughing decreased the cover of plants living on wood surface.
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that ploughing did not decrease the spreading distance and density of invasive grass seedlings.
