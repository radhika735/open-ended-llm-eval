Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from Venezuela found that the local population of yellow-shouldered amazons Amazona barbadensis increased significantly following the release of captive-bred birds, along with other interventions.
A replicated study in Costa Rica and Peru found high survival and some breeding of scarlet macaw Ara macao after release.
Three replicated studies in the USA, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico found low survival in released birds (4–41% in the first year after release), although the Puerto Rican study also found that released birds bred successfully.
