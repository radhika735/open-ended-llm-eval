VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs increased their overall cover, one year later.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs reduced the cover of two problematic herb species, one year later.
