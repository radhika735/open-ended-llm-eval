3921: Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
     

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape. Both studies were in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Switzerland found that farms and landscapes with a greater number of habitats or crop types had a similar species richness of butterflies to farms and landscapes with fewer different habitats or crop types.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a greater number of habitats had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with fewer different habitats.
