278: Use wildlife refuges to reduce hunting disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Three studies from the USA and Europe found that bird densities were higher in refuges where hunting was prohibited, compared to areas with hunting. In addition, two studies found that more birds used hunting-free areas during the open season and on hunting days.
No studies investigated the population-level impacts of these refuges.
