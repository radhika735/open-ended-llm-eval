1256: Mechanically remove understory vegetation after tree planting 
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Five studies (including three replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Canada, the USA, France, Panama and Sweden found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on the emergence, survival,  growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings. However, one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass.
One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased the growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings.
