Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in Germany and India found that exploratory and foraging behaviours increased and stereotypic behaviours decreased in sloth bears and spectacled bears when presented with food inside objects.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that exploring/foraging behaviours decreased in a sloth bear when presented with food inside objects.
One replicated study in the USA found that grizzly bears spent a similar time manipulating food in a box and freely available food.
