Survival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a degraded coastal swamp in Brazil reported that planting tree seedlings into mounds had mixed effects on survival over three years, depending on the species.
Growth (1 study): The same study reported that tree seedlings planted into mounds typically grew at a similar rate, over three years, to seedlings planted at ground level. Growth was measured in terms of diameter, height and canopy area.
