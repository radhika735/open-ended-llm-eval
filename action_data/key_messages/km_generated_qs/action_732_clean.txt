One replicated study in Scotland found increased survival in salmon fed a probiotic before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over a 28 day period compared with controls.
A replicated, controlled study in Norway found the number of salmon infected with lice was reduced by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein. Adding beta-glucans to the diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared with controls.
The same study found the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing the development of soybean-induced enteritis compared with controls.
