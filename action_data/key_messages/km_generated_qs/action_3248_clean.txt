3248: Add surface mulch: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using organic mulch to restore or create brackish/salt marshes. The study was in Australia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study on a sandflat in Australia found that mulched and unmulched plots had similar plant species richness over two years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study on a sandflat in Australia found that mulched plots were more likely to contain glasswort Sarcocornia quinqueflora than unmulched plots, after 20 months. However, mulching had no significant effect on glasswort biomass after 20 months, and typically had no significant effect on glasswort cover over two years.
