2021: Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of red lighting on bat populations. Two studies were in the Netherlands and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that red lighting resulted in higher activity (relative abundance) for one of three bat species groups than white or green lighting. One site comparison study in the Netherlands found that culverts illuminated with red light had similar activity of commuting Daubenton’s bats as culverts illuminated with white or green light.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)         

Behaviour (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light, but no difference was found between red and blue lights.
