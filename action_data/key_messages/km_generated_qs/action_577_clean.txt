577: Translocate woodpeckers
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

All five translocation programmes studied were for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in the southern USA.
Six studies of four programmes found that &gt;50% of translocated birds remained in their new sites, with two studies of the same programme reporting a large population increase.
Birds from four programmes were reported as forming pairs or breeding, although some translocated pairs split up and some translocated nestlings were abandoned.
One study found that translocated nestlings fledged at similar rates to native chicks.
