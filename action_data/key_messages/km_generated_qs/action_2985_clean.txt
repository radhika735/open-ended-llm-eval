2985: Abandon mined land: allow brackish/saline marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning formerly mined land with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. The study was in France.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One replicated study in France simply classified the plant community types that developed on abandoned salt pans. Areas flooded for at least part of the year developed salt marsh plant communities, with the exact community composition depending on the duration of flooding and soil salinity.
