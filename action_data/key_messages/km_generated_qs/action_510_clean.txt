510: Foster eggs or chicks of raptors with wild conspecifics
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Ten out of 11 studies from across the world found that fostering raptor chicks to wild conspecifics had high success rates.
A single study from the USA found that only one of six eggs fostered to wild bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus nests were hatched and raised. The authors suggest that the other eggs may have been infertile.
A replicated study from Spain found that Spanish imperial eagle Aquila adalberti chicks were no more likely to survive to fledging if they were transferred to foster nests from three chick broods (at high risk from siblicide), compared to chicks left in three-chick broods.
A replicated study from Spain found that young (15–20 years old) Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus chicks were successfully adopted, but three older (27–29 day old) chicks were rejected.
