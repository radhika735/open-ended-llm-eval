285: Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Key Messages:

A total of eight studies and two literature reviews from coastal and pelagic fisheries across the world found strong evidence for reduced seabird bycatch on longlines when streamer lines were used.  
A replicated, controlled trial from the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean found no reduction in bycatch rates when using streamer lines, whilst five studies were inconclusive, uncontrolled or had weak evidence for reductions. 
The effect of streamer lines appears to vary between seabird species: northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis were consistently caught at lower rates when streamers were used but shearwaters Puffinus spp. and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were caught at similar rates with and without streamers in one study each.
The three studies that investigated the use of multiple streamer lines all found that fewer birds were caught when two streamer lines were used, compared to one, with even fewer caught when three were used.
