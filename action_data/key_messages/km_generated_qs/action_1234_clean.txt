1234: Thin trees after wildfire 
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Five replicated, controlled studies examined the effects of thinning trees in burnt forest areas. Two studies in Spain found that thinning increased plant species richness. One in Canada found that it increased the cover of aspen saplings. One study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one in Israel found it decreased mortality of pine seedlings.
One paired-site study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses.
