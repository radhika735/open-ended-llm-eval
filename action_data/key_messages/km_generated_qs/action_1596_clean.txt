1596: Captive breeding and reintroduction of primates into the wild: born and raised in a free-ranging environment
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Brazil found that only two out of three reintroduced black lion tamarins survived over four months, despite being raised in a free-ranging environment, alongside other interventions.
One controlled study in Madagascar found that the diet of reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs that were born and raised in a free-ranging environment alongside other interventions, overlapped with that of wild lemurs.
