3415: Remove topsoil or turf before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

Six studies examined the effects of removing topsoil or turf before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Three studies were in the UK, two studies were in the USA and one was in France.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (3 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of intact steppe.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness.
Sown/planted species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased the species richness of sown plants.
Grass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased grass species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing.
Forb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (2 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds did not alter overall vegetation cover.
Sown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before planting seedlings led to higher cover of planted species.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before planting seedlings led to lower cover of common knapweed.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one paired and one randomized) in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants.
