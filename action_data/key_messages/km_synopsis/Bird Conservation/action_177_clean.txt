177: Manage hedges to benefit birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

The one study of six that investigated species richness found no difference in species richness between a UK site with wildlife-friendly hedge management and three control sites.
Seven studies from the UK and Switzerland, five replicated, found that some species studied increased in relation to managed hedges or were more likely to be found in managed hedges, compared to other habitats. Two investigated several interventions at once. 
One replicated study found that species that showed positive responses to hedge management in some regions showed weak or negative responses in other parts of the UK. Four studies from the UK found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management of hedges.
