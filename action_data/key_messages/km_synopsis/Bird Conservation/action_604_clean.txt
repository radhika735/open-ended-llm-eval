604: Artificially incubate and hand-rear seabirds in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Five studies from across the world found evidence for the success of hand-rearing seabirds.
One small study in Spain found that one of five hand-reared Audouin’s gulls Larus audouinii successfully bred in the wild.
Four studies found that various petrel species (Procellariiformes) successfully fledged after hand-rearing. One controlled study found that fledging rates of hand-reared birds was similar to parent-reared birds, although a study on a single bird found that the chick fledged at a lower weight and later than parent-reared chicks.
