1045: American bullfrog control: Direct removal of adults
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

One replicated study in Belgium found catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 h to be very low. 
One small study in the USA found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface. 
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of the adults.
One before-and-after study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment.
