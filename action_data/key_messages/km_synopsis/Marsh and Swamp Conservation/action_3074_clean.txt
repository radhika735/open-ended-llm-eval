3074: Change season/timing of prescribed burning: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of burning freshwater marshes in different seasons or at different times. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater plant species richness than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater overall vegetation cover than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the cover and frequency of some individual plant species responded differently to spring vs summer burning.
