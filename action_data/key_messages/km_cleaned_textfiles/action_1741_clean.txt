Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of restoring water flow across service corridors. The study was in a fen.
Characteristic plants (1 study): One before-and-after study in a fen in the USA found that following restoration of water inflow across a road (along with general rewetting), cover of wet peatland sedges increased whilst cover of grasses preferring drier conditions decreased.
