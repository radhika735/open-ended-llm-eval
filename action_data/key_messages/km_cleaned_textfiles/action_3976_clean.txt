3976: Plant new hedges 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of planting new hedges on butterflies and moths. Five studies were in the UK and one was in each of Ireland and Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (5 studies): Three of four site comparison studies (including three replicated and three paired studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture. The other study found that hedgerows had a similar species richness of butterflies to grass banks between fields. One replicated study in the UK found that gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows had more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than more commonly planted hawthorn.

POPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, three paired, site comparison studies and two site comparison studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5â€“10 metres away from hedgerows.The other study found that the abundance of butterflies along hedgerows was similar to grass banks between fields without hedgerows.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the UK found that moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to be flying parallel to it than moths recorded further away.
