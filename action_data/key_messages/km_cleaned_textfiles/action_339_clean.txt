Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Key Messages:

Of four studies captured, one, a before-and-after study from the UK, found that local wader populations increased following the annual cutting semi-natural grasslands. 
A replicated, controlled study from the UK found that ducks grazed at higher densities on cut areas, a second replicated study from the UK found that goose grazing densities were unaffected by cutting frequency.
A replicated study from the USA found that Henslow's sparrows were more likely to be recaptured on unmown, compared with mown grasslands.
