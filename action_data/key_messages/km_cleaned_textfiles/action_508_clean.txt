508: Foster eggs or chicks of waders with wild conspecifics
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two small trials in North America found that piping plovers Charadrius melodus accepted chicks introduced into their broods, although in one case the chick died later the same day.
A replicated study from New Zealand found that survival of fostered black stilts Himantopus novasezelandiae was higher for birds fostered to conspecifics rather than a closely related species.
