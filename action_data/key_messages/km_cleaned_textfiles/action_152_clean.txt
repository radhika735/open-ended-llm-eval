152: Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

A long-term replicated controlled trial in Switzerland found that annual spring burning of calcareous grassland did not increase plant species richness relative to abandoned plots, after 15 years.


A replicated controlled trial in Northern Ireland found that heather moorland subject to a single burn had more plant species eight years after the management, than control unburned plots.
