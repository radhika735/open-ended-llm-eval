3425: Add mulch before or after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

Six studies examined the effects of adding mulch before or after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in Canada, two were in the USA, and one study was in each of the UK and Germany.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not alter the species richness of target plants.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not increase plant cover.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species.
Sown/planted species abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA and UK found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not alter the density of six sown plant species in most cases. The other study found that adding mulch before planting seedlings reduced the cover of planted species.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that adding mulch before planting seedlings did not alter the cover of common knapweed.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (2 STUDIES) 

Germination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings in most cases.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that adding mulch after planting native prairie plants did not alter the growth of any of seven plant species.
