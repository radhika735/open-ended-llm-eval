827: Remove or control fish by catching
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Four studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA found that removing fish by catching them significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs or increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog. One before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Sweden found that fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced.
