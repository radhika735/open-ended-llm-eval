467: Turn off lights to reduce mortality from artificial lights
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
A before-and-after study from the UK found that fewer seabirds (Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus, European storm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus and Leach’s storm petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa) were attracted to artificial lighting and downed when lighting was reduced at night, compared to when normal lighting was in place.
