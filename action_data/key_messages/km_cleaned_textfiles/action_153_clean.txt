153: Create scrapes and pools
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Three studies from Sweden and the UK (including two site comparisons one of which was replicated) found that the creation of scrapes and pools provided habitat for a range of plant, invertebrate or bird species and resulted in increased aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity. One of these studies found constructed pools supported locally or nationally scarce species of plant and water beetle.


A study in Sweden found that a combination of      large surface area, high shoreline complexity and shallow depth resulted      in increased bird, bottom-dwelling invertebrate and aquatic plant      diversity. However there were fewer fish species than in natural wetlands. Two replicated      studies from Ireland and the UK (one controlled paired study and a site      comparison) found that bird visit rates were higher but invertebrate      numbers varied in ditch-fed paired ponds compared with dry controls and total macroinvertebrate and beetle richness did not      differ between artificial and natural ponds, although communities did      differ.
