1777: Introduce an organism to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing an organism (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants. The study was in a fen meadow.
Plant community composition (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen meadow in Belgium found that introducing a parasitic plant altered the overall plant community composition.
Vegetation cover (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant reduced cover of the dominant sedge but increased moss cover.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant increased overall plant species richness.
