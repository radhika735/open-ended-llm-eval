3313: Add surface mulch before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Canada.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch after planting wetland herbs typically had no significant effect on total live vegetation biomass, two growing seasons later.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that adding surface mulch increased the cover of one of two planted herb species (creeping alkaligrass Puccinellia phryganodes) but had no significant effect on cover of the other species (estuary sedge Carex subspathacea). Cover was monitored over the second growing season after planting/mulching.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch had no significant effect on the survival of two of two planted herb species, after two growing seasons.
