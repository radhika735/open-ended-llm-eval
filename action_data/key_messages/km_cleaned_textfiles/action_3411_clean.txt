3411: Use slot/strip seeding
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of using slot/strip seeding on grassland vegetation. Both studies were in the UK.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Grass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased grass species richness.
Forb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased forb species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)

Sown/planted species abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.
