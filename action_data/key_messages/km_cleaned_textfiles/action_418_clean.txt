418: Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by avian predators
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Five studies from the USA and Europe found reductions in consumption of eggs treated with various chemicals. A further ex situ study from the USA found that American kestrels Falco sparverius consumed fewer chicks when they were treated, but not to the point of losing body condition.
Three studies from the USA found some evidence that treating eggs with some chemicals may have reduced predation of eggs after treatment stopped, or  of untreated eggs, although two of these were only short term experiments and the third found that the effect was lost after a year. 
Four studies from the Europe and the USA found no evidence for conditioning, or a reduction in predation of wild (untreated) eggs.
