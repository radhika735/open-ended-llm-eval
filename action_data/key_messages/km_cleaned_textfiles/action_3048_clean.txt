3048: Cut large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance: freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study of freshwater swamps in the USA found that cutting woody vegetation (and applying herbicide) had no significant effect on herbaceous ground cover one year later: there were similar changes in treated and untreated swamps.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Basal area (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study of freshwater swamps in the USA found that cutting woody vegetation (and applying herbicide) had no significant effect on the basal area of woody vegetation one year later: there were similar changes in treated and untreated swamps.
Canopy cover (1 study): The same study found that cutting woody vegetation (and applying herbicide) reduced canopy cover – to similar levels as in high-quality swamps after one year.
