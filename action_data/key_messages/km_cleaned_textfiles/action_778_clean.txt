778: Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Key Messages:

Three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in the USA found that understory removal using herbicide had no effect or some negative effects on amphibian abundance.
One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that following logging American toad abundance was similar and wood frogs lower in stands with herbicide treatment and planting compared to stands left to regenerate naturally.
