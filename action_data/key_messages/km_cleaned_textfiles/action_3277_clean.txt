3277: Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange in brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were in the same estuarine site in the USA.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted California cordgrass Spartina foliosa reached a similar height, after three growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.
Individual plant size (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted salt marsh herbs reached a similar overall size, after 1–2 growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.

OTHER

Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted salt marsh herbs typically had similar survival rates, after 1–2 growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.
