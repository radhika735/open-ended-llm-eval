3306: Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that adding fertilizer had no significant effect, after two years, on the height of tree saplings planted into floating peat bags.
Diameter, perimeter, area (1 study): The same study found that adding fertilizer had no significant effect, after two years, on the diameter of two of three tree species planted into floating peat bags. However, fertilized pond apple Annona glabra saplings had thicker stems than unfertilized saplings.

OTHER

Growth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that adding fertilizer increased the growth rate of baldcypress Taxodium distichum seedlings planted into a marsh. This was true for both diameter and height growth.
