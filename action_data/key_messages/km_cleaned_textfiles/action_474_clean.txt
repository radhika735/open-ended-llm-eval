474: Replace nesting substrate following severe weather
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:
Two before-and-after studies from Canada found that common tern Sterna hirundo populations increased at one colony where nesting substrates were replaced, but decreased at a second. Several other interventions were used at both sites, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of substrate replacement.
