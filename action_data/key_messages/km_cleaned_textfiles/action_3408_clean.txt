3408: Sow seeds in part of site
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of sowing seeds in part of a site on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one was in the Czech Republic.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (2 STUDIES)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated study in the USA found that sowing seeds in part of a site resulted in an increase in plant species richness over time.
Sown/planted species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Czech Republic found that sowing seeds in part of a site did not alter species richness for sown grass and herb species.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (2 STUDY)

Sown/planted species abundance (2 studies): One study in the USA found that after sowing seeds in part of a site, new patches of two of three sown plant species were recorded in unsown areas. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Czech Republic found that sowing seeds in part of a site did not alter the cover of sown grass and herb species.
