2302: (CFT) Wetland plants: Allow resting time between grazing periods (29b)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Plants (2 studies)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands in the USA found no difference in the relative cover of native plants in pool edges in wet season grazed versus continullay grazed plots. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from forested pastures in the USA found no difference in plant cover on stream banks between areas grazed at different times.
Diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled before-and-after study in wet grasslands in the USA found greater declines in native plant species richness in pool edges in wet season grazed versus continually grazed plots.
