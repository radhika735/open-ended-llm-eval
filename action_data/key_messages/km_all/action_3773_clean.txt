Two studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred tuatara into the wild. One study was in New Zealand and one was a global review.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, 32% of reptile translocations/releases (releases of captive individuals were 7% of total projects) were successful.
Condition (1 study): One study in New Zealand found that tuatara reared close to the release site had higher growth, but similar body condition compared to individuals reared in a warmer climate.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 studies): One study in New Zealand found that tuatara reared close to the release site had similar home range sizes and post-release dispersal compared to individuals reared in a warmer climate.
