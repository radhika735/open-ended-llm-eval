2304: (CFT) Soil fauna: Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops (16b, 16c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Soil organisms (5 studies)

Microbial biomass (4 studies): Four replicated studies (three randomized and controlled, one site comparison) from France and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with ground cover, compared to bare or tilled soils, in some or all comparisons.
Fungi (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study from the USA found more symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae) in soils with seeded cover crops, compared to tilled soils, in some comparisons, but found similar numbers of roots that were colonized by mycorrhizae. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found inconsistent differences in mycorrhizae in soils with seeded cover crops or tilled soils.
Bacteria (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found more bacteria, but similar levels of bacterial diversity, in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils.
Nematodes (1 study): One replicated site comparison from France found more nematodes in soils with ground cover, compared to bare soils.
