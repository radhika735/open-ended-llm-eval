610: Artificially incubate and hand-rear bustards in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

A review of a houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii captive breeding programme in Saudi Arabia found that there was no difference in survival between artificially and parentally incubated eggs. 
A second review of the same programme found that removing eggs from clutches as they were laid increased the number laid by females.
