3324: Introduce nurse plants to aid focal non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing nurse plants to freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were on the same site in the USA, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that sowing potential nurse plants alongside target sedge meadow species reduced the density of the target species overall, and of target grass-like species. Nurse plant addition sometimes affected the abundance of target forbs, depending on the presence of an invasive species and addition of sawdust to plots.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in wet basins in the USA quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. One study reported that sowing potential nurse plants typically had no significant effect on – and sometimes reduced – the biomass of sown porcupine sedge Carex hystericina, after 1–2 growing seasons. The other study reported varying effects of potential nurse plants on the abundance of individual target plant species, depending on factors such as diversity of the nurse crop and addition of sawdust to plots.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE
 
OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that the presence of a high-diversity nurse crop reduced the germination rate of sown sedge meadow species. A low-diversity nurse crop had no significant effect on their germination rate.
