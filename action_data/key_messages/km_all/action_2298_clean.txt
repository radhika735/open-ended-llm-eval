2298: (CFT) Scrubland plants: Add sewage sludge to the soil (18c)
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:
Plants (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies from Spain found greater plant cover and faster tree growth in plots with added sewage sludge, compared to plots without it, in some or all comparisons. One of these studies found similar numbers of plant species in plots with or without added sewage sludge. The other one found more plant biomass in plots with added sewage sludge.
