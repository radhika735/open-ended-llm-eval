188: Protect bird nests using electric fencing
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

One before-and-after study from the UK found an increase in tern numbers after the erection of an electric fence, whilst a study from the USA found an increase in the number of nests.
Five studies from the USA found higher survival or productivity at wader or seabird colonies with electric fencing, compared to areas without fencing, although one study found that hatching rates were no different, whilst nesting success was only higher in one of two years.
One study from the USA found lower predation by mammalian predators inside electric fence exclosures, whilst predation by birds was higher.
