3917: Maintain traditional orchards to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of maintaining traditional orchards on butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar community composition of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards.
Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards. One controlled study in the USA found that an unmanaged and a partially managed orchard had a greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than a commercially managed orchard.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards.
