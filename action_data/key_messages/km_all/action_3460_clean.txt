3460: Create long flexible habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. The study was in a port in the Netherlands.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. The flexible habitats themselves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats.
