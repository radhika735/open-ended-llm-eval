772: Create refuges
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Indonesia found that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance, but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species. One before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations.
Two studies (including one replicated study) in New Zealand and the USA found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding.
