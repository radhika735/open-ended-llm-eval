3301: Add lime or similar chemicals before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Two studies were in Canada. One study was in the USA. One study was in a greenhouse.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada reported that liming reduced the above-ground biomass of planted salt marsh vegetation after one year.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): One controlled study in former borrow pits in the USA found that limed and unlimed plots supported similar biomass of a planted herb species after 1–2 growing seasons. In contrast, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in salt-contaminated peat in Canada found that limed pots supported lower biomass of two sown herb species than unlimed pots, after four months.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE
 
OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in salt-contaminated peat in Canada found that for each of two sown herb species, germination rates were similar in limed and unlimed pots.
