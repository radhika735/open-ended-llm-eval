  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated study from Australia and two small studies from the USA found that three species of songbird were successfully bred in captivity.\nFour out of five pairs of wild-bred, hand-reared puaiohi, Myadestes palmeri, formed pairs and laid a total of 39 eggs in 1998 and a breeding population of helmeted honeyeaters, Lichenostomus melanops cassidix, was successfully established through a breeding programme.\nOnly one pair of loggerhead shrikes, Lanius ludovicianus, formed pairs from eight wild birds caught and their first clutch died."
