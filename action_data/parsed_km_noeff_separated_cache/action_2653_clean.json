  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of gathering coarse woody debris into piles after felling. Both studies were in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in Canada found higher mammal species richness where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in Canada found higher counts of San Bernardino long-tailed voles where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles. The other study found higher small mammal abundance at one of three plots where debris was gathered into piles.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
