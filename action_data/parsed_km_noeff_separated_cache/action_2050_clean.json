One study was in Brazil and one in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Brazil found that a reforested area had significantly lower bat diversity than a native forest fragment.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in Australia found that forests restored after mining had significantly higher or similar bat activity (relative abundance) as unmined forests for five of seven bat species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
