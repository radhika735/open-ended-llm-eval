  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies from across the world found evidence for the success of hand-rearing seabirds.\nOne small study in Spain found that one of five hand-reared Audouinâ€™s gulls Larus audouinii successfully bred in the wild.\nFour studies found that various petrel species (Procellariiformes) successfully fledged after hand-rearing. One controlled study found that fledging rates of hand-reared birds was similar to parent-reared birds, although a study on a single bird found that the chick fledged at a lower weight and later than parent-reared chicks."
