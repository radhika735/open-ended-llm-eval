  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding cover other than mulch to freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs increased their overall cover, one year later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs reduced the cover of two problematic herb species, one year later.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
