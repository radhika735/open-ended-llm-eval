One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USAÂ found no difference in nitrogen between areas with low or high levels of simulated grazing.\nSoil organisms (0 studies)\nSoil erosion and aggregation (0 studies)\nGreenhouse gases (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USA found no differences in rates of soil respiration between areas with low or high levels of simulated grazing."
