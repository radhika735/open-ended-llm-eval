  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting mining on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in the Bering Sea (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate community composition became similar to that of an unmined site.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One  site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate richness and diversity became similar to that of an unmined site.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate abundance and biomass became similar to that of an unmined site."
