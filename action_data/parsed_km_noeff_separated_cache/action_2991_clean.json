  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of plugging/damming canals or trenches in freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of backfilled canals in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that emergent marsh vegetation coverage was greater within the channels of plugged than unplugged canals, after 6–60 months. However, coverage on former spoil areas did not significantly differ between plugged and unplugged canals.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
