  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects of removing or controlling predators using lethal controls on snake and lizard populations. Four studies were in New Zealand, two were in each of Australia and the Gal치pagos, and one was in each of Indonesia, Antigua, Mexico and the Bahamas.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (8 studies): Four of six before-and-after studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in New Zealand, Antigua, Mexico and the Bahamas found that on islands where both Pacific rats and European rabbits, Pacific rats, black rats and cats were eradicated, the abundance of lizards and Antiguan racer snakes. One study found that on an island where black rats were eradicated the number of San Salvador rock iguanas remained similar compared to before eradication. The other study found that eradicating mice had mixed effects on the abundance of lizards. One study also found that lizard abundance on an island with eradication was initially lower than on a predator free island, but after two years was similar or higher. One controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that across areas with fox and cat control or only fox control, gecko and skink numbers were similar to an area with no control, but dragon lizard numbers were lower. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that in areas with fox control sand goanna abundance was higher and there was mixed effects on small lizard abundance compared to in areas with no control.\nReproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Gal치pagos found that on an island where cats were eradicated the number of offspring of reintroduced Gal치pagos land iguanas was higher than before cat control began.\nSurvival: (2 studies): One study in New Zealand found that survival of captive-bred Otago skinks released into an enclosure after mouse eradication was higher compared to when skinks were released in the presence of mice. One study in Indonesia reported no mortality of monitor lizards following use of poison baits to control black rats.\nCondition (2 studies): One of two studies in Indonesia and the Gal치pagos found that on an island where black rats were controlled, rodenticide was detected in the livers of lava lizards for up to 850 days after its use began. The other study reported no illness in monitor lizards following use of poison baits to control black rats.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
