Both studies were in Switzerland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Switzerland found that farms and landscapes with a greater number of habitats or crop types had a similar species richness of butterflies to farms and landscapes with fewer different habitats or crop types.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a greater number of habitats had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with fewer different habitats.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
