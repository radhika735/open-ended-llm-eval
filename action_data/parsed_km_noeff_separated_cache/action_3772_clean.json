  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred crocodilians into the wild. Two studies were in China, one was in South Africa and one was a global review.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, 32% of reptile translocations/releases (releases of captive individuals were 7% of total projects) were successful. One study in South Africa reported that following releases of captive-bred Nile crocodiles, wild populations increased in size over 30 years, but then declined in the subsequent 15 years.\nReproduction (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated) in China reported that breeding or nesting was observed within four years of releasing captive-bred Chinese alligators.\nSurvival (1 study): One study in China reported that of nine captive-bred Chinese alligators, three survived for nine years and six survived for at least one year following release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in China reported that after 10 years of releases of captive bred Chinese alligators to an area that had historically been occupied, 56% of constructed ponds were occupied."
