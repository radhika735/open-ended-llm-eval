  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of irrigation (without planting) on peatland vegetation. One study was in a bog and one was in a fen.\nVegetation cover (2 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada found that irrigation increased the number of Sphagnum moss shoots present after one growing season, but had no effect after two. One before-and-after study in Germany reported that an irrigated fen was colonized by wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs, whilst cover of dryland grasses decreased."
