  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies      (including one replicated site comparison) from the Netherlands and the UK reported that the provision of riparian buffer strips had a positive      influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, and supported vegetation associated with habitats preferred      by water voles.\n\n\nTwo replicated site      comparison studies from France and Ireland found that the provision of      riparian buffer strips on farms did not result in an increase in the number of      plant species when compared to farms without buffer strips.\n\n\nOne replicated site      comparison study found ground beetle diversity was higher in grazed      riparian zones and narrow fenced strips than in wide riparian buffer      strips. However the ground beetle assemblages in      wide riparian buffer strips were more distinct from the adjacent pasture      field assemblages than either the grazed riparian zones or narrow fenced      strips."
