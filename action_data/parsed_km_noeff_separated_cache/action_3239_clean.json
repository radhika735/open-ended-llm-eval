  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to restore or create freshwater marshes. The study was in Germany.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany reported that the effect of annual fertilization (for 20 years) on the average moisture preference of the vegetation varied between sites.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of annual fertilization (for 20 years) on total plant species richness varied between sites.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in wet grasslands in Germany reported that plots fertilized every spring contained more vegetation biomass, after 4–18 years, than unfertilized plots.\nHerb abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the effect of annual fertilization (for 20 years) on cover of herb groups (sedges, rushes, forbs, ferns, grasses and legumes) varied between sites.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany reported that the effect of annual fertilization (for 20 years) on vegetation height varied between sites."
