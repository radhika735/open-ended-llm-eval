  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of planting trees on farmland to benefit reptiles. Both studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, paired sites study in Australia found that pastures with tree plantings had similar rare reptile species richness compared to pastures with no trees, but that more rare species were present with 50% canopy cover compared to 5% cover. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that farms with restoration planting (of native ground cover and trees) had lower reptile species richness than farms with remnant vegetation (of old growth woodland or natural regrowth).\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in Australia found that pastures with tree plantings had higher abundance of rare reptiles than pastures with no trees, and that rare reptiles were more abundant with 50% canopy cover compared to 5% cover.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
