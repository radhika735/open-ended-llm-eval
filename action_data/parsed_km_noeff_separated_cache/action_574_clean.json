  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies of three translocation programmes in the UK and the USA found that all three successfully established populations of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, red kites Milvus milvus and ospreys Pandion halieatus. However, the latest review of the programme to reintroduce red kites to England and Scotland reported that one of six populations was very small, with only four pairs, despite 90 birds being released.\nA replicated study in Spain found high survival and establishment of translocated Montagu’s harrier Circus pygargus fledglings."
