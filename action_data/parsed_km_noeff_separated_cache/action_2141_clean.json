The study was in the North Atlantic Ocean (Portugal).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that using larger mesh sizes in the inner and/or outer panels of trammel nets did not affect the community composition of unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates (discard).\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that using larger mesh sizes in the inner and/or outer panels of trammel nets did not reduce the abundance of unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates (discard)."
