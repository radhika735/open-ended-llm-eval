  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of leaving standing/deadwood snags in forests on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding snags and woody debris had mixed effects on reptile diversity and species richness when compared to not manipulating debris or removing debris. The other study found that increasing standing coarse woody debris had no effect on reptile diversity and species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding snags and woody debris had mixed effects on reptile abundance when compared to not manipulating debris or removing debris. The other study found that increasing standing coarse woody debris had no effect on reptile abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
