  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of grazing brackish/salt marshes in different seasons or at different times. One study was in the USA and one was in the Netherlands. In both studies, the focal livestock were cattle.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots grazed annually by 0.5 cattle/ha and plots grazed biennially by 1.0 cattle/ha experienced a similar turnover of plant species over six years, and had a similar overall plant community composition after six years.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that plots grazed annually by 0.5 cattle/ha and plots grazed biennially by 1.0 cattle/ha experienced similar increases in plant species richness over six years, and had similar species richness after six years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that summer- and autumn-grazed plots experienced similar changes in live vegetation biomass, over one year.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that grazing annually with 0.5 cattle/ha stimulated greater increases in cover of sea aster Aster tripolium than grazing biennially with 1.0 cattle/ha. There was no significant difference between the grazing regimes for cover of sea couch grass Elytrigia atheria. Vegetation was monitored over six years.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
