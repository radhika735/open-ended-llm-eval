  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of shelterwood harvesting on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting had mixed effects on reptile species richness compared to areas with no management.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized study in the USA found that areas with shelterwood harvesting had a lower abundance of juvenile eastern box turtles than clearcut areas. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that shelterwood harvesting had mixed effects on reptile abundance compared to areas with no management.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
