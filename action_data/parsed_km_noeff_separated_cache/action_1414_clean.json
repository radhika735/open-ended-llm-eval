  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nAmphibians (0 studies)\nBirds (0 studies)\nInvertebrates (0 studies)\nMammals (0 studies)\nPlants (2 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study from Italy found similar numbers of plant species in planted flower strips and unplanted field margins, but found higher plant diversity in unplanted margins. One replicated study from the USA found that most flower species persisted for at least two years after planting.\nReptiles (0 studies)\nImplementation options (2 studies): One replicated study from the USA found that more plant species persisted in flower strips when twice as many seeds were sown, but there was no further increase in persistence at higher seeding rates. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain found that tillage had inconsistent effects on the emergence of planted flowers."
