  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies examined the effects of grazing with livestock after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Five studies were in Europe, one study was in New Zealand and one was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (5 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Italy found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing. One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing.\nSown/planted species richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated study in the UK found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in New Zealand found that grazing with sheep continuously after sowing seeds did not alter sown species richness compared to grazing on rotation.\nNative/non-target species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased native plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Hungary found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds did not alter the cover of target plant species compared to sowing without grazing.\nSown/planted species abundance (2 studies): One replicated study in the UK found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds reduced the cover of sown species compared to grazing with sheep. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in New Zealand found that grazing with sheep continuously after sowing seeds increased the cover of four of eight sown species compared to grazing on rotation.\nNative/non-target species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds reduced the cover of native plant species compared to sowing without grazing.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grazing in the winter after sowing seeds resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings."
