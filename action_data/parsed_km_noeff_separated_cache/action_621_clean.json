  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies of five release programmes from the USA and Russia, from a total of eight programmes, found that released cranes had high survival or bred in the wild. Two studies from two release programmes in the USA found low survival of captive-bred eggs fostered to wild birds, compared with wild eggs, or a failure to increase the wild flock size.\nA worldwide review found that releases of migratory species only tended to be successful if birds were released into existing flocks, with higher success for non-migratory populations.\nOne study from the USA found that birds released as sub-adults had higher survival than birds cross-fostered to wild birds.\nOne study from the USA found that 73% of all mortalities occurred in the first year after release."
