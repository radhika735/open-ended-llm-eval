  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping to restore or create brackish/saline swamps. Three studies were in the USA. Two of these shared a study site. There was one study in Singapore and one in Thailand.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One study of a coastal site in the USA reported that the area of mangrove vegetation increased between 6 and 14 years after reprofiling (and planting propagules).\nRelative abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the USA and Singapore reported that areas of reprofiled coastal land (sometimes also planted with propagules) supported a different relative abundance of tree species to natural forests, after roughly 3–15 years.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Singapore reported that an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation had higher plant species richness, after three and a half years, than an adjacent mature mangrove patch.\nTree/shrub richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they contained a similar number of tree species to nearby mature forests after 7–30 years. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand simply reported the number of mangrove tree species that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Singapore reported that an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation had a higher density of individual plants, after three and a half years, than an adjacent mature mangrove patch.\nTree/shrub abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they contained a greater density of trees than nearby mature forests after 17–30 years. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand simply reported the number of mangrove trees that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove trees, by species, that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nOverall structure (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they had a different overall structure to nearby mature forests after 17–30 years.\nHeight (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they had a shorter canopy than nearby mature forests after 17–30 years. One site comparison study in Singapore reported that in an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation, most plants were in a similar height category to those in an adjacent mature mangrove patch, but that the maximum plant height was lower. Vegetation was surveyed three and a half years after reprofiling.\nDiameter/perimeter/area (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the USA reported that mangrove forests that developed on reprofiled (and planted) coastal areas contained thinner trees, on average, than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years.\nBasal area (3 studies): Three site comparison studies in the USA compared mangrove forests that developed on reprofiled (and planted) coastal areas to mature natural forests. Two of the studies reported that restored forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years. The other study reported that restored forests had a similar basal area to mature natural forests, after 17–30 years."
