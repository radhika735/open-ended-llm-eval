  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing or retaining set-aside areas on farmland. Three studies were in the UK and one was in Switzerland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including two site comparison studies), in the UK and Switzerland, found that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland, or brown hare numbers relative to numbers on farms without set-aside areas.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A before-and-after study in the UK found that use of uncut set-aside areas by wood mice increased after crop harvesting."
