  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies examined the effects of sowing seeds of parasitic species on grassland vegetation. Four studies were in the UK, one study was in Switzerland and one was in Belgium.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (6 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (6 studies): Five of six studies (including five controlled studies and one review) in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plants yellow rattle, European yellow rattle or marsh lousewort increased plant species richness and/or diversity. The other study found that sowing yellow rattle seeds did not alter plant species richness.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant yellow rattle led to a decrease in total plant biomass in three of four studies.\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One controlled study in Belgium found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant marsh lousewort increased the abundance of six target plant species.\nGrass abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant European yellow rattle led to a decrease in grass cover.\nForb abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant European yellow rattle did not alter the cover of forbs.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)"
