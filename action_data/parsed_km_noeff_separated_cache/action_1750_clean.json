  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of physically excluding vehicles from peatlands. The study was in a fen.\nVegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, site comparison study in a floating fen in the USA reported that fencing off airboat trails allowed total and non-woody vegetation biomass to increase, recovering to levels recorded in undisturbed fen. Woody plant biomass did not recover.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that fencing off airboat trails allowed overall plant diversity to increase, recovering to levels recorded in undisturbed fen."
