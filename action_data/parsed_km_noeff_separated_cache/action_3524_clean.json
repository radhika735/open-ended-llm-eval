Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Dominica and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (5 studies): One of two before-and-after studies (one replicated and controlled) in the USA found that installing road signs reduced road mortalities of massasaugas in autumn but not summer. The other study found that installing road signs did not reduce road mortalities of painted or Blanding’s turtles. Two before-and-after studies (one replicated) in Canada and the USA found that a combination of installing road signs with either fencing and tunnels or a hybrid nestbox-fencing barrier resulted in fewer road mortalities of massasaugas and diamondback terrapins. One before-and-after study in Dominica found that a combination of using road signs and running an awareness campaign resulted in fewer road mortalities of Antillean iguanas.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
