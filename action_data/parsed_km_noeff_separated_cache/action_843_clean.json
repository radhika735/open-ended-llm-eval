  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that there was no significant difference in abundance in clearcuts with woody debris retained or removed for eight of nine amphibian species, but that the overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians was more negative where woody debris was retained.\nTwo replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that the removal of coarse woody debris from standing forest did not decrease amphibian diversityÂ or overall amphibian abundance, but did reduce species richness in one study.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed.\nOne replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas, and was similar in wood piles to unharvested forest."
