  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals at a specific time (season or day/night). Three studies were in the USA and one each was in the UK, Canada, Ireland and Hungary.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (7 studies): Four of five studies in the UK, Canada and the USA found that translocated common dormice, black bears and Canadian lynx and captive-bred swift foxes released in a specific season had higher survival rates than those released during another season. The other study found that red squirrels translocated in autumn and winter had similar survival rates. A randomised, replicated, controlled study in Hungary found that translocated European ground squirrels released during the morning had higher recapture rates than those released during the afternoon. A study in the USA found that most translocated kangaroo rats released at dusk in artificial burrows supplied with food died within five days of release.\nCondition (1 study): A study in the UK found that common dormice translocated during summer lost less weight than those translocated during spring.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): Two studies in the UK and USA found that common dormice translocated during spring and black bears translocated during winter travelled shorter distances or settled closer to the release site than those translocated during summer."
