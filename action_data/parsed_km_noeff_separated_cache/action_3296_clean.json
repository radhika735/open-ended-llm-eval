  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding upland topsoil to freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Canada. One study was in a greenhouse.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater trenches in Canada found that adding a mixture of mineral soil and peat to pots of mine tailings before planting water sedge Carex aquatilis typically increased its above-ground biomass two growing seasons later.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nIndividual plant size (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that mixing topsoil into pots of mineral soil/compost before planting tussock sedge Carex stricta seedlings typically increased the biomass and number of shoots they developed over three months. However, one replicated, paired, controlled study in a wet meadow restoration site in the USA reported that mixing topsoil into the mineral soil/compost substrate before planting tussock sedge seedlings had no clear effect on the number of shoots they developed over two months.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater trenches in Canada found that adding a mixture of mineral soil and peat to pots of mine tailings either increased or had no significant effect on survival of planted water sedge Carex aquatilis over two growing seasons."
