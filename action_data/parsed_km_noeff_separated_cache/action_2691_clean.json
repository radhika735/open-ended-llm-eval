  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies examined the effects of releasing protected or species of concern alive after capture on marine fish populations. Two studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (USA and Canada), and one was in each of the Coral Sea (Australia), Tasman Sea (New Zealand), Cantabrian Sea (Spain) and the Pacific Ocean (USA). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (6 studies): Four of six replicated studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Tasman Sea, Cantabrian Sea and the Pacific Ocean found that the majority (76–92%) of unwanted (discarded or protected) small-spotted catshark, thorny skate, pearl perch and Atlantic wolffish, but less than half of smooth skate, survived for at least 1 h–5 days after capture and/or release, and survival was reduced by hooking/capture depth injuries and longer tow durations. One study found that nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived for four days after capture and release, but canary rockfish survival decreased with increasing capture depth. The other study found that all spinetail devilrays brailed aboard from purse seine nets survived but not those brought aboard entangled in the net.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
