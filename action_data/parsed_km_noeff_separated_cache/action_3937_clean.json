This study was in Panama.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Panama found that established plantations of native trees had a similar species richness of butterflies to plantations of exotic trees, but a greater species richness than old growth forest.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Panama found that established plantations of native trees had a similar abundance of butterflies to plantations of exotic trees, but a higher abundance than old growth forest.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
