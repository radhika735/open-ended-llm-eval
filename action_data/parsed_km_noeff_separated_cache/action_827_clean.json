  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USAÂ found that removing fish by catching them significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs or increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog. One before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in Sweden found that fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced."
