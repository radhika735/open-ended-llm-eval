  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of breeding marine and freshwater mammals in captivity. Three studies were in the USA, one study was also in China, Indonesia and Venezuela, and one study was in each of South Africa, Hong Kong and China.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One study in Hong Kong found that four of six female Indo-Pacific dolphins successfully conceived during a controlled captive breeding programme and gave birth to a total of nine calves. One study in China found that wild-caught Yangtze finless porpoises successfully reproduced in semi-captive conditions.\nSurvival (4 studies): Two studies in South Africa and the USA found that a captive-born common bottlenose dolphin, and a captive-born and hand-reared common bottlenose dolphin, survived in captivity for at least two and a half years and four years respectively. One review in the USA found that 80% of common bottlenose dolphins born in captivity over two decades survived, and survival increased with improved husbandry techniques. One review in the USA, China, Indonesia and Venezuela found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity.\nCondition (1 study): One study in China found that a population of Yangtze finless porpoises breeding in semi-captive conditions had low genetic diversity.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One study in the USA found that a captive-born and hand-reared common bottlenose dolphin displayed normal behaviour for the species and joined a dolphin social group in captivity."
