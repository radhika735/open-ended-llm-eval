  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in brackish/saline wetlands before planting trees/shrubs. The study was in Brazil.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a degraded coastal swamp in Brazil reported that planting tree seedlings into mounds had mixed effects on survival over three years, depending on the species.\nGrowth (1 study): The same study reported that tree seedlings planted into mounds typically grew at a similar rate, over three years, to seedlings planted at ground level. Growth was measured in terms of diameter, height and canopy area."
