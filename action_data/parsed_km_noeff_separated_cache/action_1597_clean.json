Two before-and-after studies in South Africa found that most reintroduced vervet monkeys survived over six months after being rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions.\nTwo before-and-after studies in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over 3.5–5 years after undergoing pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions. One study in The Gambia found that numbers of reintroduced chimpanzees that underwent pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions, increased by 38% over 25 years.\nOne review on bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas in 13 African countries found that rehabilitated bonobos living in sanctuaries did not reproduce but the reproductive rate of chimpanzees was 14% and of gorillas was 2%.\nOne controlled study in Indonesia found that Bornean agile gibbons that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, behaved similarly to wild gibbons.\nOne controlled study in Malaysia found that numbers of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years, despite orangutans being rehabilitated before release. One controlled study in Indonesia found that most translocated orangutans that were rehabilitated before release, along with other interventions, survived over three months.\nOne before-and-after, site comparison study in the Congo and Gabon found that most western lowland gorillas that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, survived over four years. One before-and-after study in Gabon found that one out of two western lowland gorillas that were reintroduced died despite being rehabilitated, alongside other interventions."
