  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating wetlands. Three studies were in the USA and one was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that the composition of mammal species present differed between a created and a natural wetland.\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the USA, found that mammal species richness did not differ between created and natural wetlands.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that following marshland restoration, muskrat abundance increased.\nSurvival (1 study): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK, found that water voles persisted better in wetlands that were partially restored using mechanical or manual methods than they did in wetlands undergoing complete mechanical restoration.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
