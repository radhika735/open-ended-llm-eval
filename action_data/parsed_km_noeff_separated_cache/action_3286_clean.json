  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in freshwater wetlands before planting emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were in the same wetland in the USA, but used different experimental set-ups.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that tussock sedge Carex stricta cover was typically similar across plots, after two growing seasons, whether sedges were planted into created mounds or hollows, or planted into flat ground.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nIndividual plant size (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that planting tussock sedges Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows had no significant effect on their individual biomass, after 1–2 growing seasons, when compared to planting into flat ground.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that planting tussock sedge Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows did not improve, and typically reduced, its survival rate compared to planting into flat ground. Survival was monitored after 1–2 growing seasons.\nGrowth (2 studies): The same studies found that planting tussock sedge Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows typically had no significant effect on its growth rate, over 1–2 growing seasons, compared to planting into flat ground."
