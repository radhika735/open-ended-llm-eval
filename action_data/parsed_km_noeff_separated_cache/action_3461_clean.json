  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of reducing the slope of intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. The studies were in an estuary in southeast Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia reported that reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure, along with creating rock pools, increased the combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on the structure.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAlgal abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure did not increase the macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces.\nInvertebrate abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that reducing the slope of an intertidal artificial structure did not increase the oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
