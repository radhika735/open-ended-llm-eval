  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of applying a non-fungal root dip before planting.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
