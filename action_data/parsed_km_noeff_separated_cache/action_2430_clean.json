  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals to reduce overpopulation. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that adult elk numbers approximately halved after the translocation of wolves to the reserve.\nReproductive success (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that elk calf:cow ratios approximately halved after the translocation of wolves to the reserve.\nSurvival (2 studies): A study in Australia found that koalas translocated to reduce overpopulation had lower survival than individuals in the source population. A study in the USA found that following translocation to reduce over-abundance, white-tailed deer had lower survival rates compared to non-translocated deer at the recipient site.\nOccupancy/range (1 study): A study in the USA found that following translocation to reduce over-abundance at the source site, white-tailed deer had similar home range sizes compared to non-translocated deer at the recipient site.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
