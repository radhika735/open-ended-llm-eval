  "action_title": "Abandon cropland: allow brackish/saline marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning cropland with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
