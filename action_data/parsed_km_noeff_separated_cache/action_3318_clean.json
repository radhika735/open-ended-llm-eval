  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding cover other than mulch to freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native shrubs had no significant effect on their overall cover, one year later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting swamp gum Eucalyptus camphora seedlings had no significant effect on swamp gum cover, one year later. Covering plots with mats also reduced cover of two problematic herb species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE                                         \n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that planted swamp gum Eucalyptus camphora seedlings reached a similar height, after one year, in covered and uncovered plots. Covers were plastic or jute mats."
