  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of creating uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields on reptile populations. One study was in Australia and one was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that revegetated linear strips had similar reptile species richness compared to cleared and remnant strips. The study also found that revegetated strips and patches had similar reptile species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that revegetated linear strips had similar reptile abundance compared to cleared and remnant strips. The study also found that revegetated strips and patches had similar reptile abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in the UK found that uncultivated field margins were used by slow worms, common lizards and grass snakes, but not by adders."
