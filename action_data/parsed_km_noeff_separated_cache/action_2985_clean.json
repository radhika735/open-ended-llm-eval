  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning formerly mined land with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. The study was in France.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity types (1 study): One replicated study in France simply classified the plant community types that developed on abandoned salt pans. Areas flooded for at least part of the year developed salt marsh plant communities, with the exact community composition depending on the duration of flooding and soil salinity.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
