One study was in Kenya and one was in Mozambique.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A before-and-after study in Kenya found that after a fence was built around a protected area, mammal species richness initially increased in both study sites, but subsequently declined at one of the sites.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): A paired sites study in Mozambique found that inside a fenced sanctuary there were more mammal scats than outside the sanctuary. A before-and-after study in Kenya found that after a fence was built around a protected area, mammal abundance initially increased in both study sites, but it subsequently declined at one of the sites.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
