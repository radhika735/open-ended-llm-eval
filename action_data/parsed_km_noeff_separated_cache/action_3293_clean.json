  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/saline wetlands before planting emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual plant abundance (1 study): One study quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that tilling sediment before planting California cordgrass Spartina foliosa had no significant effect on its biomass or density after two growing seasons, but did reduce its biomass after one growing season.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that tilling sediment before planting California cordgrass Spartina foliosa had no significant effect on its height after 1–2 growing seasons.\nIndividual plant size (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study on estuarine sediment in the USA found that the average size of planted salt marsh plants was similar, after 1–2 years, in tilled and untilled plots. Size was reported as an index incorporating plant height and lateral extent.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study on estuarine sediment in the USA found that survival rates of planted salt marsh plants were similar, over 1–2 years, in tilled and untilled plots."
