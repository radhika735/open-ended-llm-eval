  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing cutting frequency on grassland. One study was in each of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the UK, Germany and Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK, Germany and Italy found that meadows cut once/year had a higher species richness of butterflies (along with other pollinators) and moths than meadows cut two or more times/year. The other study found that meadows cut one, two or three times/year all had a similar species richness of butterflies.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including two randomized, paired, controlled studies and three site comparison studies) in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the UK and Italy and found that meadows cut once/year had a similar abundance of all butterflies, and of meadow brown adults and caterpillars and scarce large blue adults, to meadows cut two or three times/year. The other two studies found that meadows cut occasionally or once/year had a higher abundance of Scotch argus and pollinators (including butterflies) than intensively mown grasslands and meadows cut twice/year.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
