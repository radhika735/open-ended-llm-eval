  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf seven studies, one controlled study from the USA, found that overall bird diversity was similar between chained areas, burned areas and controls. A replicated and controlled study from the USA found that overall diversity was lower on mown sites than  controls, but that grassland-specialist species were present on managed sites.\nFive studies from the USA and Europe found than some study species were found at greater densities or abundances on sites with mechanical vegetation control than on sites with prescribed burning or  no management, or that abundances increased after management. One study investigated several interventions at once.\nOne study from the USA found that total bird densities were similar between chained, burned and control sites. A replicated controlled study from the USA found that mown sites had lower bird abundances than control sites. Three studies from the USA found that some species were less abundant on sites with mechanical vegetation removal, compared with burned or control sites, or showed smaller increases after management.\nOne replicated, controlled study from the USA found no differences between areas cut in winter and those cut in summer."
