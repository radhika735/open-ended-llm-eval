  "action_title": "Implement speed limits in particular areas (e.g. with high primate densities) to reduce vehicle collisions with primates",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of implementing speed limits in particular areas to reduce vehicle collisions with primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
