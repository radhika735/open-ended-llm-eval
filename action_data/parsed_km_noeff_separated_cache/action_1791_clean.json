  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of draining/replacing acidic surface water. Both studies were in fens.\nVegetation cover (2 studies): Two controlled studies in fens in the Netherlands reported that draining acidic water had mixed effects on cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs after 4–5 years, depending on the species and whether moss was also removed.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Netherlands reported that draining and replacing acidic water increased plant species richness."
