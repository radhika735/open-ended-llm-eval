  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting down problematic large trees/shrubs in brackish/salt marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a salt marsh in the USA reported that in seven of nine cases, the overall plant community composition varied more across plots from which mangrove trees had been removed than a plot from which mangrove trees had not been removed. Vegetation was surveyed after two years of continual tree removal.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a salt marsh in the USA reported that removing &gt;50% of invading mangrove trees increased total cover of salt marsh vegetation two years later, but that removing &lt;50% of invading mangrove trees had no clear effect.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
