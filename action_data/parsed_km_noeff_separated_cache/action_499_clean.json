  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies from Spain and North America found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes, compared to used ones. One study from the USA found that eastern bluebirds showed this preference, but most did not switch from a soiled to a cleaned nest box. One study from the USA found that birds showed an avoidance of heavily-soiled boxes and one from Canada found that tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor preferentially selected nests which were sterilised by microwaving.\nTwo studies from the USA found that eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis and house wrens Troglodytes aedon preferentially nested in uncleaned nest boxes, and one study found that prothonotary warblers Protonotaria citrea showed no preference for cleaned or uncleaned boxes. \nNone of the five studies that investigated it found any difference in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned nest boxes."
