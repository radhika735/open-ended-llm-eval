  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using organic mulch to restore or create brackish/salt marshes. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study on a sandflat in Australia found that mulched and unmulched plots had similar plant species richness over two years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study on a sandflat in Australia found that mulched plots were more likely to contain glasswort Sarcocornia quinqueflora than unmulched plots, after 20 months. However, mulching had no significant effect on glasswort biomass after 20 months, and typically had no significant effect on glasswort cover over two years.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
