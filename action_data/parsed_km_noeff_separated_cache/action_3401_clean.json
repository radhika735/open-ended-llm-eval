  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of sowing seeds of nurse plants on grassland vegetation. The study was in France.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants reduced the similarity of the plant community to that of nearby intact steppe compared to areas where no seeds were sown.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants did not change plant species richness and richness was lower than in nearby intact steppe.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants did not change vegetation cover compared to areas where no seeds were sown.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)"
