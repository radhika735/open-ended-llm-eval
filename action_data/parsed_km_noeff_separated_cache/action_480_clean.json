  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from the UK and the Azores found increases in gull and tern populations following the provision of rafts/islands or providing nest boxes alongside other interventions.\nA controlled, replicated study from the USA found that terns had higher nesting success on nesting rafts in one of two years monitored and a before-and-after study from Japan found that nesting success increased after the provision of nesting substrate.\nFive studies from Canada and Europe found that terns used re-profiled or artificial islands or nesting rafts, but pelicans did not.\nA small study from Hawaii found that red-footed boobies Sula sula preferentially nested in an artificial ‘tree-style’ nesting structure, compared to other designs."
