Both studies were in the UK.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nGrass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased grass species richness.\nForb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased forb species richness.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)"
