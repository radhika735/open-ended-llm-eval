  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf three studies captured, one controlled study from the Netherlands found that warblers nested at lower densities in cut areas of reeds. Productivity and success did not vary between treatments.\nAn unreplicated study from Denmark found that geese grazed at the highest densities on reedbeds cut 5â€“12 years previously.\nOne replicated study investigated changing water levels in addition to cutting reeds in the UK and found that management did not affect great bittern breeding productivity but did appear to delay territory establishment."
