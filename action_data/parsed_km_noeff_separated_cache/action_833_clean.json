  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies (including one replicated, site comparison study) in the UK found that habitat management that included maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations. One replicated, controlled study in Brazil found that keeping rice fields flooded after harvest changed amphibian species composition, but not numbers of species or abundance.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA found that draining ponds, particularly in the summer, significantly increased abundance and numbers of amphibian species.\nOne before-and-after study in the USAÂ found that maintaining pond water levels enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs."
