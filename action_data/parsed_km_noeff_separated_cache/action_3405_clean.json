  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies examined the effects of sowing seeds at a higher density on grassland vegetation. Four studies were in the USA, and one study was in each of the UK and Canada.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density did not increase the similarity of the vegetation community to that of the target community.\nForb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb species richness.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density did not alter the cover of sown plant species.\nGrass abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased grass cover.\nForb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb cover.\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs.\nIndividual plant species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased the cover of thickspike wheatgrass.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings."
