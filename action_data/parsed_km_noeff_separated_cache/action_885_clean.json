  "action_title": "Use grazing instead of cutting for pasture or grassland management",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated trial) from Australia and the UK found grazing instead of cutting had mixed effects on natural enemies, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One replicated study from New Zealand found no effect. Pests and diseases: One of five studies (including three replicated trials) from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA found more pests, and two studies found effects varied between pest groups and sampling dates. Two studies found no effect on pests. One study found no effect on disease when grazing was used in addition to cutting. Pasture damage and plant survival: One randomised study found more ryegrass shoots were attacked by pests. One study found lower survival of alfalfa plants but another found no effect. Yield: One of four randomised, replicated studies (one also controlled) found lower yields and two found no effect. One study found lower ryegrass and higher clover yields, but no difference between clover varieties. Another randomised study found more ryegrass shoots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, cockâ€™s-foot, perennial ryegrass, other grasses and white clover."
