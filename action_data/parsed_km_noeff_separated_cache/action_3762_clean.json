  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects of altering incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratios on tortoise, terrapin, side-necked and softshell turtle populations. Four studies were in the USA, two were in Columbia and one was in each of Brazil and the Galápagos.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (5 studies): Four studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA, Colombia and the Galápagos found that hatching success of alligator snapping turtle, Magdalena river turtle, western pond turtle and Española giant tortoise eggs varied across the range of temperatures tested. One controlled study in Brazil found that Amazon River turtle nests covered with black plastic sheeting had lower hatching success than uncovered nests.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (8 STUDIES):\n\nOffspring sex ratio (8 studies): Seven studies (including three replicated, randomized studies) in the USA, Colombia and the Galápagos found that hatchling sex ratio of turtles and tortoises was affected by incubation temperature, and that warmer temperatures resulted in more female hatchlings. One controlled study in Brazil found that Amazon River turtle nests covered with black plastic sheeting produced more female hatchlings than uncovered nests."
