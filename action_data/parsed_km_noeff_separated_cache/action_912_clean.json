  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study from Australia found lantana plants in a fire-treated area were smaller and less abundant than an unburned area. One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from India found burned lantana produced fewer new shoots than plants cut to ground level. One replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds, had higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates but more flowering individuals than plants in other lantana-invaded habitats managed by grazing or mechanical control.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled greenhouse trial in India found more lantana seeds germinated and germination rates were higher when seeds were exposed to smoke than seeds not exposed to smoke.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled trial from Australia found two native tree species had higher germination and seedling survival when lantana was burned."
