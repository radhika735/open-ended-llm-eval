  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFifteen studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs for artificial incubation on sea turtle populations. Three studies were in Suriname and the USA, two were in each of Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico and one was in the Cayman Islands.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (12 studies): One of four controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in Suriname, the Dominican Republic, the USA found that kemp’s ridley nests relocated for artificial incubation had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had lower hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that hawksbill turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to natural nests. The other study found that hatching success of leatherback and green turtle nests relocated for artificially incubation was similar to natural nests above the high tide line and may have been higher than for natural nests washed over by sea swells. This study also found higher embryo mortality in artificially incubated nests compared to natural nests. Three studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Mexico and Malaysia found that loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had similar hatching success compared to nests relocated to an on-beach hatchery. One study also found that careful handling of eggs during the first five days of incubation did not affect hatching success. Four studies (including one replicated study) in Surinam, Ascension Island and Costa Rica, the Cayman Islands, the USA and Mexico reported that hatching success of green, loggerhead and olive ridley turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation varied from 26% to &gt;90%. One study also reported that hatching success from two trials was 30% and 58% in foam-packed boxes and 26% and 48% in sand-packed boxes. One study also reported that hatching success was 60–89% in 14 of 18 years. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Costa Rica found that olive ridley turtle eggs artificially incubated in low oxygen conditions had lower hatching success than those in normal oxygen conditions.\nCondition (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Suriname found that leatherback and green turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation had more instances of embryo deformities than natural nests. One randomized, controlled study in Mexico found that relocating olive ridley nests for artificial incubation had mixed effects on hatchling size and movement compared to those relocated to an on-beach hatchery.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nOffspring sex ratio (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including two controlled studies) in Suriname and Malaysia found that green turtle and leatherback turtle nests relocated for artificial incubation produced fewer female hatchlings than eggs from natural nests and/or that all sexed hatchlings that were artificially incubated were male."
