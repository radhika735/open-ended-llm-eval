  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of translocating tuatara on their populations. Three studies were in New Zealand and one was global.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One global review reported that 15 of 47 reptile translocations resulted in stable or growing populations (review included both wild-caught and captive bred animals). One study in New Zealand found that nine years after a translocation of 32 tuatara to an island where they had previously gone extinct, there was a population of 50 individuals.\nReproductive success (2 studies): One of two studies (including one controlled study) in New Zealand reported successful reproduction in one population of translocated tuatara. The other study reported no breeding during the six years following translocation.\nSurvival (2 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in New Zealand reported that 61–73% of translocated tuatara were recaptured over a six year period or survived for 9–12 month following release.\nCondition (1 study): One controlled study in New Zealand found that translocated adult tuatara increased their body weight by 41% following release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
