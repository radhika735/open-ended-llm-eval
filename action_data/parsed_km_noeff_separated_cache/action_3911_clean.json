  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of translocating butterflies and moths to establish populations outside of their known range. Two studies were in the USA and one was in each of the Czech Republic and the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three studies in the USA and the UK reported that populations of Gillette’s checkerspot, small skipper and marbled white translocated outside of their native range as eggs or adults (in one case including captive-bred individuals) persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years. The third study reported that a population of Gillette’s checkerspot adults, eggs and caterpillars translocated outside their native range died out within one year.\nCondition (1 study): One study in the Czech Republic found that 69 years after translocation, an introduced population of the small mountain ringlet butterfly had similar genetic diversity to its source population, and higher genetic diversity than a small native population.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
