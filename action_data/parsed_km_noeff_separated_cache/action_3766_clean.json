  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of maintaining wild-caught, gravid females in captivity during gestation. Two studies were in the USA and New Zealand and one was in each of Japan, Iran and Mexico.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (7 studies): Five replicated studies in the USA, Japan, Iran and Mexico found that varying numbers of wild-caught snakes and lizards gave birth to live young or laid eggs that hatched successfully in captivity. One study also found that eggs laid in artificial nest chambers had higher hatching success than those laid outside of the chambers. One study in New Zealand found mixed effects of providing different basking conditions on the number of McCann’s skinks and common geckos that gave birth successfully. One controlled study in New Zealand found that McCann’s skinks in captivity that were treated for mites completed pregnancy more often and produced more viable offspring compared to skinks not treated.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
