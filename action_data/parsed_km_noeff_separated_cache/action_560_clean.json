  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll four studies (including one replicated, controlled study and one review) from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and unspecified European countries reported a positive effect of crop rotations on ground beetles or plants. Three studies found higher ground beetle species richness and/or abundance and one study found higher plant species richness in rotation fields or on farms with more crops in rotation compared to monoculture fields. \nA study from Hungary found that fields in monoculture had a more stable and abundant ground beetle community than fields within a rotation."
