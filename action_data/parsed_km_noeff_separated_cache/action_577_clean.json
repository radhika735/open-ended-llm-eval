  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll five translocation programmes studied were for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in the southern USA.\nSix studies of four programmes found that &gt;50% of translocated birds remained in their new sites, with two studies of the same programme reporting a large population increase.\nBirds from four programmes were reported as forming pairs or breeding, although some translocated pairs split up and some translocated nestlings were abandoned.\nOne study found that translocated nestlings fledged at similar rates to native chicks."
