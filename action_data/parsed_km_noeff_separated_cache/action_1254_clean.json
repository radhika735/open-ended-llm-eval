  "action_title": "Fence to prevent grazing after tree planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour of five studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Australia, Canada , Finland and the USA found that using fences to exclude grazing increased the survival, size and cover of planted trees. Two studies found no effect on tree survival rate and one found mixed effects on planted tree size depending on the structure of the fence."
