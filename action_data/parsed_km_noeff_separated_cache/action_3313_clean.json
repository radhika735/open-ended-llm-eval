  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Canada.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch after planting wetland herbs typically had no significant effect on total live vegetation biomass, two growing seasons later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that adding surface mulch increased the cover of one of two planted herb species (creeping alkaligrass Puccinellia phryganodes) but had no significant effect on cover of the other species (estuary sedge Carex subspathacea). Cover was monitored over the second growing season after planting/mulching.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch had no significant effect on the survival of two of two planted herb species, after two growing seasons."
