  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of active water level management in freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study of a swamp/marsh in the USA found that overall plant diversity was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One site comparison study of floodplain swamps in the USA found that an artificial flood had no significant effect on tree seedling density in a low and very wet swamp, but increased tree seedling density in a drier swamp higher on the floodplain.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study of a swamp/marsh in the USA reported mixed responses of individual plant species’ cover to active water level management. However, the study found that cover of the dominant woody species, Pacific willow Salix lucida, was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
