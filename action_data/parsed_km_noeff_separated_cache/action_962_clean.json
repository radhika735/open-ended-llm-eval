  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of agri-environment schemes on bat populations. The three studies were in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, paired sites studies in the UK found that overall bat activity (relative abundance) or the occurrence of six bat species did not differ significantly between farms managed under agri-environment schemes and those managed conventionally. One of the studies found that agri-environment scheme farms had similar activity of five bat species, and lower activity of one bat species, compared to conventional farms. The other study found lower overall bat activity and activity of pipistrelle species on agri-environment scheme farms than conventional farms.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
