  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of freshwater wetlands – of soaking them before planting. The study was in a greenhouse in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nBiomass/plant (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that soaking black willow Salix nigra cuttings before planting had no significant effect on the above-ground biomass of surviving seedlings, over the 48 days after planting.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that the effect, on survival, of soaking black willow cuttings before planting depended on the water regime after planting. However, all cuttings soaked for 15 days before planting died within 42 days of planting."
