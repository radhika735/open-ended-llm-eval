  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo controlled, replicated trials from Spain and the United Kingdom (one also randomized) measured the effect of adding composts to soil. One trial found applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss, but increased nutrient loss. One trial found improved nutrient retention and increased barley Hordeum vulgare yield when molasses were added.\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: sandy-clay, sandy loam, silty-clay."
