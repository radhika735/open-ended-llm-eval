  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing an organism (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants. The study was in a fen meadow.\nPlant community composition (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen meadow in Belgium found that introducing a parasitic plant altered the overall plant community composition.\nVegetation cover (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant reduced cover of the dominant sedge but increased moss cover.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant increased overall plant species richness."
