  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf five studies found, one replicated and controlled study from the USA found that forest plots provided with snags had higher bird diversity and abundance than plots without snags added.\nThree studies from the USA and UK found that woodpeckers and other species used artificially-created snags for nesting and foraging. One study from the USA found that use increased with how long a snag had been dead.\nA UK study found that no crested tits used snags created for them, possibly because they were not rotted enough, or because they were too close to the ground."
