  "action_title": "Floating pennywort: Environmental control (e.g. shading, reduced flow, reduction of rooting depth, or dredging)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the potential for environmental control of floating pennywort using shading, increased flow, reduction of rooting depth to below 1 metre, or dredging.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
