  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated (one controlled) studies from the USA found higher species richnesses on sites with grazers excluded. Of these one found significant differences for two vertebrate-predating birds: Le Conte’s thrasher, Toxostoma lecontei and loggerhead shrike, Lanius ludovicianus; the other found a significant increase in the abundance of Gray Hawk, Asturina nitida.\nOne controlled, replicated site comparison study from the USA found that overall bird abundance, and bird species richness were higher in sites with grazers excluded. Vertebrate-predating birds were either recorded only on grazed sites (Red‐tailed Hawk, American Kestrel, Prairie Falcon) or only on exclosure sites (Northern Harrier and Short‐eared Owl)."
