  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of installing physical supports for emergent, non-woody plants planted in freshwater wetlands. The study was in the Netherlands.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nBiomass/plant (1 study): One replicated, controlled study at the edge of a freshwater lake in the Netherlands found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on biomass of individual plants after 1–2 years.\nStems/plant (1 study): The same study found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on number of shoots/plant after 1–2 years."
