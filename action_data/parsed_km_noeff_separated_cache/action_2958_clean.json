  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/removing/thinning forest plantations to restore freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA reported that the effect of thinning/clearing forest plantations on wetland-characteristic plant species richness depended on soil moisture. After three growing seasons, wetter thinned/cleared sites generally contained more wetland-characteristic plant species than drier thinned/cleared sites or sites that remained afforested.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
