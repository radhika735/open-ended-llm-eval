  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of drill seeding rather than sowing by hand on grassland vegetation. The studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were paired) in the USA found that sowing seeds with a seed drill did not alter plant species richness. The other study found mixed effects.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (3 studies): One of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were randomized and one paired) in the USA found that sowing seeds with a seed drill increased the density of two sown grass species compared to sowing by hand. The two other studies found that in most cases sowing seeds with a seed drill led to no change or a reduction in the abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding or sowing by hand.\nGrass abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing grassland seeds with a seed drill increased the abundance of warm-season grass species compared to sowing by hand.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)"
