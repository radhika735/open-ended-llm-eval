  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of grazing with mixed livestock. All three studies were in the UK and compared grazing with sheep and cattle to sheep only.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had fewer moth species than plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies and one paired, site comparison study) in the UK found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had a similar abundance of moth caterpillars and small invertebrates including caterpillars to plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only. One of these studies found that in plots grazed at high intensity, the abundance of small invertebrates including caterpillars was lower in plots with sheep and cattle than in sheep only plots. The other study found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had a lower abundance of adult moths than plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
