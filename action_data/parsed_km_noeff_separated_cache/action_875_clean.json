  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo of three studies (including two replicated studies) in Denmark, Sweden and the USA found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, in one case at 70% of sites. One of the studiesÂ found that populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads.\nTwo studies in Puerto Rico found that survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low and that 25% were predated within two days of release."
