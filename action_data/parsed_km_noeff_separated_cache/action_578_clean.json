  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies of two translocation programmes from the Pacific and New Zealand found that populations of parrots were successfully established on islands following translocations, including the colonisation of other islands in the New Zealand study.\nSurvival of translocated birds was monitored in five studies of four programmes from across the world and ranged from 41% over 60 days for red-fronted parakeets Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae in New Zealand to 98% for kakapos Strigops habroptila in New Zealand.\nSurvival for translocated thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha in the USA was higher than for captive-bred birds.\nDespite very high survival, kakapos that were translocated had very low reproductive output in New Zealand."
