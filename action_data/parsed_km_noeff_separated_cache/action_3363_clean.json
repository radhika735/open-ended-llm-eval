  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of soaking their seeds before sowing. The study was in a greenhouse in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that soaking bulrush seeds in water before sowing typically had no significant effect on their germination rate – especially amongst seeds that had not been manipulated in any other way before soaking."
