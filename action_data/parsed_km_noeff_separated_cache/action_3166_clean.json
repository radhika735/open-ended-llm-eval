  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation in freshwater marshes, of modifying crop farming practices in the watershed to reduce pollution. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by abandoning cropland in the watershed (along with removing topsoil from the marshes) contained a different overall plant community, after 1–12 years, to both natural and degraded marshes nearby.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that freshwater marshes being restored by abandoning cropland in the watershed (along with removing topsoil from the marshes) contained fewer wetland plant species, after 1–12 years, than nearby natural marshes.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
