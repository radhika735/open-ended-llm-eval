  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nPlants (3 studies)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, and controlled studies in wetlands in the USA found higher cover of some species of plants, herbaceous plants, or native plants in areas grazed by cattle at lower, compared to higher, intensities. A replicated, randomized, controlled study in forested pastures in central California, USA, found no difference in plant cover on stream banks and surrounding grass between pastures moderately and intensively grazed by cattle.\nDiversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in wetland in the USA and Israel found lower plant diversity in sites with low grazing intensity compared to medium grazing intensity and also found higher diversity in some comparisons and lower diversity in others. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in wet grasslands in the USA found that plant community composition differed in sites with different cattle-grazing intensities, in some comparisons."
