  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated before-and-after study from the UK found that there was a very large increase in loon productivity on lakes provided with nesting rafts, with a corresponding increase in productivity across the whole country.\nTwo studies from the USA found higher nesting success on lakes with floatingÂ  nesting rafts, compared to sites without rafts, but no new territories were established on lakes without loons but with rafts.\nA replicated study from the UK found that loons used nesting rafts and artificial islands in some areas of the UK, but not others."
