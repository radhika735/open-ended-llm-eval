  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled laboratory study in New Zealand found that the application of dichlobenil reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.\nTwo replicated, randomized, controlled field studies in Portugal and New Zealand found that the application of dichlobenil reduced cover less than the combined application of the herbicides 2,4-D and MCPA eight days after treatment but not 45 days after treatment and that plants treated with dichlobenil presented lower vegetation cover soon after herbicide application but cover later increased to levels close to pre-treatment.\nThree laboratory studies (including two replicated, controlled studies and one randomized, controlled study) in the USA found that the herbicides imazamox and imazapyr reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled field study in Portugal and one replicated, controlled, laboratory study in the USA reported reduced parrot’s feather biomass after treatment with glyphosate. One replicated, randomized, controlled field study in Portugal found that the application of gluphosinate-ammonium reduced the biomass of parrot’s feather.\nThree replicated, controlled laboratory studies in New Zealand and the USA found that treatment with fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth of parrot’s feather.\nOne replicated, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that the application of flumioxazin reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that the application of florpyrauxifen-benzyl reduced the growth of parrot’s feather."
