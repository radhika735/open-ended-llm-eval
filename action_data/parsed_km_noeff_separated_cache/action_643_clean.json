  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot. A study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys. \nA replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures."
