  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/saline wetlands before planting trees/shrubs. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on an estuarine mudflat in Australia found that ploughing the substrate before planting grey mangrove Avicennia marina propagules had no significant effect on their height after two growing seasons.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on an estuarine mudflat in Australia found that ploughing the substrate before planting grey mangrove propagules had no significant effect on their survival over two growing seasons."
