  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of limiting vessel speeds on reptiles. One study was in each of Australia, Costa Rica and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nÂ \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that in waterways with enforced speed limits, fewer spectacled caiman were found dead with boat-related injuries compared to waterways with no speed limits. One replicated study in the USA found that vessels travelling at lower speeds caused fewer catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells, though vessels with jet motors caused no catastrophic injuries at any speed tested.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that in waterways with enforced speed limits, fewer spectacled caiman were found with boat-related injuries compared to waterways with no speed limits.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated study in Australia found that green turtles were more likely to flee from vessels travelling at lower speeds."
