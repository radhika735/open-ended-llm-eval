  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWeed weight and cover: Nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA tested the effects of planting species to compete with weeds. All (including four replicated, randomised, controlled trials) found reduced weed plant weight or ground cover, although two found this only in some years or conditions. Weed reproduction and survival: Five studies (including three replicated, randomised, controlled trials) also found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both. One of these found an effect only in one year only.\nCrops studied were clovers, fescues, ryegrass, other grasses and turnip."
