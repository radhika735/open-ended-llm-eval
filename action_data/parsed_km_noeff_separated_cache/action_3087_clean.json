  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of controlling problematic plants in freshwater marshes or swamps using &gt;3 combined interventions. The study was in Costa Rica.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that coverage of live vegetation stands was lower in a plot where southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years than in a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had greater plant species richness than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had less live vegetation cover than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
