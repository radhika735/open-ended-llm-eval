  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange to restore/create brackish/saline swamps from other land uses or habitat types. One study was in Australia and one was in Thailand.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY                             \n\nOverall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in an estuary in Australia reported that the area of mangrove forest on an island was greater 3–9 years after restoring full tidal exchange than in the years before.\nTree/shrub richness/diversity (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove tree species that spontaneously colonized in the six years after restoring full tidal exchange (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove trees, by species, that spontaneously colonized in the six years after restoring full tidal exchange (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
