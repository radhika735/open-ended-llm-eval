  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study in Mauritius describes the establishment of a population of Mauritius fody Foudia rubra following the release of captive-bred individuals.\nFour studies of three release programmes on Hawaii found high survival of all three species released (Hawaiian crows Corvus hawaiiensis and two thrushes: omao Myadestes obscurus and puaiohi M. palmeri), with the two thrushes successfully breeding. The authors in one note that many of the released puaiohi dispersed from the release site, meaning that repopulating specific areas may require multiple releases.\nA replicated, controlled study from the USA found that San Clemente loggerhead shrike Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi pairs with captive-bred females had lower reproductive success than pairs where both parents were wild-bred."
