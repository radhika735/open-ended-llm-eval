  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\n Four studies from the USA found that three species of hummingbird showed preferences for higher concentrations of sucrose (measured in weight/volume), consuming more and visiting feeders more frequently. \n A study from the USA found that black-chinned hummingbirds Archilochus alexanderi preferentially fed on sugar solutions over artificial sweeteners, and that increasing the viscosity of these solutions (so they appeared more like sugar solutions) did not affect their consumption. \n Two studies from Mexico (ex situ) and Argentina found that four species showed preferences for sucrose over fructose or glucose when equiweight solutions were compared.  One found that birds also preferentially fed on sucrose over a sucrose-glucose mix, the other found no preference for sucrose over a glucose-fructose mix. \nA controlled study from the USA found that Anna’s hummingbirds Calypte anna showed a preference for red-dyed sugar solutions over five other colours, but only if different colours were presented at the same time.\nA replicated study from the USA found that rufous hummingbirds Selasphorous rufus preferentially fed on feeders placed higher, over lower ones."
