  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty-four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting emergent, non-woody plants in freshwater wetlands. Sixteen studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Guam, the Netherlands, Israel, Ireland, the UK, Italy, Australia and China. Two pairs of studies in Minnesota and South Dakota took place in the same area but used different experimental set-ups.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their near-shore plant community became more similar to that behind mature natural rush stands.\nOverall richness/diversity (9 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled) in freshwater marshes in China and the USA reported that planting herbs increased plant species richness and/or diversity for up to five years. Two controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that planted and unplanted sites had similar plant species richness after 2–3 years. Three studies in the USA, the UK and Australia compared plant species richness in marshes that had been planted with herbs (sometimes along with other interventions) and natural marshes, and reported that it was never higher in planted marshes. Three studies involving freshwater marshes in Guam, the USA and Italy simply quantified plant species richness for up to 13 years after planting herbs (along with other interventions).\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with wetland-characteristic herbs had a similar richness of wetland-characteristic plant species, after three years, to unplanted plots.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (4 studies): One before-and-after study of a freshwater marsh and wet meadow in China found that vegetation cover was greater five years after planting herbs than in the year before planting. One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with herbs had similar overall vegetation cover, after three years, to unplanted plots. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia found that as planted rush stands aged, the density of plants in adjacent near-shore vegetation became more similar to mature natural stands. One study in a freshwater marsh in the USA simply quantified vegetation cover and density over 1–9 years after planting herbs (along with other interventions).\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with wetland-characteristic herbs had greater cover of wetland-characteristic plants, after three years, than unplanted plots.\nIndividual species abundance (13 studies): Thirteen studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that both planted herb species had greater cover in planted than unplanted plots, after three years. Three studies in the UK, the USA and Australia compared the abundance of herb species where they had been planted to their abundance in natural marshes: two found that the planted species was more dense in planted than natural areas after 5–14 years, and one found that planted rush stands became more dense (i.e. more like natural stands) as they aged.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nOverall structure (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their width increased – becoming more like mature natural stands.\nHeight (4 studies): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their maximum height increased – becoming more like mature natural stands. One before-and-after study of a freshwater marsh and wet meadow in China found that vegetation was taller five years after planting herbs than in the year before planting. One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow were shorter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions). One replicated study in wet basins in the USA simply reported an increase in the average height of a herb species over three growing seasons after it was planted.\nDiameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow had a smaller perimeter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions).\nBasal area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that the basal area of sedge tussocks was lower in a restored meadow than in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions).\nIndividual plant size (2 studies): Two replicated studies in wet meadow restoration sites in the USA reported that the size of Carex stricta seedlings increased over two months or three growing seasons after planting. This was true for the average number of shoots/plant and biomass/plant.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (14 studies): Nine studies (eight replicated) in the USA and Israel quantified survival rates of individual herbs planted in freshwater wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 1–3 growing seasons. Eight studies (including five replicated and two before-and-after) in Guam, the USA, the Netherlands and Israel reported 0% survival or absence of planted (or sown) herb species, in at least some cases, after three months to seven years. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, herbivory, time of planting and plug type.\nGrowth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual herbs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The two studies (one replicated) in Ireland and the USA reported that herbs grew over 1–2 growing seasons after planting."
