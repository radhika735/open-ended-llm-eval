  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effects of translocating snakes and lizards away from threats on their populations. Four studies were in the UK, two were in New Zealand, one was in each of South Africa and the USA and one was global.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One review of lizard mitigation translocation projects in New Zealand found that one of 28 projects found evidence of population growth following release. One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, mitigation translocations (both away from threats and of problem reptiles) failed more often than those carried out for conservation or research purposes. One replicated study in South Africa found that 2–5 years after translocating black-headed dwarf chameleons to two sites away from a development site, one site hosted more chameleons than were released, whereas the other hosted less.\nReproductive success (4 studies): One review of lizard mitigation translocation projects in New Zealand found that one of eight projects found evidence of breeding following release. One controlled study in the UK and one replicated study in New Zealand found that following translocation away from a development site or from the threat of poaching, 14–15% of female slow worms and jewelled geckos were found to be gravid within 12–14 months following release. One study in the UK found that following a translocation of 119 adders away from flood defence works, one neonate was observed within six months of release.\nSurvival (6 studies): Five studies (including two replicated studies) in the UK, the USA and New Zealand found that slow worms, common lizards, adders, skinks released in to enclosures and jewelled geckos translocated away from threats survived for varying durations over monitoring periods that lasted from six months to two years. One site comparison study in the UK found that 20 years after slow worms were translocated away from a development site, annual survival was 56% for females and 23% for males.\nCondition (2 studies): One of two studies (including one controlled and one site comparison study) in the UK found that slow worms translocated away from a development site had lower body mass compared to wild individuals. The other study found that 20 years after slow worms were translocated away from a development site, males had higher body condition compared to wild individuals, but juveniles had lower body condition.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
