  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies examined the effects of adding mulch before or after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in Canada, two were in the USA, and one study was in each of the UK and Germany.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not alter the species richness of target plants.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not increase plant cover.\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species.\nSown/planted species abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA and UK found that adding mulch before sowing seeds did not alter the density of six sown plant species in most cases. The other study found that adding mulch before planting seedlings reduced the cover of planted species.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that adding mulch before planting seedlings did not alter the cover of common knapweed.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES) \n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings in most cases.\nGrowth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that adding mulch after planting native prairie plants did not alter the growth of any of seven plant species."
