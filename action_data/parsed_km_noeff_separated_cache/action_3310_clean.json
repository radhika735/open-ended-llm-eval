  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding below-ground organic matter to freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a created wetland in the USA found that amongst plots planted with tree seedlings, those amended with large amounts compost contained a plant community characteristic of drier conditions, three years later, than the community in unamended plots. The lowest compost dose had no significant effect on this outcome.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that amongst plots planted with tree seedlings, those amended with a large amount of compost had lower plant species richness and diversity, three years later, than unamended plots. Lower compost doses had no significant effect on either outcome.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a created wetland in the USA found that amongst plots planted with tree seedlings, those amended with compost supported a similar overall vegetation biomass, three years later, to unamended plots.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nIndividual plant size (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a created wetland in the USA found that birch Betula saplings were larger, three years after planting seedlings, in plots amended with large amounts of compost than in unamended plots."
