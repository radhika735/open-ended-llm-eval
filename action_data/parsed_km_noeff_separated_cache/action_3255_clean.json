  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on naturally colonizing vegetation, of introducing nurse plants to restore or create brackish/saline swamps. The study was in India.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that the average height of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses increased by 21–90% (depending on the species) over the first month after establishment.\n\nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that 60–80% (depending on the species) of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses developed into seedlings. Saltmarsh grasses trapped 1,200–1,372 mangrove propagules/m2/week, approximately 1–2 years after they were planted."
