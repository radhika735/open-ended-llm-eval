  "action_title": "Reduce grazing intensity",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nCompaction: One replicated study from Australia found compacted soils recovered when sheep were excluded for 2.5 years. \nErosion: Two replicated studies from New Zealand and Syria (one also controlled) measured the effect of grazing animals on soil nutrient and sediment loss. Of these, one trial found increased soil carbon and nitrogen when grazing animals were excluded. One trial found higher soil phosphate levels, and less sediment erosion when grazing time in forage crops was reduced.\n \nSOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, clay-loamy, loamy, silt loam."
