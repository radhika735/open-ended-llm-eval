  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effects of sowing seeds at the start of the growing season on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one was in the UK.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (2 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds in spring increased plant diversity compared to sowing in autumn.\nSown/planted richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing seeds in spring increased the number of sown species compared to sowing in autumn.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing seeds in spring increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to sowing in autumn.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY) \n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds in spring led to similar emergence of forb seedlings compared to sowing in winter."
