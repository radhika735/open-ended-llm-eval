  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies from the USA and Europe found reductions in consumption of eggs treated with various chemicals. A further ex situ study from the USA found that American kestrels Falco sparverius consumed fewer chicks when they were treated, but not to the point of losing body condition.\nThree studies from the USA found some evidence that treating eggs with some chemicals may have reduced predation of eggs after treatment stopped, orÂ  of untreated eggs, although two of these were only short term experiments and the third found that the effect was lost after a year. \nFour studies from the Europe and the USA found no evidence for conditioning, or a reduction in predation of wild (untreated) eggs."
