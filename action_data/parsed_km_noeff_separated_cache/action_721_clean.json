  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWeeds: Two of two studies (both randomised, replicated trials, one also controlled) from the USA found reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture. Pests: Five studies from North America measured pests including four randomised, replicated, controlled tests. One study found fewer pests and two studies found reductions in some pest groups or in some pasture mixes. One study found no effect and another found more pests, although the effect was potentially inseparable from grazing treatments. Crop mortality: One randomised, replicated study from the USA found no effect on forage crop mortality caused by nematodes.Yield: Two of five studies (including two randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from North America found increased forage crop yields and two studies found mixed effects depending on the crop type and year. One study found no effect.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, chicory, cicer milkvetch, clovers, fescues, oats, ryegrass, other grasses, other legumes, rapeseed and turnip."
