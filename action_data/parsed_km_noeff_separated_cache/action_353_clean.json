  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe captured four studies examining the impacts of fertilizing grasslands, all from the UK and investigating grazing by geese Anser and Branta spp. Two studies found that more geese grazed on areas that were fertilised compared with control areas. Two studies found that cut and fertilised areas were used more than control areas. One study found that fertilised areas were used less than re-seeded grasslands.\nOne study found that fertilisation affected grazing at applications of 50 kg N/ha, but not 18 kg N/ha. One study found that grazing rates only increased with applications of up to 80 kg.N/ha."
