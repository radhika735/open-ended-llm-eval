  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies (including one replicated study and one review) in Mallorca found that captive-bred midwife toads released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UKÂ found that predator defences were maintained, but genetic diversity reduced in a captive-bred reintroduced population."
