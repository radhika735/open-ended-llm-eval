  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effect, on peatland vegetation, of cleaning waste water before it enters the environment. The study was in a fen.\nCharacteristic plants (1 study): One study in a floating fen in the Netherlands found that after input water began to be cleaned (along with other interventions to reduce pollution), cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels increased.\nVegetation structure (1 study): The same study found that after input water began to be cleaned (along with other interventions to reduce pollution), vascular plant biomass decreased."
