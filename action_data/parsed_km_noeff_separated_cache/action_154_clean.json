  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies from the UK (a before-and-after study and a controlled study) found that the provision of owl nest boxes in farm buildings maintained barn owl nesting and roosting activity and resulted in an increase in population density. A study from the Netherlands found that the barn owl population increased with increased availability of nest boxes.\nA replicated, controlled study in HungaryÂ found that juvenile barn owls fledged from nest boxes were significantly less likely to be recovered alive than those reared in church towers.\nA replicated study from the UK investigating barn owl nest site use, found that the number of occupied nest sites and the proportion breeding decreased from 2001 to 2009, but were unaffected by the number of boxes."
