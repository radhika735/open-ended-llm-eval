  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs for artificial incubation on tuatara populations. Both studies were in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in New Zealand reported that hatching success of tuatara eggs relocated for artificial incubation was 86â€“100%. The other study reported hatching success of 44%.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in New Zealand found that 10 months after hatching, artificially incubated tuatara were larger that those from natural nests.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
