  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in brackish/salt marshes. All four studies were in the USA. Two studies were based on the same experimental set-up.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burned and unburned plots had similar plant species richness over the following 1–3 years. Two studies in saltgrass- or reed-dominated marshes in the USA reported that burned areas had greater plant species richness than unburned areas, after approximately 1–3 years. In one of the studies, burned areas had also been sprayed with herbicide for nine years – and contained more plant species than a nearby natural marsh.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA evaluated the effect of prescribed burning on vegetation cover. One study found that autumn-burned plots had lower overall vegetation cover than unburned plots after 11 months, but one found that winter-burned plots had similar overall vegetation cover to unburned plots after one year. Two of the studies reported that winter-burned plots had less standing dead vegetation cover than unburned plots in the following summer or winter.\nIndividual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than a species being controlled. For example, three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported mixed effects of burning on cover of saltgrass Distichlis spicata: higher in burned than unburned plots in the following summer, lower in burned than unburned plots in the following winter, or mixed effects amongst marsh types. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burning did not reduce cover of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens, compared to cover in unburned plots, over the following 1–3 years. One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh that had been burned for three years (and sprayed with herbicide for nine) contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than an unburned and unsprayed marsh, and a similar amount of smooth cordgrass to a nearby natural marsh.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nVisual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in brackish and salt marshes in the USA found that the visual obstruction caused by vegetation (combination of height and horizontal cover) was similar in burned and unburned plots, after 11 months.\nHeight (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA found that in a marsh burned for two years (and sprayed with herbicide for nine), the dominant plant species (smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora) grew to a similar height as in a nearby natural marsh."
