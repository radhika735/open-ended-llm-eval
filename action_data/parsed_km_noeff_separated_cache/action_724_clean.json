  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya tested the effects of growing plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Three (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trail) found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and one found that the attractive plant also attracted natural enemies in lab studies. One found no effect on parasitism but the plant used was found not to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies. Pests: All four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage in plots with plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Yield: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals.\nCrops studied were lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum."
