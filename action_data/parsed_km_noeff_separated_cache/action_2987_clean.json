  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of backfilling canals or trenches in freshwater marshes. All three studies were in the USA. There was overlap in the canals used in two of the studies.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (3 studies): Three replicated studies in freshwater marshes in the USA reported coverage of emergent marsh vegetation between 6 months and 25 years after backfilling. All three studies reported that coverage was greater on former spoil areas alongside canals than within the partly filled canal channels.\nRelative abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a freshwater marsh in the USA reported that in levelled former spoil areas alongside backfilled canals, the relative abundance of some key plant species differed from natural marshland. Vegetation was surveyed three years after backfilling.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
