  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of harvest in freshwater swamps (or harvesting at different intensities). The study was in China.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater swamp in China reported that overall herb biomass was statistically similar in plots logged at different intensities five years previously.\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): The same study reported that overall tree biomass was greatest in plots logged at the lowest intensity five years previously. In contrast, overall shrub biomass was greatest in plots logged at medium intensity.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the density of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nDiameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater swamp in China reported that the diameter of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity.\nBasal area (1 study): The same study reported that the basal area of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity."
