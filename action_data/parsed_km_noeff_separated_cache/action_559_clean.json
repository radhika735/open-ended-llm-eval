  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies from across the world, including a literature review from across the world found evidence for positive effects of calcium supplementation on several bird species. \nPositive effects included lower incidence of bone disease, higher fledging succes, larger broods, higher quality eggs or chicks and better physical condition of female parents. Not all species reacted similarly.\nSix studies including a literature review did not find any evidence for increased reproductive success in at least one of the species supplied with supplementary calcium.\nOne replicated study from Europe found that birds took calcium supplied, and birds at polluted sites took more than those at cleaner sites. The effects on fitness were not monitored."
