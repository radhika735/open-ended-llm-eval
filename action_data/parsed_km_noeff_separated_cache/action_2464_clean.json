  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals to islands without invasive predators. The six studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): A study in Australia found that following release of captive-bred dibblers on to an island free of introduced predators, numbers increased. A replicated study in Australia found that following release of captive-bred and wild-born brush-tailed bettong onto islands free of foxes or cats, numbers increased on two of four islands.\nReproductive success (3 studies): A study in Australia found that captive-bred proserpine rock-wallabies released on an island without introduced predators established a breeding population. Two studies in Australia found that following release on to islands without invasive predators, captive-bred rufous hare-wallabies and captive-bred dibblers.\nSurvival (3 studies): A review of 28 translocation studies in Australia found that 67% of marsupial populations translocated to islands without predators survived more than five years, compared to 0% translocated to islands with predators and 20% translocated to the mainland. A study in Australia found that most captive-bred rufous hare-wallabies released on an island without non-native predators survived more than a year. A replicated study in Australia found that wild-born golden bandicoots descended from translocated populations released onto two predator-free islands persisted for 2–3 years.\nCondition (1 study): A replicated study in Australia found that wild-born golden bandicoots descended from translocated populations that had been released onto two predator-free islands, maintained genetic diversity relative to founder and source populations.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
