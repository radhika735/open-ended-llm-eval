Both studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled study in AustraliaÂ found that training greater bilbies to avoid introduced predators did not increase their post-release survival.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One of two controlled studies in Australia found that greater bilbies trained to avoid introduced predators showed more predator avoidance behaviour, the second study found no difference in behaviour between trained and untrained bilbies."
