Two studies found that fire decreased new tree density. Eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species, location and fire frequency.\nTwo of the above studies found mixed effects of prescribed fire on species diversity of young trees depending on the location.\nTwo replicated, controlled studies from the USA found mixed effects of prescribed fire on the survival of young trees."
