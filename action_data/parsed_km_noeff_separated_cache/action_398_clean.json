  "action_title": "Physically protect nests with individual exclosures/barriers or provide shelters for chicks of waders",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree of 13 studies from the USA found higher productivity from nests protected by individual barriers than unprotected nests. Two studies from the USA and Sweden found no higher productivity from protected nests.\nEight studies from the USA and Europe found higher hatching rates, or survival, or low predation of nests protected by individual barriers, although two of these found that higher hatching rates did not result in higher productivity. Two small studies from North America found no differences in predation or survival rates between protected and unprotected nests. \nA meta-analysis from the USA found that there were differences in the effectiveness of different exclosure designs."
