  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs for artificial incubation on snake populations. Two studies were in Australia and one was in each of Japan and China.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (4 studies): Two studies in Australia reported that 87% of carpet python eggs and 83% of brown tree snake eggs hatched successfully following artificial incubation. One study also reported that zero of 10 artificially incubated Oenpelli python eggs hatched. One study in Japan reported that 265 habu eggs hatched successfully following artificial incubation. One replicated, randomized study in China found that hatching success of artificially incubated stripe-tailed ratsnake eggs was lowest at the coolest and warmest temperatures tested.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nOffspring sex ratio (1 study): One study in Japan reported that artificially incubated habu eggs produced offspring with an even sex ratio."
