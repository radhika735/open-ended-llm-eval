  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of maintaining traditional orchards on butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar community composition of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards.\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards. One controlled study in the USA found that an unmanaged and a partially managed orchard had a greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than a commercially managed orchard.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
