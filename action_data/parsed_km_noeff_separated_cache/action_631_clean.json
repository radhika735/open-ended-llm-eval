  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated study from Sweden and a small study from France found that birds sourced from populations distant from where they were released were less successful than birds from the area.\nIn Sweden, released white storks Ciconia ciconia from North Africa produced fewer than half the chicks as those that naturally re-colonised, whilst both studies found that storks and little bustards Tetrax tetrax were less likely to migrate than birds originating in the release area."
