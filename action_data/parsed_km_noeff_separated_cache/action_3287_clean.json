  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in brackish/saline wetlands before planting emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuarine salt marsh in the USA found that amongst plots sown/planted with dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii, those that had been excavated into depressions had lower cover of dominant pickleweed Salicornia virginica – over the first growing season – than plots left at ground level.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuarine salt marsh in the USA found that there were no more (sometimes fewer) dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii seedlings in excavated depressions than in level plots, two months after sowing saltwort seeds.\n\n\nSurvival (1 study): The same study found that the survival rate of dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii transplants was not greater (sometimes lower) in excavated depressions than in level plots."
