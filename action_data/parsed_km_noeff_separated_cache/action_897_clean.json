  "action_title": "Grow cover crops beneath the main crop (living mulches) or between crop rows",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One randomized, replicated study from Spain found that cover crops increased bacterial numbers and activity.\nErosion: Two studies from France and the USA showed reduced erosion under cover crops. One controlled study showed that soil stability was highest under a grass cover, and one randomized replicated study found that cover crops reduced soil loss.\nSoil organic matter: Two controlled trials from India and South Africa (one also randomized and replicated) found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, and one trial from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels.\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: gravelly-sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy, silty loam."
