  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of setting and enforcing vessel speed limits. One study was in the Indian River estuarine system (USA) and the other in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the Indian River estuarine system found similar numbers of manatee deaths before and after vessel speed limits were set in ‘zones’, but fewer deaths were recorded after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. One before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
