The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in an estuarine salt marsh in Australia found that areas where sods of saltwater couch Sporobolus virginicus were transplanted had a similar overall plant community composition to areas without transplants, after 3–4 years. The plant community in the transplanted areas was &gt;70% similar to natural areas in only 4 of 12 comparisons.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
