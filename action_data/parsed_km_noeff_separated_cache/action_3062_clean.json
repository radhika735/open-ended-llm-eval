  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing plant litter from freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted marshes in the USA found that plots cleared of plant litter contained a plant community characteristic of wetter conditions than uncleared plots after one growing season – but not after two.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that plots cleared of plant litter contained a similar number of wetland plant species to uncleared plots, after 1–2 growing seasons.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE                                                         \n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted marshes in the USA found that plots cleared of plant litter had greater cover of wetland plants than uncleared plots after one growing season – but not after two.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
