  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study from Costa Rica found that the local population of scarlet macaws Ara macao increased following the installation of nest boxes along with several other interventions.\nFive studies from South and Central America and Mauritius that nest boxes were used by several species of parrots, with one finding an increase in use over time until the majority of the population used them. One replicated study from Peru found that blue-and-yellow macaws Ara ararauna only used modified palms, not ‘boxes’, whilst another replicated study found that scarlet macaws Ara macao used both PVC and wooden boxes, but that PVC lasted much longer.\nFour studies from Venezuela and Columbia found that several species very rarely, if ever, used nest boxes.\nSix studies from Central and South America found that parrots nested successfully in nest boxes, with two species showing higher levels of recruitment into the population following nest box erection and another finding that success rates for artificial nests were similar to natural nests.\nThree studies from South America found that artificial nests had low success rates, in two cases due to poaching."
