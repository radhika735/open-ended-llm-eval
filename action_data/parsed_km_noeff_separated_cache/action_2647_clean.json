  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving coarse woody debris in forests. One study was in Canada, one was in the USA and one was in Malaysia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study, in Malaysia found more small mammal species groups in felled forest areas with woody debris than without.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One out of three replicated studies (two controlled, one site comparison, one before-and-after) in Canada, the USA and Malaysia found that retaining or adding coarse woody debris did not increase numbers or frequency of records of small mammals. The other study found that two of three shrew species were more numerous in areas with increased volumes of coarse woody debris than areas without coarse woody debris.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
