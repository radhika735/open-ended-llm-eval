  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of offsetting habitat loss from human activity by restoring or creating habitats elsewhere on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. One study was in the Delaware Bay (USA), the other in the Persian Gulf (Kuwait).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One study in the Persian Gulf found that an area of low ecological value restored to offset habitat lost to land reclamation was colonized by over 198 invertebrate species.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY) \n\nBiological production (1 study): One study in Delaware Bay found that an artificial reef built to offset lost soft-sediment habitat had higher annual secondary production/unit area from sessile invertebrates, but lower total annual secondary production, compared to habitat similar to that lost."
