  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies) in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North AmericaÂ found that partial harvest, which included harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning and shelterwood harvesting, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting\nTwo studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs were similar and proportion of eggs per female and juveniles similar or lower in harvested plots that included harvest of groups of trees."
