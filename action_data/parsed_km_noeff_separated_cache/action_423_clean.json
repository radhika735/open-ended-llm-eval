  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll four studies we captured describe the management of red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in open pine forests in the USA.\nOne small study found an increase in woodpecker population following the removal of southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans, whilst a second found a population increase following squirrel removal, along with other interventions and a third found that reintroductions wereÂ  successful when squirrels were controlled.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled before-and-after study found fewer holes were occupied by squirrels following control efforts, but that occupancy by red-cockaded woodpeckers was no higher."
