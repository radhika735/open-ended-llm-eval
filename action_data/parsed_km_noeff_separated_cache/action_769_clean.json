  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of using gloves on the spread of disease between amphibian populations or individuals. \nA review for Canada and the USA found that there were no adverse effects of handling 22 amphibian species using disposable gloves. However, three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia and AustriaÂ found that deaths of tadpoles were caused by latex gloves for all four species tested, by vinyl gloves for three of five species and by nitrile gloves for the one species tested."
