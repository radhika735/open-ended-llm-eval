The study was on an open coastline in Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAlgal abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in ItalyÂ found that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of the topography depth.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
