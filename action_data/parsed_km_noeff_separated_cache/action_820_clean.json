  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, site comparison study in the UKÂ found that populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with a statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas. One before-and-after study in the UK found that a common frog population increased but common toads decreased following the protection of a pond during development."
