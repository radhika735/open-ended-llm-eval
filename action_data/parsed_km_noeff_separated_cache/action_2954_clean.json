  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on freshwater marsh vegetation, of flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years. The study was in Brazil.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period affected the overall community composition of wetland plants, but that the nature of the effect depended on when fields were surveyed.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period had no significant effect on wetland plant species richness per site and per survey, although fewer species were recorded in the flooded fields over the year of the study.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
