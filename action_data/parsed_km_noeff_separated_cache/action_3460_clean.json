  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. The study was in a port in the Netherlands.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. The flexible habitats themselves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
