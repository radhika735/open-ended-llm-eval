  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of lowering the water level to restore/create freshwater marshes from other land uses or habitat types. One study was in the USA and one was in the Netherlands.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study of a freshwater wetland in the USA reported that following a drawdown of water levels, emergent vegetation coverage increased in areas that were previously open water.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study at the edge of a freshwater lake in the Netherlands reported that following a drawdown of the lake water level, vegetation cover developed in areas that were previously open water. Cover varied between years and elevations.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
