  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies from across the world found high success rates for artificial incubation and hand-rearing of raptors.\nA replicated and controlled study from France found that artificially incubated raptor eggs had significantly lower hatching success than parent-incubated eggs. This study found that fledging success for hand-reared chicks was similar to wild chicks, whilst a replicated and controlled study from Canada found that hand-reared chicks had slower growth and attained a lower weight than parent-reared birds.\nA replicated study from Mauritius found that hand-rearing of wild eggs had higher success than hand-rearing captive-bred chicks.\nThree studies that provided methodological comparisons found that American kestrel Falco sparverius eggs were more likely to hatch at 38.5oC, compared to 36oC or 40oC, that peregrine falcon F. peregrinus eggs should be incubated over 37oC and that falcon chicks gained far more weight when saline was added to their diet."
