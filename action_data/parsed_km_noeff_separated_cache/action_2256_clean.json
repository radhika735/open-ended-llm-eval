  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of covering subsea cables with materials that encourage the accumulation of natural sediments on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects."
