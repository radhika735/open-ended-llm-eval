  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using hormones and/or other drugs during captive-breeding programmes to induce reproduction/birth. Three studies were in each of the USA and New Zealand and one study was in each of the Netherlands, China and Japan.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (9 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies (including one before-and-after study) in the USA and China found that plains gartersnakes, eastern painted turtles and red-eared sliders induced with oxytocin produced a similar percentage of live young compared to individuals that were not induced and laid eggs with similar hatching success or laid a similar number of eggs compared to what was observed in wild nests. The other study found that 25% of eggs from hormone-injected (luteinizing hormone and gonadotropin) four-eyed turtles were fertile, compared to 7â€“52% for females that were not injected or injected with a saline solution. One study also found mixed effects of different combinations of hormones and other drugs on inducing 13 turtle species. Five studies (including one before-and-after study) in the Netherlands, New Zealand and Japan found that oxytocin, arginine vasotocin and follicle-stimulating hormone induced egg laying/birth in yellow-headed box turtles, tuatara and common geckos or ovulation in hawksbill turtles. One study also found that only one yellow-headed box turtle female produced fertile eggs.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
