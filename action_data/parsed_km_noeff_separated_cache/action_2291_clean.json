  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nPlants (8 studies)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): Four studies (one meta-analysis; three replicated, randomized, and controlled studies) in grasslands in Israel and the USA found that the cover of native or non-native plants, or the abundance of plants, differed between sites grazed at different times, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study from a former farmland in Spain found no difference in plant cover between areas grazed at different times.\nDiversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in Israel found differences in the number and/or diversity of plant species between plots that were grazed at different times, in some comparisons.\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USA found differences in tree survival between plots grazed at different times. Another one found no difference in bunchgrass survival between plots grazed at different times."
