  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of managing forest and woodland to encourage understorey growth on bat populations. The study was in Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One paired sites study in Germany found more bat species and higher bat diversity in a forest managed to encourage understorey growth than in a managed forest without understorey growth.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One paired sites study in Germany found higher overall bat activity (relative abundance) in a forest managed to encourage understorey growth than in a managed forest without understorey growth.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
