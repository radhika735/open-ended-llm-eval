  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of burning freshwater marshes in different seasons or at different times. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater plant species richness than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater overall vegetation cover than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the cover and frequency of some individual plant species responded differently to spring vs summer burning.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
