  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of reducing livestock grazing intensity. This study was in bogs.\nVegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower. Cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower (one species) or unaffected by grazing intensity (one species).\nVegetation structure (1 study): The same study found that vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower."
