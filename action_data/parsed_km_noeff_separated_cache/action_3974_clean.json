  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects of reducing field size on butterflies and moths. Two studies were in Switzerland, and one was in each of Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (5 studies): Two of four replicated, site comparison studies in Sweden, the Czech Republic and Poland and Switzerland found that arable farms (in more diverse landscapes) and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields. The other two studies found that mixed farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a similar species richness of butterflies to areas with larger fields. One before-and-after study in Germany found that after reducing field size by increasing the length of field edges on a farm, along with increasing the area of meadows and field margins, the species richness of butterflies and burnet moths increased.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (4 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies in Sweden, the Czech Republic and Poland and Switzerland found that arable and mixed farms and landscapes with smaller fields had a higher abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than areas with larger fields.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
