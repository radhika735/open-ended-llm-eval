  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of depositing soil/sediment to form the physical structure of brackish/salt marshes (without introducing vegetation). Three studies were in the USA and one study was in Italy. Two studies took place in the same marsh, but in different areas.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One replicated study in a lagoon in Italy quantified the area of vegetation on sediment deposited up to 19 years previously (average six years four months, with 61% vegetation coverage).\nCommunity types (2 studies): Two replicated studies in coastal wetlands in the USA and Italy quantified the coverage of brackish or salt marsh plant communities on sediment deposited up to 19 years previously.\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study on the coast of the USA reported that the composition of the plant community that developed on deposited sediment depended on the time since deposition and the elevation of the sediment. Areas of sediment that were of a similar elevation to natural marshes (or slightly lower) developed (or were developing) a similar overall plant community composition to the natural marshes.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated study in an estuary in the USA reported that 1–2 plant species had colonized areas of deposited sediment after 4–8 years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
