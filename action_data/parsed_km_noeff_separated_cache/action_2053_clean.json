Two studies in the UK and Brazil found that two of five and two of three bats born in captivity successfully gave birth to live young.\nSurvival (8 studies): Seven studies in the USA, UK, Italy and Brazil found that 20–100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from between 10 days to adulthood. One study in New Zealand found that two of five New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat pups born in captivity survived, both of which were hand-reared.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)"
