  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects of breeding boas and pythons in captivity. Five studies were in the USA, two were in the UK and one was in each of Jersey, Australia, India an unknown location and one was a global review.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (11 studies): Five studies in Jersey, the USA and the UK reported that 1–4 female boas produced litters of 3–34 young, though 2–10 young/litter or 38% of young overall were stillborn. One replicated study in the USA reported that a captive breeding programme for ball pythons produced over 5,000 eggs from nearly 800 clutches, with an average hatching success of 81%. Five studies in an unknown location, the USA, Australia, India and the UK reported that female pythons produced clutches of 4–29 eggs, with hatching success of 40–100% or 0–100%.\nSurvival (5 studies): Five studies in the USA, Australia, India and the UK reported that 2–8 captive-bred python hatchlings survived at least two years or 5–8 months, but seven captive-bred emerald tree boas died within three months of birth.\nCondition (1 study): One global review reported on one study on Jamaica boas that found that captive breeding had a negative effect on genetic variation compared to wild populations."
