  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of sowing or planting nurse plants alongside seeding/planting grassland species on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in Europe, one study was in the USA and one was in Kenya.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Slovenia found that sowing a seed mix containing nurse species resulted in a community composition that was less similar to the target community when compared to sowing a seed mix that did not contain nurse species.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Slovenia found that sowing a seed mix containing nurse species did not increase species richness compared to sowing a seed mix that did not contain nurse species.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nGrass abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds of nurse plants alongside that of grassland species did not change grass abundance.\nForb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds of nurse plants alongside that of grassland species did not change forb abundance.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that sowing seeds under nurse plants increased seed germination.\nSurvival (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (one of which was randomized and paired) in Kenya and Spain found that sowing seeds or planting under nurse plants increased survival of planted plants. The other study found that sowing seeds under nurse plants initially increased seedling survival, but there was no difference in survival after two to three years."
