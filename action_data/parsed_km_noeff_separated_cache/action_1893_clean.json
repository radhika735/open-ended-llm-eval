  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated study in Spain found that salamander larvae had higher survival rates when reared at lower temperatures.\nOne replicated study in Germany found that the growth rate and development stage reached by harlequin toad tadpoles was faster at a higher constant temperature rather than a lower and varied water temperature.\nOne replicated study in Australia found that frog tadpoles took longer to reach metamorphosis when reared at lower temperatures.\nOne replicated, controlled study in Iran found that developing eggs reared within a temperature range of 12-25°C had higher survival rates, higher growth rates and lower abnormalities than those raised outside of that range."
