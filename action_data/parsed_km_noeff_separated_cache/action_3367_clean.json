  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of chilling their seeds before sowing. All six studies were in the USA. Five of the studies were in laboratories or greenhouses.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (6 studies): All six replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that chilling (at 1–10°C) seeds of herbaceous plants before sowing either increased or had no significant effect on their germination rate. Within studies, the direction and/or size of the effect depended on factors such as the duration of chilling, species, conditions (light/temperature) after sowing, and sowing site (restored vs natural meadows). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that freezing sawgrass Cladium jamaicense seeds before sowing reduced their germination rate."
