  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effect of providing refuges for birds during harvest or mowing in France and the UK. One replicated study in France found evidence that providing refuges during mowing reduced contact between mowing machinery and unfledged quail and corncrakes. However one replicated controlled study andÂ a review from the UK found that Eurasian skylark did not use nesting refuges more than other areas."
