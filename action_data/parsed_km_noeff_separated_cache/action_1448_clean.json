  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of strategically laying out scent of predators to deter crop-raiding primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
