  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of using herbicide to control problematic plants. The study was in fens.\nPlant community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in fens in the USA found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) changed the overall plant community composition.\nTree/shrub cover (1 study): The same study found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) prevented increases in plant species richness."
