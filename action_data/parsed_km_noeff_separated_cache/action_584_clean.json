  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour small trials from the USA and a replicated study from Chatham Island, New Zealand found some success in relocating nests whilst they were in use.\nHowever, one study from the USA found that only 40% of burrowing owls Athene cunicularia were moved successfully, another found that American kestrels Falco sparverius tolerated movement of their nest, but not repeated disturbance and another found that barn swallow Hirundo rustica may follow their nest as it is slowly moved on a car, but may not stay at the new site."
