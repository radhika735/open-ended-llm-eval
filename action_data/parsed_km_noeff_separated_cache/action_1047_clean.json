  "action_title": "American bullfrog control: Collection of egg clutches",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nDespite reference to removal of egg clutches in some studies using bilge pumps or nets, no evidence was captured on the effects of egg collection on American bullfrogs.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action."
