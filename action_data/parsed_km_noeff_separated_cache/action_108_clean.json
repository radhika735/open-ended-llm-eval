  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated,      randomized, controlled studies from Sweden found providing nest exclosures      offered some benefits to ground-nesting birds. One study found that      protected nests had higher average daily survival rates than unprotected      nests for both common redshank and northern lapwing, however, this study      also reported higher predation of adult redshank on protected nests. One study found that the average hatching rate for      southern dunlin was higher for protected rather than unprotected nests. This      study also found no difference in the      number of fledglings, breeding adults or new recruits      during two periods with and without nest protection."
