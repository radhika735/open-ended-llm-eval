  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEvidence for the effects of replacing fish meal with bacterial protein is mixed.\nTwo replicated, controlled studies in Norway found similar growth rates in salmon fed either a 100% fish meal (control) diet or experimental diets containing up to 25% bacterial protein to replace fish meal. In the diet containing 50% bacterial protein, growth rates were lower compared to the control. \nAnother replicated, controlled study in Norway reported higher growth rates in salmon that were fed diets containing 18% and 36% bacterial protein compared to the control or a diet containing 4.5% bacterial protein."
