  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing organisms (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA. It involved introducing plants to compete with problematic plants.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a petunia-invaded floodplain swamp in the USA found that plots planted with wetland herbs had greater overall plant species richness than unplanted plots, over the year after planting.\nNative/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that planted plots had greater native plant species richness than unplanted plots, over the year after planting.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE"
