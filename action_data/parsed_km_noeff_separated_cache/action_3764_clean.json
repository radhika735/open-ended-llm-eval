  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of altering incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratios on crocodilian populations. Two studies were in Argentina and one was in China.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized study in Argentina found that hatching success of broad-snouted caiman eggs was similar across all temperatures tested.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES):\n\nOffspring sex ratio (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized studies in Argentina found that hatchling sex ratio of broad-snouted caimans was affected by temperature, and that warmer temperatures resulted in fewer females. One replicated study in China found that exposing Chinese alligator eggs to short periods of high temperatures during incubation resulted in fewer female hatchlings."
