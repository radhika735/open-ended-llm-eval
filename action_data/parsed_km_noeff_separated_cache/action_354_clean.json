  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf seven studies captured, one, a before-and-after study from the UK found that two wader species recolonised a site after water levels were raised. A third was found at very high levels. A review from the UK found that high-level agri-environment schemes designed to provide wet habitats were effective at providing habitats for waders and two replicated studies from the UK and Denmark found that northern lapwings were more likely to nest or nested at higher numbers on grasslands with high water levels.\nA replicated and controlled study from Denmark found that Eurasian oystercatchers did not nest at higher densities on fields with raised water levels and that raising water levels had no effect on nesting on restored grassland fields.\nA replicated study from the USA found that predation rate on Cape Sable seaside sparrow nests increased as water levels increased.\nA replicated, controlled and paired sites study from the UK found that birds visited grassland sites with raised water levels at higher rates than other fields. A replicated study from the UK found no differences in feeding rates on sites with raised water levels, compared with control sites."
