  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of translocating marine mammals to re-establish or boost native populations. The four studies were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One replicated study and one review in the North Pacific Ocean found that after translocating Hawaiian monk seals, along with rehabilitation or at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, more than a quarter of the seals reproduced.\nSurvival (4 studies): Two studies (including one replicated and one controlled study) in the North Pacific Ocean found that 50–83% of translocated, and 52% of rehabilitated and translocated, Hawaiian monk seal pups survived for at least one year. One of the studies and one review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocated seal pups had similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites or greater survival rates than non-translocated pups remaining at the original site. One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocating Hawaiian monk seals, along with at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, resulted in more than a quarter of the seals surviving.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups had similar dispersal times to non-translocated seal pups born at release sites."
