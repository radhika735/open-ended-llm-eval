  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of certifying farms and marketing their products as ‘primate friendly’ to sell at a premium on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention aims to certify sustainably farmed products as ‘primate friendly’, and sell them at a premium. Several environmentally and/or socially responsible product certifications already exist, such as ‘FAIRTRADE’, Organic or ‘Rainforest Alliance’ certifications. A gorilla-specific certification, ‘Gorilla Fund Cofee’, was launched aiming to support Rwandan coffee farmers as they develop sustainable alternatives to logging and poaching, two of the largest threats facing mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei, while also raising funds to support gorilla conservation programs in Rwanda (Ellison, 2004). Recently, another certification product, ‘Grauer’s Gorilla Fund Coffee’, was launched using coffee from 3,600 co-operative Congolese farmers and aiming to support Grauer’s gorilla Gorilla beringei graueri conservation in the Congo. Both products are also Fairtrade certified. If succesfull, such schemes could be used as models for other product certifications, such as ‘lemur-friendly’ vanilla production in Madagascar or San Martin titi monkey  Callicebus oenanthe and cocoa production in Peru.\n \nEllison, K.
