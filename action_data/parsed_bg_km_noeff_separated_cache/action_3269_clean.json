  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of transplanting or replacing blocks of brackish/salt marsh vegetation. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in an estuarine salt marsh in Australia found that areas where sods of saltwater couch Sporobolus virginicus were transplanted had a similar overall plant community composition to areas without transplants, after 3–4 years. The plant community in the transplanted areas was &gt;70% similar to natural areas in only 4 of 12 comparisons.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves the introduction of vegetation as blocks or large sods, containing multiple individual plants. This technique might be used to introduce particular species to an already vegetated site, or to speed up the revegetation of a currently bare site. Blocks may be cut from a focal site, kept to one side during a disturbance, then replaced. Alternatively, blocks may be sourced from a separate donor site. When moving blocks from a donor site, it may be necessary to excavate the recipient site to avoid raising the soil surface.\nCaution: This action inevitably causes damage to any donor site. Also, transplanted blocks could contain invasive plants, animals or microorganisms. A possible solution to these problems is to use soil from healthy marshes or swamps that are earmarked for destruction. Using local donor sites could minimize the spread of invasive species, and make use of communities adapted to local conditions.\nEffects of this action could be measured for the sods or vegetation overall (e.g. overall community composition of sods, or survival of sods) or for individual species or plants within the sods (e.g. height of the dominant grass species).\nRelated actions: Directly plant whole plants; Transplant or replace wetland soil."
