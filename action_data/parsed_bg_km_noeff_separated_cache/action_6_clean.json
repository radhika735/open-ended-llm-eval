  "action_title": "Increase the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence demonstrating the effects of restoring natural or semi-natural habitat on bee diversity or abundance in neighbouring farms.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral studies show that bee abundance and/or diversity on farms are higher when areas of natural or semi-natural habitat (including forest) are closer or the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in the surrounding landscape is higher (reviewed by Ricketts et al. 2008, for example). We know of no evidence demonstrating that the restoration of natural or semi-natural habitats affects bee diversity or abundance in neighbouring farms, although at least one such study is currently underway.\nReference:\nRicketts T.
