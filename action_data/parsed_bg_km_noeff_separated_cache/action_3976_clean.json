  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects of planting new hedges on butterflies and moths. Five studies were in the UK and one was in each of Ireland and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (5 studies): Three of four site comparison studies (including three replicated and three paired studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture. The other study found that hedgerows had a similar species richness of butterflies to grass banks between fields. One replicated study in the UK found that gorse, oak and blackthorn planted within hedgerows had more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than more commonly planted hawthorn.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, three paired, site comparison studies and two site comparison studies) in the UK, Ireland and Canada found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5–10 metres away from hedgerows.The other study found that the abundance of butterflies along hedgerows was similar to grass banks between fields without hedgerows.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the UK found that moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to be flying parallel to it than moths recorded further away.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHedgerows provide important semi-natural habitat within farmland, offering food and shelter in their own right, as well as connectivity between other patches of semi-natural habitat, such as woodland. Hedgerows also reduce the temperature fluctuations experienced in open farmland, which may facilitate greater species survival or movement through the landscape. The presence of hedgerows in an agricultural landscape has been found to increase both the abundance and species richness of butterflies recorded (Luppi et al. 2018), therefore planting new hedgerows may help butterfly and moth populations on farmland to recover.\nFor studies on managing existing hedgerows, see “Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (e.g. no spray, gap-filling and laying)”.\nLuppi M., Dondina O., Orioli V. & Bani L.
