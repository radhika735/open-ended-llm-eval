  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of using technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers to enable avoidance of unwanted catch on marine fish populations. The study was in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans.\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): A review in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans reported that where technology was used to provide near real-time catch information to fishers there were reductions of unwanted catch or discards in two of three cases.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFleet communication systems in commercial fisheries report near real-time observations of hotspots of unwanted species to enable a fishery to operate in a coordinated way to reduce the capture of those species across the fleet (Gilman et al. 2006). They utilise various forms of technology for effective communication; from email via satellite-based vessel monitoring systems and other satellite-based systems, to radio and phone. A combination of these technologies may also be used for communication between vessels and to transmit information to a designated hub. Using technology to communicate near real-time catch information may reduce the catches of protected species and other unwanted fish by facilitating avoidance across cooperating vessels.\nGilman E.L., Dalzell P. & Martin S.
