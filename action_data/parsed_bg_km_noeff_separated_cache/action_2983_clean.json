  "action_title": "Abandon aquaculture facilities: allow brackish/saline marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning aquaculture facilities with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. The study was in Costa Rica.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond contained the same four tree species as a nearby natural mangrove forest.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond contained a greater density of trees than a nearby natural mangrove forest.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One site comparison study in Costa Rica reported that after 14 years, an abandoned shrimp pond had a shorter tree canopy than a nearby natural mangrove forest.\nBasal area (1 study): The same study reported that the basal area of trees was smaller in an abandoned shrimp pond, after 14 years, than in a nearby natural mangrove forest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIt may be possible that marshes or swamps will recover on their own, without any active intervention, if human activities are stopped. Such passive recovery can be cheaper than active intervention and allow development of a community well adapted to local conditions. However, plant colonization may not occur at all or, if it does, occur slowly or be dominated by invasive species (Zahawi et al. 2014). Successful recovery may be hindered by physical degradation (e.g. a water table that is too low, restricted tidal exchange), chemical degradation (e.g. acidification of wetland soils when exposed to oxygen) or an insufficient supply of propagules.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have monitored marshes or swamps after the abandonment of aquaculture facilities within them (stock removed and maintenance completely stopped, with no additional intervention). Therefore, the summarized evidence is best considered as an indication of what kind of vegetation can develop after abandonment of aquacultural facilities, and how long it takes to develop, rather than a complete survey of all relevant evidence.\nRelated actions: Modify aquaculture practices in watershed, including abandonment of aquaculture facilities.\nZahawi R.A., Reid J.L. & Holl K.D.
