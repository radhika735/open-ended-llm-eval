  "action_title": "Use prescribed burning to control trees",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after trial in the USA found that burning to control trees did not change cover of two of three grass species.\nOne randomized, controlled study in Italy found that prescribed burning to control trees reduced cover of common heather, increased cover of purple moor grass, and had mixed effects on the basal area of trees.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the use of prescribed fire to control problematic tree species in shrublands. Fire may damage or kill trees therefore reducing competition between trees and shrubland vegetation. This may allow shrubland plants to increase in abundance."
