  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGathering of plants may involve removal of the whole plant (e.g. for sale as an ornamental species) or removal of plant parts, such as flowers or fruits. Gathering of certain species can be prohibited or limited by national legislation. In addition, international agreements such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) can be used to control the trade of certain species, potentially reducing the motivation for their harvest."
