  "action_title": "Remove or control non-native crayfish",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of removing or controlling non-native crayfish on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSignal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkia have been introduced to many parts of the world. Signal crayfish reproduce and grow fast and so can reach high densities. Non-native crayfish have direct effects on amphibians through predation of eggs but also affect aquatic communities by consuming aquatic plants and competing with and introducing disease to native crayfish.\nThere is additional literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling crayfish, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Aquiloni et al. 2009; Aquiloni & Gherardi 2010). For the success of control of Procambarus crayfish see the Control of Freshwater Invasive Species synopsis, or click on 'Closely related actions, See also...' to the right.\nAquiloni L., Becciolini A., Berti R., Porciani S., Trunfio C. & Gherardi F.
