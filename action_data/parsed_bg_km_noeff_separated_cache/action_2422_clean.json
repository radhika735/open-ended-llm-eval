  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using campaigns and public information to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats. One study was in the USA and one was in Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nHuman behaviour change (2 studies): A randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that displaying education signs did not reduce the percentage of garbage containers that were accessible to black bears. A controlled, before-and-after study in Lao People's Democratic Republic found that a social marketing campaign promoting a telephone hotline increased reporting of illegal hunting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals face a range of threats from humans. These may include exploitation through hunting or persecution if the mammal is perceived as a threat or a nuisance. In some cases, mammals are protected by regulations and laws but these may be difficult to enforce. Some infringements may be difficult to detect whilst, in other cases, people may be unaware of their responsibilities under such rules. Campaigns may be designed to increase compliance with laws, to encourage reporting of infringements, such as illegal hunting, or to reduce behaviours that can be a threat to mammals, such as consumption of products derived from wild mammals. These may use a variety of media and ranging from broadcasting and social media through to word of mouth."
