  "action_title": "Turn deck lights off during night-time setting of longlines to reduce bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single replicated and controlled study in the South Atlantic found significantly lower bycatch rates when deck lights were turned off during line setting at night.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBirds might be attracted to deck lights on fishing boats either to use them to forage, or because birds are generally attracted to lights at night (see ‘Threat: Pollution’ for interventions designed to reduce the threat of light pollution). In either case, birds may be vulnerable, so turning off the lights may reduce mortality."
