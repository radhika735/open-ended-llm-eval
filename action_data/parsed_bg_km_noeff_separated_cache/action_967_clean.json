  "action_title": "Deter bats from turbines using radar",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of deterring bats from wind turbines using radar on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIt has been suggested that bats may avoid the radio frequency radiation associated with radar installations. During experimental trials in the UK, bats were less active at wetland and woodland foraging sites when pulses of radar signals were emitted from antennas (Nicholls & Racey 2009). However, the authors state that the thermal effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation may be harmful to bats and other organisms.\nNicholls B. & Racey P.A. (2009) The aversive effect of electromagnetic radiation on foraging bats - a possible means of discouraging bats from approaching wind turbines. PLoS ONE, 4, e6246."
