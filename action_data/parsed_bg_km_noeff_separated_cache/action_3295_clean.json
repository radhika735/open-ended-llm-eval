  "action_title": "Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/saline wetlands before planting trees/shrubs. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on an estuarine mudflat in Australia found that ploughing the substrate before planting grey mangrove Avicennia marina propagules had no significant effect on their height after two growing seasons.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on an estuarine mudflat in Australia found that ploughing the substrate before planting grey mangrove propagules had no significant effect on their survival over two growing seasons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment (and any vegetation on it), without permanently removing any soil/sediment. Mechanical disturbance could be carried out by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying. It may improve survival or growth of planted vegetation. It can clear potentially competing vegetation, and loosen up the soil to allow roots to penetrate more easily.\nRelated actions: Remove surface soil/sediment before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting, including by deep ploughing."
