  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFourteen studies evaluated the effects of translocating snakes on their populations. Seven studies were in the USA, two were in Antigua, two were global and one was in each of Canada, South Korea and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): One of two global reviews reported that 15 of 47 reptile translocations (number of snake species not provided) resulted in stable or growing populations (both wild-caught and captive bred reptiles or snakes). The other review reported that the outcome of one indigo snake reintroduction was unknown. One replicated study in the USA found that five of 13 translocations of snakes resulted in established populations. Three studies in Canada and Antigua reported that 3–7 years after translocations of red-sided garter snakes and Antiguan racer snakes, greater numbers were counted.\nReproductive success (3 studies): One global review reported that breeding occurred in nine of 22 reptile translocations (of both wild-caught and captive bred animals). Two studies in Antigua reported successful reproduction in translocated populations of Antiguan racer snakes three years after release.\nSurvival (8 studies): Three controlled studies in the USA and Australia found that translocated timber rattlesnakes, northern water snakes and dugite snakes had lower survival than resident snakes, and in one study no translocated snakes survived a year. One controlled study in the USA found that ratsnakes held in captivity for 1–7 years before release had lower survival compared to snakes held for 7–18 days or resident snakes. Four studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Canada, the USA and South Korea reported that 12–45% of snakes survived for three months to eight years after release.\nCondition (1 study): One controlled study in the USA found that translocated northern water snakes had similar growth rates compared to resident snakes.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (5 studies): Three of five controlled studies in the USA found that differences in movement and home range size of translocated and resident hognose snakes, ratsnakes and dugite snakes were mixed. The other two studies found that translocated timber rattlesnakes and northern water snakes had larger home ranges than residents. One study also found that translocated timber rattlesnakes had higher daily movements than resident snakes.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.\nThis action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.\nThis action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.\nTranslocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara."
