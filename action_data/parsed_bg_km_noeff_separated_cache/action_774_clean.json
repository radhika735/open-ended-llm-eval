  "action_title": "Delay herbicide use",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: Two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark found more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed. One of the studies found some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefitted early in the season. Weeds: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found more weeds when herbicide treatments were delayed. Insect pests and damage: One of two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from Canada and Denmark found more insect pests, but only for some pest groups, and one study found fewer pests in one of two experiments and for one of two crop varieties. One study found lower crop damage in some but not all varieties and study years. Yield: One randomised, replicated, controlled study found lower yields and one study found no effect.\nCrops studied were beet and oilseed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDelaying herbicide application dates within a growing season may improve natural pest control as this encourages weeds to grow early in the season, providing habitat and resources to help natural enemy populations develop. These weeds may also divert generalist pests (those with broad habitat or resource requirements) that would otherwise reach the crop."
