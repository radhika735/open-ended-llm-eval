  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using larger hooks on reptile populations. One study was in the USA and one was in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One study in the USA of captive loggerhead turtles found that turtles were less likely to attempt to swallow larger circle hooks than smaller ones.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch (1 study): One replicated study in the Eastern Pacific Ocean found that olive ridley turtles were less likely to be caught by swallowing larger hooks than smaller ones.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarger hooks may be more difficult for sea turtles to swallow and so using larger hooks may reduce numbers of hooks being swallowed, which may reduce unwanted catch rates and increase the chances of turtles surviving after being caught and released.\nStudies in this action specifically test whether larger hooks are more or less likely to catch sea turtles than smaller hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to J-hooks, see Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.\nSee also: Use non-ringed hooks and Use non-offset hooks for studies that specifically test the effect of using these variations in hook design. See also Modify number of hooks between floats on longlines."
