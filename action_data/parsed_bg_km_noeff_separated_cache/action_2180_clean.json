  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of improving minimum sewage treatment standards on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Bay of Biscay (Spain).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Bay of Biscay found that after introducing a secondary treatment of sewage wastewaters, invertebrate community composition at an impacted site did not significantly change compared to unimpacted sites.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Bay of Biscay found that after introducing a secondary treatment of sewage wastewaters, invertebrate richness and diversity at an impacted site did not significantly change compared to unimpacted sites.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Bay of Biscay found that after introducing a secondary treatment of sewage wastewaters, total cover of invertebrates significantly increased at an impacted site at 8 m but not 3 m depth, compared to unimpacted sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUntreated sewage reaching the marine environment can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles, and through changes in salinity (McGann et al. 2003). Setting minimum sewage treatment standards, or improving the standards already in place, could potentially ensure that pollution level and associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates are minimized. For instance, improving standards can be achieved by installing a secondary treatment involving the mechanical and biological removal of settleable solids and dissolved organic compounds (Bustamante et al. 2012).\nEvidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of untreated sewage”, “Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of sewage sludge” and “Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow”.\n \nBustamante M., Bevilacqua S., Tajadura J., Terlizzi A. & Saiz-Salinas J.I.
