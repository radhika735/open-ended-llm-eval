  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of planting riparian buffer strips on reptile populations. The study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in the USA found that grassed riparian buffer strips were used by up to five snake species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRiparian buffer strips are uncultivated strips of permanent vegetation at the edge of waterways. They may be used within agricultural, forestry and urban systems to help reduce bank erosion and prevent pollutants and sediment entering the waterway. These buffer strips can therefore help to protect aquatic and semi-aquatic species.\nFor other studies that investigated retaining riparian buffers see Threat: Biological resource use – Logging and wood harvesting – Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest and Habitat protection – Retain buffer zones around core habitat."
