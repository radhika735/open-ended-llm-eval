  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from the UK appeared to show increases in local populations of owls following the installation of artificial nests, although the authors from one note that they could not rule out birds merely switching from natural nest sites. Another UK study found that providing nesting sites when renovating buildings maintained barn owl Tyto alba populations, whilst they declined at sites without nests.\nFour studies from the USA and the UK found high levels of breeding success in artificial nests, three finding equal or higher productivity than natural nests. A replicated, controlled study from the USA found lower productivity from artificial nests, whilst a replicated, controlled study from Finland found that artificial nests were only successful in the absence of larger owls and a replicated, controlled study from Hungary found that fledglings from artificial nests were less likely to be found alive after one year.\nFour studies from the USA and Europe found that artificial nests were used at least as frequently as natural nesting sites. Five studies from across the world found that owls used artificial nests, with one finding that use increased over time, although only for one of two species.\nThree studies found that owls differentiated between nests in different positions, whilst five studies found that different designs of nests differed in occupancy or productivity. Three studies found occupancy did not differ between designs and two found no differences in productivity for different designs.",
