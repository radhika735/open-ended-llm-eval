  "action_title": "Use soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Portugal and the USA found that ploughing increased the cover and diversity of understory plants.\nTwo of three studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled) in Canada and Brazil found that ploughing increased,  and one found it decreased the density of young trees. Two replicated, controlled studies in Ethiopia and Sweden found mixed effects of tilling on different tree species.\nOne replicated, before-and-after trial in Finland found that ploughing decreased the cover of plants living on wood surface.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA found that ploughing did not decrease the spreading distance and density of invasive grass seedlings.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDifferent soil disturbance treatments are often used to improve degraded soils, mainly before restoration planting. Mechanically scratching or ploughing are the most common techniques. These actions may have mixed effects on different plant groups and may have a significant effect on biodiversity and forest structure.\nOther studies on the effects of soil disturbance are discussed in - ‘Use vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance to the soil’ and in ‘Use soil disturbance to enhance germination (excluding soil scarification or ploughing)’."
