  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of creating or retaining deadwood in forest management. This study was in Sweden.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden found that sites where deadwood had been left for many years had a higher abundance of Scardia boletella moths than conventionally managed sites in one of two regions, but the occurrence of Archinemapogon yildizae moths was similar across all sites.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn conventionally managed forests deadwood is often cleared out, either to use, or for safety, accessibility or aesthetic reasons. Although most butterflies and moths will not use deadwood directly, woodlands managed in a more natural way, with deadwood retained or added, may support a more diverse ecosystem. For example, the presence of deadwood should encourage a greater abundance and diversity of fungi, on which some species of moth depend (Bury et al. 2014).\nBury J., Hołowiński M., Jaworski T., Mleczak M., Zajda W. & Zamorski R.
