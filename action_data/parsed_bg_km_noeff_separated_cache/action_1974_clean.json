  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of informing local communities about disease risks from hunting and eating bat meat to reduce killing of bats on bat populations. The study was in Ghana.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)         \n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in Ghana found that fewer hunters intended to hunt bats in future after they were provided with education about the risks of diseases carried by bats.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInfectious diseases can be transmitted through the handling, preparation, and consumption of bats. However, hunters and vendors are often unaware of these risks (Harrison et al. 2011). Informing local communities about disease risks may discourage people from hunting and eating bats. However, this would need to be implemented with caution as it may also encourage negative attitudes and increase the intentional killing of bats to reduce the risk of exposure. See also ‘Inform local communities about the negative impacts of bat hunting to reduce killing of bats’.\nHarrison M.E., Cheyne S.M., Darma F., Ribowo D.A., Limin S.H. & Struebig M.J.
