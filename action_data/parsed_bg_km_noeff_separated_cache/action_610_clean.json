  "action_title": "Artificially incubate and hand-rear bustards in captivity",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA review of a houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii captive breeding programme in Saudi Arabia found that there was no difference in survival between artificially and parentally incubated eggs. \nA second review of the same programme found that removing eggs from clutches as they were laid increased the number laid by females.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial incubation involves removing eggs from incubating parents and using an incubator to hatch them. Techniques can be extremely complex, with precision humidity and temperature control and turning of the eggs to ensure correct development Hand-rearing can be used with chicks from artificially-incubated eggs or with chicks removed from parents after hatching and involves manually feeding chicks until independence. Both techniques can be used to encourage parents to produce more offspring, or when naturally-raised chicks and eggs have low survival."
