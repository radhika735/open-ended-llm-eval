  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of increasing the number of species in a seed mix on grassland vegetation. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Germany.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (4 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix did not change plant species richness.\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix, along with sowing seeds from a local source, increased the species richness of target plants.\nSown/planted species richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA (one of which was randomized) found that increasing the number species in a seed mix increased the species richness of sown plants.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Germany found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix, along with sowing seeds from a local source, increased the cover of target plant species.\nSown/planted species abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (one of which was randomized) in the USA found that increasing the number of species in a seed mix increased the cover of sown plant species. The other study found that there was no change in the cover of sown species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGrassland restoration often aims to restore species rich habitats. One method for potentially increasing species richness of restoration sites is to increase the number of species whose seeds are sown."
