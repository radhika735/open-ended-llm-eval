  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using drugs to treat parasites. Three studies were in the USA, two were in Spain, one was in Germany and one was in Croatia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study the USA found that medical treatment of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep against lungworm did not increase lamb survival.\nCondition (6 studies): Three of four before-and-after studies (one controlled), in Germany, the USA and Croatia, found that after administering drugs to mammals, parasite burdens were reduced in roe deer and in wild boar piglets and numbers of white-tailed deer infected were reduced. A third study found that levels of lungworm larvae in bighorn sheep faeces were reduced one month after drug treatment but not after three to seven months. One of these studies also found that the drug treatment resulted in increased body weight in roe deer fawns. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that higher doses of ivermectin treated sarcoptic mange in Spanish ibex faster than lower doses, and treatment was more effective in animals with less severe infections. A replicated, before-and-after study in Spain found that after injecting Spanish ibex with ivermectin to treat sarcoptic mange a mange-free herd was established.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHigh levels of parasites in wild mammals may reduce fitness and lead to higher levels of mortality (e.g. Cooper et al. 2012). Drugs are readily available to reduce infestation levels of a wide range of parasites, though they are more frequently used to treat domestic animals. Attempts to treat wild mammals are most likely to be made where there is specific economic value to the wild mammal, such as among species that are valued for sporting purposes. In such cases, drug treatments may be administered through adding to baits or supplementary food left for animals.\nCooper N., Kamilar J.M. & Nunn C.L. (2012) Host longevity and parasite species richness in mammals. PLoS ONE, 7, e42190."
