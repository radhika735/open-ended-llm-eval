  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of repurposing obsolete offshore structures on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was of a sunken oil rig in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall species richness/diversity (1 study): One study in the Mediterranean Sea recorded at least 53 invertebrate species having colonised a sunken oil rig after 30 years. Species included 14 species of molluscs, 14 species of worms, and 11 species of crustaceans.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOffshore structures (such as oil rigs and windfarm turbine bases), have been shown to support diverse invertebrate assemblages, and act as artificial reefs (Coates et al. 2014; Krone et al. 2017; Langhamer & Wilhelmsson 2009). For instance, wind turbine foundations in a windfarm in the German Bight, North Sea, were found to host over 5,000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus per foundation (Krone et al. 2017).\nFollowing decommissioning, entire or parts of obsolete offshore structures can potentially be repurposed to act as artificial reefs instead of being removed from the marine environment (Frumkes 2002). By repurposing obsolete offshore structures within the marine environment and leaving them in place or placing them in strategic locations, they can potentially provide additional hard surface for subtidal benthic invertebrates to colonise and seek shelter, and thereby enhance local invertebrate biodiversity (Frumkes 2002; Ponti et al. 2002). This can also benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates by avoiding or reducing the disturbance associated with the removal of these structures from the marine environment.\nEvidence for interventions relating to the decommissioning of offshore structures is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Leave pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning” and “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Leave utility and service lines in place after decommissioning”. Evidence related to artificial reefs is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Habitat enhancement” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Artificial habitat creation”.\n \nCoates D.A., Deschutter Y., Vincx M. & Vanaverbeke J.
