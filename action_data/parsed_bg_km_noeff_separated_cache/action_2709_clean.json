  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of modifying the design or arrangement of tickler chains in a bottom trawl on marine fish populations. One was in the North Sea (Netherlands/UK) and one was in the Atlantic Ocean (Scotland). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean found that removing the tickler chain from a trawl reduced catches of non-commercial target skates/rays and sharks, and individuals were larger, compared to trawling with the chain. The study also found that catches of commercial target species were typically unaffected. The other study found that two modified tickler chain arrangements did not reduce discarded fish catch compared to a standard arrangement.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawl nets are towed through the water by fishing vessels. Some types of bottom trawl, particularly beam trawls, are rigged with ‘tickler’ chains or a chain mat, that spread from one side of the trawl mouth to the other, contacting the seabed. Tickler chains and chain mats physically disturb the seabed to increase the likelihood of animals entering the mouth of the trawl. However, they often cause unwanted species to enter the trawl as well as those targeted commercially. Modifying tickler chain arrangement (such as reducing the size of chain links, or attaching only one end of the chain to the beam; Bergman & Van Santbrink 2000; Broadhurst et al. 2015), or even removing them altogether, may reduce the seabed disturbance and therefore result in fewer unwanted fish species/sizes being retained by the gear.\nFor related interventions describing other modifications to the overall design of different types or parts of trawl gear is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)’, ‘Change the size of the main body of a trawl net’, ‘Decrease the circumference or diameter of the codend of a trawl net’, ‘Modify the design or configuration of trawl doors’ and ‘Modify a bottom trawl to raise parts of the gear off the seabed during fishing’.\nBergman M.J.N. & Van Santbrink J.W.
