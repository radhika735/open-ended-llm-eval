  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of grazing with mixed livestock. All three studies were in the UK and compared grazing with sheep and cattle to sheep only.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had fewer moth species than plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies and one paired, site comparison study) in the UK found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had a similar abundance of moth caterpillars and small invertebrates including caterpillars to plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only. One of these studies found that in plots grazed at high intensity, the abundance of small invertebrates including caterpillars was lower in plots with sheep and cattle than in sheep only plots. The other study found that grassland plots grazed at low intensity with sheep and cattle had a lower abundance of adult moths than plots grazed at low intensity with sheep only.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLivestock prefer to eat different plants, and graze at different heights or in different patterns. For example, sheep graze to a uniform height, while cattle leave heavily trampled areas and eat grass in clumps, leaving patches of taller vegetation (Schultz et al. 2008). These grazing patterns encourage different vegetation communities to develop, with different plants dominating. Therefore, grazing with a mix of livestock, rather than just one type, may encourage a more diverse community of butterflies and moths, with individual species preferring the patches created by particular grazers.\nThis action includes studies comparing the use of multiple livestock types with single types of livestock. For studies comparing the use of different single types of livestock, see “Change type of livestock grazing”.\nSchultz C.B., Russell C. & Wynn L.
