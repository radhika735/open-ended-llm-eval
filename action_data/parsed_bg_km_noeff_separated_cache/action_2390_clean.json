  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of using repellent on slug pellets to reduce non-target poisoning. This study was in the UK.\n\nKEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the UK found that, at some concentrations, food treated with a bitter substance was consumed less by wood mice but not by bank voles or common shrews.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPoisons used to control slugs may also be ingested by non-target species, such as rodents. Such poisoning can lead to declines in rodent numbers (Shore et al. 1997). Substances that make slug pellets unattractive to small mammals, yet still effective on slugs, may help to reduce small mammal losses\n \nShore R.F., Feber R.E., Firbank L.G., Fishwick S.K., Macdonald D.W. & Nøruma, U.
