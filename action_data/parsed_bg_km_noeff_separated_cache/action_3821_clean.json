  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of implementing vessel decommissioning schemes on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDecommissioning of a fishing vessel is the permanent withdrawal (often by scrapping) of that vessel from operation within the fishing industry. Decommissioning schemes usually involve the payment of a grant to the owner of the vessel to encourage uptake in the scheme and to compensate for the loss of the vessel. The aim of decommissioning schemes is to reduce fishing effort by reducing the size of a fleet that operates in an area or is commercially targeting a species of conservation concern. Reduced fishing effort may lead to reduced fish mortality and hence allow depleted populations to recover from the effects of overfishing. However, the effectiveness of decommissioning schemes may depend on their success at specifically targeting areas where they would have most impact. i.e., successful removal of vessels exhibiting the highest degree of fishing effort (Anon. 2006).\nAnon.
