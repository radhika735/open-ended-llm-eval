  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA randomised, replicated and controlled study from the USA found higher fledging success from white-eyed vireo Vireo griseus nests protected from ants with a physical barrier and a chemical repellent, compared to control nests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral ant species including the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala and yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes have been introduced across the world and have often become invasive. Whilst too small to damage most adult birds, they can have severe impacts on chicks. Due to their huge numbers and adaptability eradication is rarely an option (although see ‘Control invasive ants on islands’). Therefore preventing them from accessing nests may be the best intervention."
