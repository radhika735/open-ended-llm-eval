  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of installing cave gates on bat populations. Six studies were in the USA and five studies were in Europe.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (7 studies): Three of four before-and-after studies (including one replicated study and one controlled study) in the Netherlands, the USA, Spain and Turkey found more or similar numbers of bats in caves and a bunker after gates were installed to restrict public access. The other study found fewer bats in caves after gates were installed. Two before-and-after studies in the USA and Spain found more bats within two caves after the size of the gated entrances were increased. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that installing cave gates resulted in population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in the population growth rates of bats roosting in caves with and without cave gates.\nCondition (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA found that bats hibernating in a cave with a wall and gate over the entrance lost more body mass than bats in a nearby unmodified cave.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)   \n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Spain found no difference in the occupancy rates of bats roosting in caves with and without cave gates.\nBehaviour change (4 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after and site comparison study in the USA found that bats at cave entrances circled more and entered caves less after gates were installed. One replicated study in the USA found that bats flew through gates with a funnel design more frequently than gates with a round bar or angle iron design. One randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that fewer bats flew through cave gates when the spacing between horizontal bars was reduced. One before-and-after study in the USA found that significantly fewer bats emerged from a cave with a gate installed compared with a cave with a fence.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRecreational users of caves can disturb both nursing and hibernating colonies of bats causing abandonment of young or arousal from hibernation. Gates have been installed at cave entrances to restrict public access and reduce human disturbance. However, cave gating can also impede access by bats and early installation attempts from the 1950s to the 1970s often resulted in roost abandonment (Tuttle 1977). For evidence relating to gates at mines, see ‘Install and maintain gates at mine entrances to restrict public access’.\nTuttle M.D. (1977) Gating as a means of protecting cave dwelling bats. Pages 77–82 in: T. Aley & D. Rhodes (eds.) 1976 National Cave Management Symposium Proceedings, Speleobooks, Albuquerque, USA."
