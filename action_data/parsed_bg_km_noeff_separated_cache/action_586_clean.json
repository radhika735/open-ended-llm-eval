  "action_title": "Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies found that birds bred in areas where decoys (of birds or nests) were used to attract birds. Six of the studies used several interventions at once. Two studies from the USA found that least terns Sterna antillarum and herons were not attracted to new areas to breed when decoys were used.\nFive studies from North America and France and Spain found that more birds landed near decoys than in control areas. \nThe two studies to compare decoy types found that three-dimensional models were better than two-dimensional ‘cut-outs’ and plastic models of birds were better than rag decoys.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs well as physically moving birds to safe areas (translocations, see separate intervention), it is possible to try and get birds to move of their own accord. Many birds nest colonially for protection and are attracted nesting areas with conspecifics. Using realistic decoys may therefore encourage birds to colonise new areas. A similar intervention is ‘Use vocalisations to attract birds to safe areas’."
