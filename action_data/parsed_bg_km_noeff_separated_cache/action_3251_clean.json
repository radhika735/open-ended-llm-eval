  "action_title": "Add cover other than mulch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using cover other than mulch to restore/create marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCovers (such as plastic sheets, fleece or fibre mats) can be placed on a wetland surface to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of wetland vegetation. The precise effect of a cover may depend on the material and its height above the wetland.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have added covers without adding vegetation. The cover should be used to help or manage existing vegetation, such as remnant patches of vegetation, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already present.\nRelated actions: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Add surface mulch (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Add cover other than mulch to complement planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs)."
