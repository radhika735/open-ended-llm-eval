  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining dead trees after uprooting. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USAÂ found that areas where trees were uprooted but left on site were used more by desert cottontails than were cleared areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nManagement or restoration of some habitats involves removing trees. This may occur, for example, in sites where fire suppression has caused woodland to become denser than it has been historically. Retaining uprooted trees can increase structural diversity at ground level. This may in turn increase cover available to some mammal species."
