  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing and enforcing legislation to prevent intentional killing of mammals at aquaculture systems.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine and freshwater mammals may be intentionally killed (e.g. by shooting or poisoning) at aquaculture systems in attempts to reduce mammal predation on fish stocks and damage to gear. Although routine killing has been made illegal in many countries, permits or licences may be issued to allow a limited number of ‘problem’ individuals to be killed. Enforcement may be necessary to prevent illegal killing.\nFor a similar intervention, see Introduce and enforce legislation to prevent intentional killing of mammals at wild fisheries."
