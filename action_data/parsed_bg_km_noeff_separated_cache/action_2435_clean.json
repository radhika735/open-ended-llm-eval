  "action_title": "Use loud noises to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of using loud noises to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Mexico.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including two controlled studies), in the USA and Mexico, found that loud noises at least temporarily deterred sheep predation or food consumption by coyotes and (combined with visual deterrents) deterred livestock predation by large predators.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention specifically refers to use of sound, from various sources, to deter predation on livestock by wild mammalian carnivores. If successful, such an intervention could reduce livestock losses and, thus, reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of predators."
