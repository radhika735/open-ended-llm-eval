  "action_id": "475",
  "action_title": "Use artificial visual and auditory stimuli to induce breeding in wild populations",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single small study from the British Virgin Islands found that there was an increase in breeding behaviour in a small population of Caribbean flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber following the introduction of visual and auditory stimulants.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome species that nest in colonies may require a ‘critical mass’ of individuals to be present before breeding behaviour is stimulated. If this is the case, it might be possible to help very small populations (beneath this threshold) to breed by using decoys and vocalisations to stimulate courtship behaviours."
