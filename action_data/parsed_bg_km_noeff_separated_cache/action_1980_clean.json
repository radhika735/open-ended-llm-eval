  "action_id": "1980",
  "action_title": "Restrict the collection of bat specimens for research",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of restricting the collection of bat specimens for research on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBoth ethical and conservation concerns have been raised over the unnecessary collection of bat specimens for research (e.g. Russo et al. 2017). It has been suggested that there should be stricter regulation and the use of alternatives, such as collecting tissue or fur samples for molecular analysis, should be encouraged.\nRusso D., Ancillotto L., Hughes A.C., Galimberti A. & Mori E. (2017) Collection of voucher specimens for bat research: conservation, ethical implications, reduction, and alternatives. Mammal Review, 47, 237–246."
