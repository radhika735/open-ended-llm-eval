  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding upland topsoil to freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Canada. One study was in a greenhouse.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater trenches in Canada found that adding a mixture of mineral soil and peat to pots of mine tailings before planting water sedge Carex aquatilis typically increased its above-ground biomass two growing seasons later.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nIndividual plant size (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that mixing topsoil into pots of mineral soil/compost before planting tussock sedge Carex stricta seedlings typically increased the biomass and number of shoots they developed over three months. However, one replicated, paired, controlled study in a wet meadow restoration site in the USA reported that mixing topsoil into the mineral soil/compost substrate before planting tussock sedge seedlings had no clear effect on the number of shoots they developed over two months.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater trenches in Canada found that adding a mixture of mineral soil and peat to pots of mine tailings either increased or had no significant effect on survival of planted water sedge Carex aquatilis over two growing seasons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTopsoil can be a source of soil organic matter and help to improve water retention (Bruland & Richardson 2004). This might benefit wetland vegetation, particularly when creating new marshes. Topsoil may often be added to complement planting (current intervention) rather than without planting: upland soil will probably not contain seeds or fragments of marsh plants. Caution: Topsoil may contain seeds or fragments of undesirable vegetation.\nRelated actions: Add upland topsoil, other than to complement planting; Transplant wetland soil before/after planting.\nBruland G.L. & Richardson C.J.
