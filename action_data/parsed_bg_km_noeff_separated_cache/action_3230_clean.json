  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding sediment to existing freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA reported that adding sediment to freshwater marshes typically reduced plant species richness after one growing season.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that adding sediment to freshwater marshes had no significant effect on total live vegetation biomass after one growing season.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that adding sediment to freshwater marshes had no significant effect on the biomass of most of the dominant herbaceous species after one growing season.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding small amounts of sediment to marshes is a possible action to counter multiple threats. These include: sea level rise; subsidence (e.g. following oil and gas extraction); reduced sediment inputs following the construction of levees, flood control structures or jetties; and erosion from storms or boat traffic or following excessive grazing (Reed & Wilson 2004). Adding sediment can physically raise the ground surface and provide nutrients to vegetation. In turn, vegetation can physically protect and stabilize wetlands, and encourage further sediment deposition. Sediment or sediment slurry could be added directly to a focal site, or placed nearby then transported to the focal site by natural process (Foster 2013).\nFactors that might influence the effects of this action include the amount of sediment added, and whether any vegetation is present before sediment addition.\nRelated actions: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure; Transplant or replace wetland soil in order to introduce marsh vegetation.\nFoster N.M., Hudson M.D., Bray S. & Nicholls R.J.
