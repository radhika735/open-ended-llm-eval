  "action_id": "3951",
  "action_title": "Create scrapes and pools",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of creating scrapes and pools.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAccess to water or damp environments is important for some species of butterfly and moth, including those where the adults gather nutrients by “mud-puddling”, or where caterpillars depend on hostplants which grow in damp conditions (Thomas & Lewington 2016). Creating small areas of temporary or permanent water, such as scrapes and pools, may benefit these species.\nFor studies on the creation of large, permanent wetlands, see “Restore or create wetlands and floodplains”. For studies on managing waterbodies to prevent desiccation, see “Climate change and severe weather – Manage natural waterbodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation”.\nThomas J.A. & Lewington R.
