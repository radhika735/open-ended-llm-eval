  "action_title": "Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by mammalian predators",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study from the USA and three  ex situ experiments found evidence for lower consumption of eggs treated with repellent chemicals.\nHowever, when untreated eggs were provided simultaneously with or after treated eggs, no studies found evidence for continued lower predation. I.e. aversive conditioning did not occur. In addition, a study from the USA found no effect of repellent chemicals on predation rates of genuine nests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf predators can be taught to associate unpleasant tastes with eggs and/or chicks, then they may stop predating them. This can be achieved either through treating eggs in nests (spraying eggs or the nest) or placing artificial nests in the environment with eggs injected with unpleasant chemicals (not possible with natural nests as it will kill eggs).\nThe effectiveness scores shown here are based on an assessment of this evidence combined with the evidence from Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by avian predators; therefore the assessment describes the evidence available for Using aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation."
