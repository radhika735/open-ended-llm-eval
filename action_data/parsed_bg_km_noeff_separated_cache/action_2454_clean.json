  "action_title": "Use fencing/netting to reduce predation of fish stock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using fencing or netting to reduce predation of fish stock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFish farms can attract a range of mammalian predators, causing human-wildlife conflict. For example, questionnaire respondents from among fish farm operators and anglers in the Czech Republic reported between 7% and 17% of fish losses being due to predation by Eurasian otters Lutra lutra (Václavíková et al. 2011). If barriers, such as netting or fencing, can keep predators from accessing fish, this may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.\n \nVáclavíková M., Václavík T & Kostkan V. (2011) Otters vs. fishermen: Stakeholders’ perceptions of otter predation and damage compensation in the Czech Republic. Journal for Nature Conservation, 19, 95–102."
