  "action_id": "2278",
  "action_title": "Cease or prohibit the harvest of conch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of ceasing or prohibiting the harvest of conch on their populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConch populations have significantly declined due to overharvest, for commercial and recreational purposes (Theile 2001). Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvest of conch in an area, in order to reduce the pressure on conch populations and in theory allow the population to recovery naturally.\nWhen this intervention occurs in a marine protected area, the evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit harvest of conch”.\n \nTheile S. (2001) Queen conch fisheries and their management in the Caribbean. Brussels: TRAFFIC Europe."
