  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of creating tree plantations on agricultural land on bat populations. The three studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in Australia found no difference in the number of bat species in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies in Australia found no difference in bat activity (relative abundance) in agricultural areas with and without plantations of native trees. The other study found higher bat activity in plantations next to remnant native vegetation than in isolated plantations or over grazing land. In all three studies, bat activity was lower in plantations compared to original forest and woodland remnants.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCreating tree plantations on agricultural land may replace lost roosting and foraging habitat for bats. For evidence relating to planting single or scattered trees, see ‘Plant in-field trees’. For an intervention relating to planting trees to shade crops as part of agroforestry farming systems, see ‘Retain or plant native trees and shrubs amongst crops (agroforestry)’. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’."
