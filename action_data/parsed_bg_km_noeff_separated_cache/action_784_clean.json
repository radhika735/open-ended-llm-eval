  "action_title": "Use humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies (including one replicated study) in Italy and the UK found that despite assisting toads across roads during breeding migrations, 64–70% of populations declined over 6–10 years.\nOne study in the UK  found that despite assisting toads across roads during breeding migrations, at 7% of sites over 500 toads were still killed on roads.\nFive studies in Germany, the UK and Italy found that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols. Numbers ranged from 7,532 toads moved before and after breeding to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually. In the UK, there were over 400 patrols and 71 patrols spent an average of 90 person-hours moving toads and had been active for up to 10 years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany amphibians are killed by vehicles, particularly where their annual migration routes between breeding and over-wintering habitats cross roads. In some areas local volunteers may try to reduce deaths by collecting animals and releasing them on the other side of the road. Temporary drift-fencing and pitfall traps are often used to capture amphibians so that they can be assisted across the road. Patrols often focus on migrations to breeding sites rather than migrations of adults and juveniles away from those sites.\nIdeally evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention would consist of survival rates, counts of animals in the population or numbers killed on the road before and after or at sites with and without human assistance. However, such evidence is rarely available and so here we not only present data on population trends, but also numbers of animals that were moved across roads and numbers and effort of patrols assisting amphibians.\nFor other interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage amphibian populations or habitats see ‘Education and awareness raising – Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information’ and ‘Engage landowners and volunteers to manage land for amphibians’."
