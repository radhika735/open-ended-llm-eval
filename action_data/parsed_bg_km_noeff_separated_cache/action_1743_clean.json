  "action_id": "1743",
  "action_title": "Reduce frequency of harvest (of wild biological resources)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of reducing harvest frequency (of wild biological resources).\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHarvesting peatland vegetation less often (e.g. every two years instead of every year) will allow longer for the vegetation to recover from the disturbance, potentially growing taller and more densely. It might allow plants to mature and reproduce. Caution: In some fens and fen meadows, regular harvesting is important to maintain the diversity of desirable peatland species (Middleton et al. 2006).\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: reduce intensity of harvest; restrict vehicle use on peatlands; allow sustainable use of peatlands.\nMiddleton B., Holsten B. & van Diggelen R. (2006) Biodiversity management of fens and fen meadows by grazing, cutting and burning. Applied Vegetation Science, 9, 307–316."
