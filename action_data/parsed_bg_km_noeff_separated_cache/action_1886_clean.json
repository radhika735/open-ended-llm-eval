  "action_title": "Amphibians: Supplement diets with vitamins/ calcium applied to food (e.g. dusting prey)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of supplementing diets with vitamins/ calcium applied to food (e.g. dusting prey).\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn captivity, amphibian diets are often dramatically simplified, and prey species are often those that can be bred cheaply and efficiently in captivity. By dusting prey with vitamins or nutrients, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided.\nIn captivity, metabolic bone disease can be an issue in amphibians. It develops as a result of an imbalance of vitamin D3, phosphorous and calcium. Amphibians cannot process calcium without vitamin D, which is activated by ultraviolet light. Health problems may affect reproduction in captive animals."
