  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the frequency of cutting/mowing in freshwater marshes (or cutting/mowing them at different frequencies). There was one study in each of USA, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study of farmland ditches in the Netherlands found that marshy areas cut once, twice or three times/year had a similar overall plant community composition, when surveyed in July.\nOverall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in farmland ditches in the Netherlands and wet grasslands in Belgium reported that overall plant species richness was similar in plots cut once or twice/year (and three times/year in the Netherlands).\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of cutting twice/year (in July and October) on total above-ground biomass was intermediate between the effects of cutting once/year in July or October.\nIndividual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that cattail Typha spp. biomass was greater, nine months after the last cut, in plots cut every six weeks than in plots cut every three weeks. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in reedbeds in Italy found that common reed Phragmites australis biomass was similar in plots mown once or twice/year, when measured at least five months after the last cut.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the effects of different cutting/mowing frequencies, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve the target vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared cutting/mowing at different frequencies (e.g. 1 vs 2 cuts/year) but with the same intensity and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). For this action, “reduction” includes stopping disturbance altogether. However, studies comparing areas that remain uncut to areas that become cut, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.\nConnell, J.H.
