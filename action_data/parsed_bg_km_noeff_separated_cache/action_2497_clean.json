  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTen studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using fencing to exclude predators or other problematic species. Four studies were in Australia, four were in the USA and two were in Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A site comparison study in Australia found that fencing which excluded feral cats, foxes and rabbits increased small mammal species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (4 studies): Two of three studies (including two replicated, controlled studies), in Spain, Australia and the USA, found that abundances of European rabbits and small mammals were higher within areas fenced to exclude predators or other problematic species, compared to in unfenced areas. The third study found that hispid cotton rat abundance was not higher with predator fencing. A replicated, controlled study in Spain found that translocated European rabbit abundance was higher in fenced areas that excluded both terrestrial carnivores and raptors than in areas only accessible to raptors.\nReproductive success (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in USA found that predator exclosures increased the number of white-tailed deer fawns relative to the number of adult females.\nSurvival (7 studies): Four of six studies (including four replicated, controlled studies) in Spain, Australia and the USA, found that fencing to exclude predators did not increase survival of translocated European rabbits, hispid cotton rats, southern flying squirrels or western barred bandicoots. The other two studies found that persistence of populations of eastern barred bandicoots and long-haired rats was greater inside than outside fences. A controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that electric fencing reduced coyote incursions into sites frequented by black-footed ferrets.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredators can drive declines or local extinctions of vulnerable mammal species. Non-native predators may be a particular problem for native mammals that lack sufficient predator avoidance behaviours (e.g. Jones et al. 2004). Native predators can also threaten populations of mammals that persist in low numbers. Predator control may be impractical to sustain on a sufficient scale or may attract opposition on animal welfare grounds. Fencing, including electric fencing, may be a viable or more effective alternative in some situations.\nSee also Species Management – Release translocated mammals into fenced areas and Release captive-bred mammals into fenced areas.\nJones M.E., Smith G.C. & Jones S.M. (2004) Is anti-predator behaviour in Tasmanian eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) effective against introduced predators? Animal Conservation, 7, 155–160."
