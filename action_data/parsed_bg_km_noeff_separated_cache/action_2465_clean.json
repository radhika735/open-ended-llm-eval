  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of using tranquilizers to reduce stress during translocation. This study was in France.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled study in France found that using tranquilizers to reduce stress during translocation did not increase post-release survival of European rabbits.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocation of mammals can cause elevated stress levels. This may affect post-release survival (e.g. Beringer et al. 2002). Tranquilizers may be administered during the translocation process in order to reduce stress to captured mammals.\nBeringer J., Hansen L.P., Demand J.A., Sartwell J., Wallendorf M. & Mange R.
