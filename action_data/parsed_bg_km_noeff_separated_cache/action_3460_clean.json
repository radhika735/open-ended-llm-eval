  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. The study was in a port in the Netherlands.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that creating long flexible habitats on intertidal artificial structures altered the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. The flexible habitats themselves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrates that were absent from structure surfaces without flexible habitats.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Long flexible habitats’ are flexible protruding materials such as rope, ribbon or twine &gt;50 mm in length (modified from “Soft structures” in Strain et al. 2018).\nLong flexible habitats, such as macroalgal canopies and soft-bodied invertebrates, provide other organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Moore et al. 2007). They also provide shelter from predation (Dumas & Witman 1993). The size, density and material properties of flexible habitats are likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them and the spaces they create. \nSome organisms that form flexible habitats tend to be absent or sparse on intertidal artificial structures (Firth et al. 2016), although some readily colonize in wave-sheltered conditions (Jonsson et al. 2006). Artificial flexible habitats such as ropes or nets can be present on some structures, but are likely to be temporary and regularly disturbed (e.g. removed and replaced) when present. Long flexible habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively. In addition to potential biodiversity benefits, flexible habitats may offer some bioprotection for the underlying substrate, with potential to reduce weathering and enhance the durability of engineering materials (Coombes et al. 2013). Material choice is important for creating flexible habitats, since some flexible materials are unlikely to persist in the marine environment, while those that do may become entanglement hazards or contribute to pollution if dislodged. Studies that investigate the effects of transplanting live soft-bodied organisms onto structures are not included here, but are considered under the action “Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures”.\nSee also: Create short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures.\nCoombes M.A., Naylor L.A., Viles H.A. & Thompson R.C.
