  "action_title": "Provide shelter structures after fire",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing shelter structures after fire.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFire is an integral part of the dynamics of some ecosystems. It can clear out woody material, creating ideal conditions for new growth or herbaceous plants and small trees that are utilized by mammalian grazers and browsers. However, fire can also be disruptive to species, by removing cover. It may make them more vulnerable to effects of extreme weather and to predation and can cause them to seek out remaining vegetated areas that provide some degree of shelter (e.g. Pereoglou et al. 2011). For rare or otherwise valued species, shelters, such as low boards with space underneath, might be distributed across the burn area to help mitigate these effects.\nPereoglou F., Macgregor C., Banks S.C., Ford F., Wood J. & Lindenmayer D.B.
