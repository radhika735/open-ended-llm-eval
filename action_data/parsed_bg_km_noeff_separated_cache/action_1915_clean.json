  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour replicated, before-and-after studies in the USA, UK and Germany and one before-and-after study of a black bear, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves and Malayan sun bears found that hiding food increased exploring and foraging behaviours.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study and one before-and-after study in the USA found a decrease in stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bear.\nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that hiding food reduced the time Canadian lynx spent sleeping during the day.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the wild, many felids, canids and ursids have to forage for food which may be hidden or difficult to access. In captivity, food may be presented to the animal directly without any need for active searching. Enrichment, including hiding food, is aimed at promoting natural foraging behaviours and decreasing abnormal behaviours."
