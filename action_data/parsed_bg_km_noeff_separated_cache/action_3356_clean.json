  "action_title": "Prune roots of non-woody plants before planting: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of brackish/saline wetlands – of pruning their roots before planting.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlants can be stressed by the process of planting into a new site. Pruning before planting can encourage the growth of new, nutrient-assimilating feeder roots close to the plant: within the zone of roots that will be moved with the plant (Swackhamer & Sellmer 2007). It can also make planting process quicker and easier (Allen & Kennedy 1989).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of pruned and unpruned plants. Studies that simply report the performance of pruned plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nAllen J.A. & Kennedy H.E.
