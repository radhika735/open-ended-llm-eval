  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOut of 10 studies, six before-and-after studies from North America, Australia and Europe found that controlling avian predators led to increased population sizes, reduced mortality or increased reproductive success in seabirds on islands. The North American studies had several interventions, so increases could not be linked directly to predator control, and one found that increases were only at one of two sites studied.\nTwo controlled studies in Europe found little evidence that crow control led to increased reproductive success in gamebirds or raptors on islands. A North American study found that, despite higher reproductive success, very few birds returned to the study site after predator removal. A study from North America found that an Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica translocation programme, combined with the culling of predatory gulls, appeared to be successful.\nA study from the UK found that the number of common terns Sterna hirundo and black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus declined on gravel islands despite the attempted control of large gulls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasive and introduced avian predators can be problematic: islands with more introduced birds have lost more native bird species (Case 1996), but we have captured no evidence of the effects of their control or eradication. However, eight studies describe the effects of controlling or removing native predators on target bird populations.\nThe control of invasive and introduced competitor species is discussed in ‘Reduce competition with other species for nests sites’ and ‘Reduce competition with other species for food’.\nCase, T.J. (1996) Global patterns in the establishment and distribution of exotic birds. Biological Conservation, 78, 69–96."
