  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals that have habituated to humans. One study was in the USA and one was in the USA and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (2 studies): A study in the USA found that almost half of the translocated ‘nuisance’ black bears returned to their capture locations. A review of studies in the USA and Canada found that black bears translocated away from sites of conflict with humans were less likely to return to their capture site if translocated as younger bears, over greater distances, or across geographic barriers.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome animals, such as bears, may exhibit “nuisance behaviour” that may bring them into conflict with humans. For example, animals may attempt to raid foodstuffs at campgrounds and such individuals may then be perceived as representing a threat to humans. Animals may be translocated away from sites where issues arise, as an alternative to lethal control. Such translocations are deemed to be successful if the animal survives and resumes natural behaviour at the release site, does not return to the capture site and does not exhibit “nuisance behaviour” elsewhere.\nSee also: Residential and Commercial Development - Translocate problem mammals away from residential areas (e.g. habituated bears) to reduce human-wildlife conflict for situations where habituated animals are removed from established settlements rather than recreation areas. Also see Use non-lethal methods to deter carnivores from attacking humans."
