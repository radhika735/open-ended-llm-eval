  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of transferring plant material from intact grassland alongside seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Three studies were in Germany and one was in Hungary.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (3 STUDIES)\n\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies, one of which was paired) in Germany and Hungary found that transferring hay alongside sowing seeds did not alter target grass and forb species richness. The other study found that transferring hay alongside sowing seeds increased the species richness of target plants.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies, one of which was paired) in Germany and Hungary found that transferring hay alongside sowing seeds did not alter the cover of target grass and forb species. The other study found that transferring hay alongside sowing seeds increased the cover of target plant species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Germany found that transferring plant material alongside sowing seeds did not alter seedling emergence when small amounts of plant material were added, but seedling emergence was reduced when large amounts of plant material were added.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne method of introducing grassland seeds is by spreading plant material from intact grasslands. Combining this with sowing may further increase the chances of colonisation by grassland plants."
