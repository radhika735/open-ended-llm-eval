  "action_title": "Reduce adverse habitat alterations by excluding problematic terrestrial species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from the USA and the UK found higher numbers of certain songbird species and a higher species richness in these groups when deer were excluded from forests. Intermediate canopy-nesting species in the USA and common nightingales Luscinia macrorhynchos in the UK were the species to benefit.\nA study from Hawaii found mixed effects of grazer exclusion, with some species showing population increases, some declines and other different long- and short-term trends.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne possible response to problematic, habitat-altering species is to create exclusion areas, allowing natural habitats to regenerate away from the problematic species."
