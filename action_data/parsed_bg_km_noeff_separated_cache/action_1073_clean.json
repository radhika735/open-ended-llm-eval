  "action_id": "1073",
  "action_title": "Ponto-Caspian gobies: Changing pH",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the use of pH alteration to control goby populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome species of fish are sensitive to pH changes and this can offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed.  Draining ponds and altering the pH has been shown to be effective in local eradication of other fish species.  For example, a before-and-after study in the UK found that draining ponds and altering pH using lime slurry, eradicated topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva (Britton et al. 2008).\nBritton R., Brazier M., Davies G.D. & Chare S.I. (2008) Case studies on eradicating the Asiatic cyprinid Pseudorasbora parva from fishing lakes in England to prevent their riverine dispersal.  Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 18, 867-876."
