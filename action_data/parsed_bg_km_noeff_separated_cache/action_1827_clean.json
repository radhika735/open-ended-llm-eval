  "action_id": "1827",
  "action_title": "Add organic fertilizer (before/after planting)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adding organic fertilizer to areas planted with peatland plants.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic fertilizer (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can provide nutrients that are in short supply, thereby increasing the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants. Once successfully established, these plants are more likely to survive long term. Fertilizer would usually be added into the peat immediately before or after planting.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: add inorganic fertilizer to complement planting."
