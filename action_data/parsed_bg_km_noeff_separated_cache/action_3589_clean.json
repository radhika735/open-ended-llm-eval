  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of installing stormwater traps to prevent garbage from reaching rivers, coastal and marine environments.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGarbage from urban areas can enter marine and freshwater environments in stormwaters running off land via stormwater conduits and drainage systems (Armitage & Rooseboom 2000). Garbage can negatively affect marine reptiles, and all seven species of sea turtles are known to be affected by litter in the marine environment (Kühn et al. 2015). Stormwater traps or grids are designed to prevent garbage from entering stormwaters and may therefore reduce the amount reaching marine and freshwater environments (Armitage 2007).\nArmitage N. & Rooseboom A.
