  "action_title": "Use electric fencing to deter mammals from energy installations or mines",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using electric fencing to deter mammals from energy installations or mines.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals may cause damage to equipment if they enter energy installations or mines. There is also a direct risk to mammals from becoming trapped, falling into pits or being electrocuted. Electric fencing may be use around such sites to deter mammal entry. As well as reducing direct risks to mammals, if successful the intervention may also reduce the need to carry out lethal control of mammals on such sites.\nSee also: Agriculture and aquaculture - Install electric fencing to protect crops from mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Install electric fencing to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
