  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe have captured 11 replicated trials of bumblebee nest boxes. Several different types of nest box have been shown to be acceptable to bumblebees, including wooden or brick and tile boxes at the ground surface, underground tin, wooden or terracotta boxes and boxes attached to trees.\n\n \n\nThree replicated trials since 1989 in the UK have shown very low uptake rates (0-2.5%) of various nest box designs (not including underground nest boxes), while seven trials in previous decades in the UK, USA or Canada, and one recent trial in the USA, showed overall uptake rates between 10% and 48%.\n\n \n\nWooden surface or above ground nest boxes of the kind currently marketed for wildlife gardening are not the most effective design. Eight studies test this type of nest box. Five (pre-1978, USA or Canada) find 10-40% occupancy. Three (post-1989, UK) find very low occupancy of 0-1.5%. The four replicated trials that have directly compared wooden surface nest boxes with other types all report that underground, false underground or aerial boxes are more readily occupied.\n\n \n\nNest boxes entirely buried 5-10 cm underground, with a 30-80 cm long entrance pipe, are generally the most effective. Seven replicated trials in the USA, Canada or the UK have tested underground nest boxes and found between 6% and 58% occupancy. \n\n \n\nWe have captured no evidence for the effects of providing nest boxes on bumblebee populations.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWe are aware of at least three studies of bumblebee nest boxes in New Zealand, where bumblebees were introduced from the UK (Donovan & Weir 1978, Pomeroy 1981, Macfarlane et al. 1983). These studies find occupancy rates of 8-88% for different nest box designs, with the highest occupancy rate (88%) recorded for underground nest boxes in one study (reviewed in Lye 2009). They are not summarised by Conservation Evidence, because providing nest boxes for non-native and potentially invasive species is not a conservation intervention.\nAdditional references\nDonovan B.J. & Weir S.S.
