  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of thinning trees within forests on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Brazil, Spain and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Spain found that areas of thinned forest had similar reptile species richness compared to areas with no thinning. One study also found that thinned areas had lower species richness than areas of open habitat. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that areas of forest thinned 8–20 years previously had higher diversity of reptiles than areas thinned less than eight or more than 20 years previously, or than areas with no thinning.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): Two of four replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies) in Brazil, the USA, and Spain found that areas of thinned forest had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to areas with no thinning. One study found mixed effects of thinning trees on the abundance of three lizard species. The other study found that areas of thinned forest had a higher abundance of reptiles than areas with no thinning. That study also found that areas with the most thinning had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to areas of open habitat. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that areas of forest thinned 8–20 years previously had a higher abundance of reptiles than areas thinned at other times or areas with no thinning. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that areas of thinned forest had a higher abundance of snakes than clearcut forest.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is a forestry practice where selective removal of trees is used to increase the size and health of remaining trees in both wild-harvested and plantation forests. Ecological thinning (pre-commercial thinning) is a variant of thinning used in forest conservation where the primary aim is to increase growth of trees, but the secondary aim is to develop or improve wildlife habitat (e.g. hollows, sun gaps).\nFor studies of the effect of prescribed fires on their own and in combination with vegetation cutting, see Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning and Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing."
