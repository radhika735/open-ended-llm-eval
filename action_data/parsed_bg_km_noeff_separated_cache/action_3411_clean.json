  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of using slot/strip seeding on grassland vegetation. Both studies were in the UK.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nGrass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased grass species richness.\nForb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased forb species richness.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSlot or strip seeding involves drilling of seeds into shallow slots using specialized machinery. This potentially aids germination of grassland seeds by reducing seed removal by seed predators as well as allowing for lower application rates of seeds."
