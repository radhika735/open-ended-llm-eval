  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n \n\nTwo controlled studies from Iceland and Norway found higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups. This was post exposure to the disease-causing bacteria, Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri, respectively.\nTwo controlled studies inÂ Australia and Canadia reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease, post vaccination.\nTwo controlled studies in Norway reported similar results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAtlantic salmon cultured in commercial farms are at an increased risk of contracting and transferring infectious bacterial diseases and other pathogens. Administering vaccinations that target specific infections aims to reduce or eliminate disease contraction which may spread within the salmon farm, from wild salmon to cultured salmon and vice versa."
