  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll four studies from the UK and Switzerland (two replicated and controlled, and one review) investigating the effect of skylark plots on Eurasian skylarks, found a positive effect, reporting increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success or a lower likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory relative to fields without plots. A replicated study from Denmark found that skylarks used undrilled patches within cereal fields more than expected by an even distribution across the landscape.\nFour studies reported the effect of undrilled patches on wildlife other than skylarks. Three studies from the UK (including two replicated studies, of which one also controlled and a review) found benefits to plants and invertebrates. Whilst two studies (both replicated, one also controlled) from the UK found no significant differences in the number of some invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds between skylark plots and conventional crop fields. \nOne replicated study from the UK investigated different skylark plot establishment techniques. Plots that were undrilled had greater vegetation cover and height than plots established by spraying out with herbicide.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nEurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis require short vegetation to nest in. Skylark plots are small (usually 4-16 m2) undrilled patches within cereal fields which provide this short vegetation, with little impact on overall productivity. They are similar to lapwing plots (see ‘Leave uncropped, cultivated margins or plots (includes ‘lapwing plots’)) but much smaller."
