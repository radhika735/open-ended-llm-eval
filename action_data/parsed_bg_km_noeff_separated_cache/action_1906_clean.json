  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that large felids fed once every three days paced more frequently on non-feeding days.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the wild, a carnivore’s diet depends on the abundance and availability of prey. Therefore, many species do not feed every day. While it is not fully understood why captive animals perform stereotypic behaviours, it is thought they can be influenced by food restriction, causing appetitive behaviours that are deemed as repetitive and abnormal. In captivity, larger carnivore species are often fasted for one or more days per week with the aim of replicating natural feeding behaviour."
