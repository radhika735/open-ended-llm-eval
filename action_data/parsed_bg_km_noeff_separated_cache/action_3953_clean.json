  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reintroducing mammals as ecosystem engineers. This study was in Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Italy found that olive groves with wild boar present had a lower species richness of butterflies than groves without wild boar.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Italy found that olive groves with wild boar present had a lower total abundance of butterflies, and a lower abundance of six individual species, but a higher abundance of two species, than groves without wild boar.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge mammals can act as ecosystem engineers, altering the habitat around them. This often takes the form of disturbance: by grazing, browsing, uprooting or felling dominant plant species (Hess et al. 2014). This creates new habitats (such as bare ground, deadwood, or open water), which may benefit butterfly and moth species directly, or allow the establishment of less competitive plant species on which butterflies and moths depend (de Schaetzen et al. 2018). Common examples of mammals considered to be ecosystem engineers include elephants, wild boar (de Schaetzen et al. 2018), bison (Hess et al. 2014) and beavers.\nde Schaetzen F., van Langevelde F. & WallisDeVries M.F.
