  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation on grasslands. The study was in Hungary.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated study in Hungary found that sowing seeds in large gaps within vegetation led to a greater cover of sown target plant species than sowing in smaller gaps.\n\n VEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeeds may be sown within gaps (sometimes referred to as ‘establishment gaps’) created within existing grassland. Gaps are prepared prior to sowing by breaking up the grass sward and disturbing the soil, e.g. by digging. The aim is to reduce competition by resident grasses and provide optimal conditions for the establishment of sown target grassland species. This may be particularly beneficial within dense species-poor grasslands."
