  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of retaining unmown field margins on bats populations. The study was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the UK found that pipistrelle activity (relative abundance) did not differ between unmown field margins managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and field margins on conventional farms.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nField margins can provide foraging habitat for bats. Leaving field margins unmown and allowing them to regenerate naturally can increase the abundance and diversity of plants and invertebrate prey. Unmown field margins are likely to be particularly beneficial when close to other bat habitats, such as woodland or tall field boundaries with trees (McHugh et al. 2019).\nSee also ‘Plant field margins with a diverse mix of plant species’. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.\nMcHugh N.M., Bown B.L., Hemsley J.A. & Holland J.M.
