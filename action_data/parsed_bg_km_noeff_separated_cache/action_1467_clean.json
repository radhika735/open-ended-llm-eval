  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of implementing no-hunting seasons for primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention ensures that there are times during the year where it is illegal to kill particular species. This time period can vary from weeks, to months or even years, depending on the species, geography, and local customs. The closed season is usually timed to prevent hunting during times of peak reproductive activity, temperature extremes, low population levels and food shortage."
