  "action_title": "Incorporate parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nPest damage: One controlled study from New Zealand found using parasitism rates to inform spraying decisions resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests. Effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored.\nThe crop studied was tomato.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis involves monitoring parasitism rates of pests by natural enemies and adjusting thresholds for insecticide use accordingly. Conventional threshold-based insecticide use (such as in integrated management) monitors pest populations or crop damage to schedule insecticide applications, but may not consider the action of natural enemies. Parasitoids can reduce pest populations, but there may be a lag between pest population increase and parasitoid population increase. If pests are killed by insecticides during this lag period, parasitoids may also be killed, preventing the parasitoid population from increasing and limiting the ecosystem service they provide. Monitoring parasitism rates to decide whether or not and when to spray is intended to avoid this and reduce unnecessary use of insecticides."
