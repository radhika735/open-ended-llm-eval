  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of chilling their seeds before sowing. All six studies were in the USA. Five of the studies were in laboratories or greenhouses.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (6 studies): All six replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that chilling (at 1–10°C) seeds of herbaceous plants before sowing either increased or had no significant effect on their germination rate. Within studies, the direction and/or size of the effect depended on factors such as the duration of chilling, species, conditions (light/temperature) after sowing, and sowing site (restored vs natural meadows). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that freezing sawgrass Cladium jamaicense seeds before sowing reduced their germination rate.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nExposing seeds to cold temperatures before planting can help to break seed dormancy and encourage germination. Some species with physiological dormancy must experience a cold period before germinating, in order to break down chemicals that inhibit germination or stop the production of these chemicals. For a database of seed dormancy class by species, see Baskin & Baskin (2014).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.\nBaskin C.C. & Baskin J.M.
