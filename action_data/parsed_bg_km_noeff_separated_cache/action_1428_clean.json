  "action_title": "Compensate farmers for produce loss caused by primates",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCompensation schemes can be used to reduce the loss of income due to crop losses caused by primates. A study on wolves found that individual compensation appeared to have reduced the resentment of farmers to Canis lupus taking their livestock around Yellowstone National Park in the USA (Nyhus et al. 2003). The effectiveness of compensation schemes, however, is often undermined by difficulties in verifying claims by farmers (Mc Guinness & Taylor 2014).\n            Compensation schemes to cover the farmer’s costs to deter primates are discussed under ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of strategies to deter primates that are not harmful to primates’.\n \nMc Guinness S. & Taylor D. (2014) Farmers’ perceptions and actions to decrease crop raiding by forest-dwelling primates around a Rwandan forest fragment. Human Dimensions of Wildlife, 19, 179–190.\nNyhus P., Fischer H., Madden F. & Osofsky S. (2003) Taking the bite out of wildlife damage: the challenges of wildlife compensation schemes. Conservation in Practice. 4, 37–40."
