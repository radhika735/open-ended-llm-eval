  "action_id": "1166",
  "action_title": "Remove nitrogen and phosphorus using harvested products",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence of the effects of removing nitrogen and phosphorus using harvested products on forests.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome ecosystems in human-dominated landscapes have a surplus of nitrogen and phosphorus, mainly resulting from agriculture, industry and traffic. These surpluses can be removed by harvesting forest biomass. However, long term intensive harvesting may reduce soil fertility and hence vegetation productivity."
