  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in IrelandÂ found that altering the location of food decreased pacing behaviours in cheetahs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredictability in feeding regimes has been linked to potential anticipatory behaviours such as pacing and higher levels of aggression. Varying the location of feeding may make the feeding routine less predictable and therefore reduce pacing and increase foraging behaviours."
