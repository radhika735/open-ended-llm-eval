  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of increasing the visual detectability of fishing gear for mammals. One study was in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada) and one was in Cape Cod Bay (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One study in the Gulf of St. Lawrence found that minke whales approached white ropes more slowly and changed their bearing more when approaching black ropes compared to ropes of other colours. One study in Cape Cod Bay found that simulated ropes painted red or orange were detected by North Atlantic right whales at greater distances than green but not black ropes, and more whales collided with green ropes than the other three rope colours.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIncreasing the visual detectability of fishing gear to marine and freshwater mammals may allow mammals to detect and avoid gear reducing the risk of entanglements. This intervention may involve changing the colour, pattern, or luminosity of gear materials, or attaching markers or LED lights to gear."
