  "action_id": "3349",
  "action_title": "Allow plants to adjust to field conditions before planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of allowing emergent vegetation to adjust to field conditions before planting in wetlands.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlants may have higher survival and growth rates if they are allowed to gradually adjust to conditions similar to those in the site where they will be planted (also known as “acclimation” or “hardening off”). Factors such as temperature, salinity or nutrient concentrations might be changed gradually in the greenhouse or laboratory, from the benign conditions in which plants were raised to the conditions in the field.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of acclimated and non-acclimated plants. Studies that simply report the performance of acclimated plants are not summarized here."
