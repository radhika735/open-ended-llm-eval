  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nForestry practices and particularly clear-cutting all trees and vegetation can have significant effects on amphibian populations. There are a number of silviculture management practices that can be carried out to try to reduce the effect of timber harvest on wildlife. These include retaining some scattered or groups of trees, which ensures that some canopy cover remains and therefore that forest floor or stream conditions are maintained in some areas."
