  "action_title": "Foster eggs or chicks of ibises with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA 2007 literature review describes attempting to foster northern bald ibis Geronticus eremite chicks with cattle egrets Bubulcus ibis as unsuccessful.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf the wild populations of a species are very small then it may not be possible to foster offspring to conspecifics. However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range."
