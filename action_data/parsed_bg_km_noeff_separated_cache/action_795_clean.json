  "action_id": "795",
  "action_title": "Use signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAmphibian species are able to tolerate different levels of disturbance. For particularly sensitive species or populations, or in areas subject to high levels of disturbance, it may be possible to reduce human disturbance with signs or access restrictions. Reducing access helps to reduce the risk of human introduction of non-native plants, animals or disease."
