  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. All studies were in the North Sea (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, UK).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing developed different overall invertebrate community compositions compared to fished areas.\nOverall species richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing did not develop different overall invertebrate species richness and diversity compared to fished areas after three years, but the other found higher species richness in the closed areas after 20 years.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing had similar overall invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to fished areas after three and five years.\nCrustacean abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing a site to all fishing led to similar numbers of lobster compared to a fished site after 20 months.\nCrustacean condition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing a site to all fishing led to larger sizes of lobster compared to a fished site after 20 months.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community energy flow (1 study): One before-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that, during the 12–14 months after closing an area to all fishing, the invertebrate community structure (measured as energy flow) at sites within the closed area did not change, but that it increased in nearby fished sites.\nSpecies energy flow (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing an area to all fishing for 12–14 months had mixed effects on species-level energy flow.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing in an area can remove the most direct pressures to subtidal benthic invertebrates, with the aim of enabling previously impacted populations to recover over time (Jack & Wing 2010). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Cease or prohibit shipping” and “Threat: Biological resource use – Establish temporary fisheries closure”. When this intervention is undertaken within a protected area, evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all types of fishing”.\n \nCollie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. & Poiner I.R.
