  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of providing sustainable alternative livelihoods; establish fish- or domestic meat farms on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention aims to replace primate bushmeat with other domestic- or wild animal protein sources, such as e.g. fish, snails, chickens, pigs, or goats, which are bred and raised at small-scale animal farms. Some very abundant wild mammal species (e.g. agricultural pests) may also be used as a food source and potentially serve as substitutes for primate bushmeat. An example of such a species is the greater cane rat Thryonomys swinderianus, which is raised in cages and sold for meat in many African countries. A correlative study by Junker et al. (2015) found that in areas where fish protein was relatively affordable to people, chimpanzee density was higher than in other areas, suggesting that people may replace bushmeat with fish protein when they can afford it.\n \nJunker J., Boesch C., Mundry R., Stephens C., Lormie M., Tweh C. & Kühl H.S. (2015) Education and access to fish but not economic development predict chimpanzee and mammal occurrence in West Africa. Biological Conservation, 182, 27–35."
