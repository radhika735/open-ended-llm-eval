  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of installing crossings over/under pipelines on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPipelines can extend hundreds of kms and may represent substantial barriers to reptile movements if they lie at or just above the surface of the ground. Crossing points can be either elevated sections of pipe with space for reptiles to pass beneath, buried sections or sections with crossing ramps constructed over the pipe."
