  "action_title": "Raise awareness amongst the general public to promote conservation actions",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of raising awareness amongst the general public to promote conservation actions for butterflies and moths.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThreats to butterflies and moths, as well as actions for their conservation, can come from members of the public. Therefore, raising awareness of the impact of individual actions on species conservation may improve butterfly and moth conservation outcomes. Behaviours and beliefs which create threats, and which awareness raising should aim to minimize, could include the use of insecticides, the release of non-native animals and plants into the wild (for example from gardens), and a general fear of invertebrates or of moths specifically. Conversely, behaviours which awareness raising may wish to encourage could include planting nectar and pollen-rich native plants, or reducing weeding or mowing, in gardens. Awareness raising programmes could include education and outreach events, as well as citizen science projects (Dennis et al. 2017, Richter et al. 2018).\nDennis E.B., Morgan B.J.T., Brereton T.M., Roy D.B. & Fox R. (2017) Using citizen science butterfly counts to predict species population trends. Conservation Biology, 31, 1350–1361.\nRichter A.
