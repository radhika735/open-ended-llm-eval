  "action_title": "Integrate marshes or swamps into developed areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of incorporating marshes or swamps into developed areas.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarsh or swamp habitats could be intentionally retained within developed areas (e.g. Densu Delta Ramsar Site in Accra, Ghana). Alternatively or additionally, they could be created or restored within existing developments – at a range of scales, from the 30-ha London Wetland Centre to green roofs on individual buildings (Song et al. 2013). Wetlands within developed areas can provide numerous benefits to people within developed areas, from water storage and purification to recreation and relaxation (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2018). An assessment of the effects of conservation on such “ecosystem services” is beyond the scope of this synopsis.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should evaluate its overall effects, e.g. by comparing comparisons of plant diversity in marshes or swamps before and after development that deliberately retained these habitats. Assessments of vegetation within specific protected, restored or created sites are summarized under other actions. \nRelated actions: Retain/create habitat linkages in developed areas; Designate protected area and Provide general protection for marshes or swamps, including policies and laws to protect these habitats in developed areas.\nRamsar Convention Secretariat (2018) Wetlands: Essential for a Sustainable Urban Future.
