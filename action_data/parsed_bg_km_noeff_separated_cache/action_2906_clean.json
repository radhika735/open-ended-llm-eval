  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using methods to reduce sediment disturbance during dredging, on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDredging disturbs the river or seabed, resulting in sediment plumes and increased turbidity, which may have negative impacts on marine and freshwater mammals (Todd et al. 2015). Methods may be used to reduce sediment disturbance during dredging. For example, fabric curtains or screens may be erected around the dredging site to retain suspended sediments (Oglivie et al. 2012).\nSee also Use methods to dampen underwater noise emissions (e.g. bubble curtains, screens).\nOglivie J., Middlemiss D., Lee M., Crossouard N. & Feates N.
