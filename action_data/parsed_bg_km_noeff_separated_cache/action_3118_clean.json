  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide increased overall plant diversity, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone. However, burning had no significant effect on plant species richness.\nNative/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant species richness, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on the density of non-planted tree seedlings, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species two growing seasons later.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed burns can be used to manage problematic plants that may overgrow and outcompete desirable vegetation. By removing above-ground vegetation, fire can also be used to manage the physical vegetation structure (Flores et al. 2011). Prescribed burns may have only temporary effects: many plants can regrow from remaining stumps, roots or rhizomes (underground horizontal stems).\nPotential benefits of management by prescribed burning should be weighed up against potential risks. For example, it can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of a prescribed burn: burning when the ground is wet and/or cold might be safer (Hackney & de la Cruz 1981). Burning can damage seed banks, and might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term followed by a rapid return to a degraded state. Burning can also damage the physical habitat (e.g. by exposing sediments, increasing erosion and reducing accumulation of organic matter; McKee & Grace 2012) and may be harmful to animals like amphibians (Smith & Sutherland 2014) and birds (Flores et al. 2011).\nThe timing and duration of monitoring might be particularly important when evaluating the effects of this action. Burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term, followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance; Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Reduce intensity of prescribed burning; Change season/timing of prescribed burning.\nFlores C., Bounds D.L. & Ruby D.E.
