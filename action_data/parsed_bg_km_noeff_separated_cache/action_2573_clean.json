  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on potential prey mammals of sterilizing predators. This study was in the USA and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA and CanadaÂ found that sterilising some wolves (combined with trapping and removing others) did not increase caribou survival.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredators can limit population sizes of prey species. Changes in habitat or land management can lead to increases in predator populations which might negatively affect prey. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproduction success of prey species. Sterilization of predators may be proposed as an alternative strategy that may be regarded as being more acceptable than removal or lethal control."
