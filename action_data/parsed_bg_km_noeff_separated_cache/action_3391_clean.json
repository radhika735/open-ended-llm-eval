  "action_title": "Provide education/training programmes about marshes or swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of providing education/training programmes related to marshes or swamps. One study was in Kenya and one was in Vietnam.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nHuman behaviour (2 studies): One study in Kenya reported that after a series of seminars and workshops about marsh conservation, two community-based management groups were established by local stakeholders and a grazing fee was introduced. One before-and-after study in Vietnam reported that after local people were trained to make more complex handicrafts from marsh plants (along with helping them to sell those handicrafts in markets), their income increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves education programmes, training courses or workshops, aimed at people who directly use, manage or influence marshes and swamps (e.g. managers, farmers in the catchment, local people). Education or training may be about these habitats in general (e.g. their wildlife, their value to humans) or about management techniques (including sustainable water use and land use practices). It may aim to increase the income of local people using marshes or swamps, in order to sustain their livelihoods without intensification or expansion of environmentally damaging activities (but consider that higher incomes could also encourage expansion of activities, as in farmed dambos in Malawi/Zambia; Wetlands International 2009). Education or training may be specifically about vegetation, or about broader aspects of marsh or swamp habitats.\nTo be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the education or training programmes are substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if they involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).\nRelated actions: Designate protected area involving marshes or swamps, which may be supported by education or training; Pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps, which may involve education or training; Raise public awareness about marshes or swamps, other than with formal education or training.\nWetlands International (2009) Planting Trees to Eat Fish: Field Experiences in Wetlands and Poverty Reduction.
