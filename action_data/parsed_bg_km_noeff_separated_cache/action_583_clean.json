  "action_id": "583",
  "action_title": "Ensure genetic variation to increase translocation success",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe did not find any studies on the effects of ensuring genetic variation in translocated birds.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf translocated birds are used to recolonise a part of the speciesâ€™ former range then they will constitute a founder population. If the founders do not have sufficient genetic variation, their breeding may lead to inbreeding depression, potentially jeopardising the long-term viability of the population."
