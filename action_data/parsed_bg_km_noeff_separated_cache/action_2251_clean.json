  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of refilling disused borrow pits on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in Barnegat Bay estuary (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Barnegat Bay estuary found that overall invertebrate species richness and diversity increased at a disused borrow pit after being refilled with sediments but remained lower than at a natural non-dredged site.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Barnegat Bay estuary found that overall invertebrate abundance increased at a disused borrow pit after being refilled with sediments but remained lower than at a natural non-dredged site.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes (De Groot 1996). Extraction leads to physical impacts and disruption of the seabed, including the formation of borrow pits, also known as dredged holes (Reine et al. 2013). Borrow pits tend to be very different from the surrounding natural seabed, being much deeper, isolated, and of different sediment type. The natural seabed ecology could be restored by refilling the disused borrow pits following cessation of extraction (Reine et al. 2013). This can potentially help the recolonization and natural recovery of the invertebrate community.\nEvidence for interventions related to aggregate extraction is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Mining and quarrying”.\n \nDe Groot S.J.
