  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of prohibiting the harvesting of conch in marine protected areas on their populations and/or other subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the North Atlantic Ocean (British Overseas Territories).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nMollusc abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that a marine protected area prohibiting the commercial harvest of conch had more conch after five years compared to a fished area.\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that a marine protected area prohibiting the commercial harvest of conch had smaller adult conch after five years compared to a fished area.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConch populations have significantly declined due to overharvesting for commercial and recreational purposes (Theile 2001). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to cease or prohibit the harvest of conch (Béné & Tewfik 2003; Stoner et al. 2012). Inside protected areas where this activity is prohibited, the threat from conch harvesting to conch populations and associated benthic communities is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Stoner et al. 2012). When this intervention occurred outside of a marine protected area, evidence for the effects on conch populations is summarised under “Species management – Cease or prohibit the harvest of conch”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use”.\n \nBéné C. & Tewfik A.
