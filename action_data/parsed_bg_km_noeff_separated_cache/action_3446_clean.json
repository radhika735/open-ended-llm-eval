The study was on an open coastline in Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAlgal abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy found that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of the topography depth.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Natural rocky reef topography’ refers to the full fingerprint of substrate topography found in natural rocky habitats.\nTopography influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms on subtidal rocky substrates. Variation in topography generates variation in the physical environment and plays an important role in sustaining biodiversity and ecological functioning (Levin 1974). On rocky reefs, many habitat features that offer refuge from physical stressors and predation, such as bumps, crevices and holes, are generated as a function of substrate topography and geomorphology. The full fingerprint of natural rocky reef topography encompasses a variety of habitat features of different scales interacting within a mosaic.\nMarine artificial structures often have much lower topographic variability than natural rocky reefs, which is thought to be a key reason for their reduced biodiversity (Wilhelmsson & Malm 2008). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on subtidal artificial structures by moulding or casting material during construction or retrospectively (see Evans et al. 2021).\nSee also: Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create large ridges or ledges (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures.\nEvans A.J., Lawrence P.J., Natanzi A.S., Moore P.J., Davies A.J., Crowe T.P., McNally C., Thompson B., Dozier A.E. & Brooks P.R.
