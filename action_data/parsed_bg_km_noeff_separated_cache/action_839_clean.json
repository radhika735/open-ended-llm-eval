  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredation of amphibians by mammal species can have a significant effect on populations, particularly if the mammal species is not native or the amphibian population is small.\nThere is a large amount of literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling non-native mammal predators, which may be undertaken for the conservation of a range of taxa including amphibians (e.g. Genovesi 2005; Morley 2006).\nGenovesi, P. (2005) Eradications of invasive alien species in Europe: a review. Biological Invasions, 7, 127–133.\nMorley C.G.
