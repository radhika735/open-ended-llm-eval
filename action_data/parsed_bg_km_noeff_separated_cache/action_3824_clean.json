  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of implementing multi-species management strategies on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe status of commercial fish stocks is typically assessed separately by species and managed using reference points or target yields estimated for a single species. However, where there is a large number of species in the catch, this can make it difficult for these multi- or mixed-species fisheries to comply with management requirements because fishing may have a greater impact on some species than others. Management strategies that evaluate the risks and effects of management for all species, may help to ensure that fish caught in multiple species fisheries are protected from overexploitation and have more sustainable populations. This approach needs to take into account the possibility that in a multispecies assemblage, one highly desirable species with a low total allowable catch could trigger an early closure of the whole assemblage by becoming what is known as a ‘choke’ species, of which an example is cod in the mixed gadoid fishery in the North Sea (Ulrich et al. 2011).\nUlrich C., Reeves S.A., Vermard Y., Holmes S.J. & Vanhee W.
