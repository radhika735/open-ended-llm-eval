  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effects of landscaping or artificially enhancing the seabed on subtidal benthic invertebrates. One study was in the North Sea (UK), one in the Westerschelde estuary (Netherlands), and one in the Persian Gulf (Kuwait).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (2 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea found that following addition of gravels, invertebrate community composition became more similar to natural seabed communities. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in invertebrate community composition following addition of sedimentary dredge material.\nOverall richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea and one site comparison study in the Persian Gulf found that invertebrate species richness increased following addition of gravels or coral and limestone rubbles, and one also found that richness became similar to natural seabed. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in species richness following addition of sedimentary dredged material.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (3 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea and one site comparison study in the Persian Gulf found that invertebrate abundance and biomass increased following addition of gravels or coral and limestone rubbles, and one also found that abundance became similar to natural seabed. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in invertebrate abundance and biomass following addition of sedimentary dredge material.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLandscaping or artificial enhancement can be undertaken as a restoration method aimed to promote the recovery and recolonization processes of subtidal benthic invertebrates. This could also constitute a pre-restoration method to improve the seabed and potentially enhance further restoration. For instance, following cessation of marine aggregate extraction, to try recreating the natural substrate, a layer of gravel or shell can be added to the seabed or the sediment can be landscaped (Cooper et al. 2011; de Jong et al. 2015). Broken limestone rubble or empty shellfish shells have also been laid on the seabed to enhance the natural habitat and enhance recolonization of natural biodiversity (Fariñas-Franco et al. 2013; Jones & Nithyanandan 2013; Meyer & Townsend 2000).\n \nCooper K., Ware S., Vanstaen K. & Barry J.
