  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo replicated and controlled studies in the South Atlantic and sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean found significant reductions in the number of albatross and petrels attacking baits and being caught when offal was released overboard during line setting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany fishing boats prepare fish onboard, after catching them, in order to maximise the catch that can be stored. The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Moreno et al. 1996 describe the highest bycatch rates of a series of voyages coming from a vessel that piped offal overboard on the same side that the line was being set. However, other studies suggest that piping offal overboard from a different point to where the lines are being set will reduce bycatch, as birds spend their time eating the offal, rather than attempting to take bait.\nMoreno, C.A., Rubilar, P.S., Marschoff, E. & Benzaquen, L. (1996) Factors affecting the incidental mortality of seabirds in the Dissostichus eleginoides fishery in the southwest Atlantic (subarea 48.3, 1995 season). CCAMLR Science, 3, 79â€“91."
