  "action_title": "Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of cutting/mowing in marshes or swamps (or cutting/mowing them at different intensities).\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the effects of different disturbance intensities, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve the target vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared cutting/mowing at different intensities (e.g. the proportion of the vegetation that is cut) but with the same frequency and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). Note that studies comparing areas that remain uncut to areas that become cut, at any intensity, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes);     Change season/timing of cutting/mowing (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes);     Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes);     Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).\nConnell, J.H.
