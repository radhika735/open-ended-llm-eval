  "action_title": "Restore habitat corridors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of restoring habitat corridors on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs an alternative to protecting natural habitat for primates, restoring damaged habitats or creating new habitat patches may help to maintain/increase primate populations. Habitat restoration or creation is often required by law as a response to mining or other activities that destroy large areas of natural habitats. This intervention may entail planting vegetation, removing invasive species, or creating shelter habitats and sleeping sites for example."
