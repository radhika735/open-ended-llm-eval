  "action_id": "1041",
  "action_title": "American bullfrog control: Habitat modification",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effects of habitat modification on the control of American bullfrogs.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat modification such as increasing shade for native species, removing protective cover, or breaking up wet travel corridors may offer a technique to indirectly reduce bullfrog populations and establish or increase native amphibian populations.  For example, bullfrogs have been found to be less abundant in ponds with shallow sloping banks and extensive emergent vegetation (Adams et al. 2003).\nAdams M. J., Pearl C. A. & Bury R. B. (2003). Indirect facilitation of an anuran invasion by non-native fishes. Ecology Letters, 6, 343–351."
