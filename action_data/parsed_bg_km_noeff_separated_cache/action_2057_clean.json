  "action_title": "Limit the amount of stabilisation material used",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the amount of stabilisation material used on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStabilisation material, such as concrete mattresses and rocks (rock dump), can be used to keep pipelines and infrastructure (from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining or aggregate extraction) in place and may also help to protect the infrastructure (for instance from fishing gears) by covering them. This process and material can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbances, loss of natural sediment, and changes in habitat characteristics. Limiting the amount of stabilisation material used can reduce the threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates by reducing the amount of physical damage and habitat loss. Evidence for other interventions related to the use of stabilisation material are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Use stabilisation material that can be more easily recovered at decommissioning stage”."
