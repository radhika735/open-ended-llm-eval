  "action_title": "Temporarily hold females and offspring in fenced area to increase survival of young",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of temporarily holding females and offspring in a fenced area to increase survival of young.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSurvival of new-born mammals can be low, due to a variety of factors including predation. Capturing pregnant females and temporarily holding them and their new-born offspring in fenced areas within their native range (short-term or ‘maternal penning’), for the first few weeks of life when young are most vulnerable to predation, may result in increased survival of young. This could help to slow decline, maintain or increase population size."
