  "action_title": "Convert or revert arable land to permanent grassland",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll seven individual studies (including four replicated studies, of which two also controlled and a review) looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife. The studies monitored UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic. \nOne of the studies, a controlled before-and-after study from the UK, showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention involves changing from an arable crop to a sown agricultural grassland, to be used for grazing or silage. It is not the same as the creation of species-rich or other semi-natural grasslands.\nSee also ‘Provide (or retain) set-aside areas’ for some studies where non-rotational set-aside land was sown with grass, but managed as set-aside rather than as permanent agricultural grassland."
