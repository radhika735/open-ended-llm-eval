  "action_title": "Thin trees within forests: effects on young trees",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix of twelve studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Japan and the USA found that thinning trees in forests increased the density of young trees. One study found that thinning decreased the density of young trees. Five found no effect or mixed effects on the density of young trees. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of thinning on the density of oak acorns.\nOne controlled study in Peru found that thinning increased the growth rate of young trees.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is the removal of trees to control the development or enhance the future condition of a forest, by adjusting its density, structure and species composition.\nStudies looking at tree removal with the aim of removing biomass are discussed in 'Logging/tree removal within forest'."
