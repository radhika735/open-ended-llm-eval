  "action_title": "Recharge groundwater to restore wetland forest",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of recharging groundwater to restore wetland forest.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn human-dominated landscapes groundwater levels may become depleted due to overuse of water, or may be kept artificially low for agricultural purposes. This can cause nearby wetland forests to experience drought. Allowing the groundwater level to rise again could help to restore wetland forests."
