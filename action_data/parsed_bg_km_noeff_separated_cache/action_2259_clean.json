  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies examined the effects of creating artificial reefs of different typology on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. One study was in the English Channel (UK), three in the Mediterranean Sea (Israel, Italy), one in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA), one in the Firth of Lorn (UK), one in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), and one in the Gulf of Mexico (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (3 studies): One controlled study in the English Channel found that artificial reef modules made of scrap tyres developed a similar sessile invertebrate community composition as traditional artificial concrete modules. Two controlled studies (one replicated) in the Mediterranean Sea found that pyramids reefs made of “sea-friendly” concrete developed different invertebrate community compositions compared to reefs of either traditional concrete plinth-pole structures or bundles of traditional concrete tubes.\nOverall richness/diversity (5 studies): Four controlled studies (three replicated) in the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico found no differences in overall invertebrate richness/diversity or combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness between reef structure and/or material. One controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that invertebrate species richness was lower on “sea-friendly” pyramid reefs compared to bundle reefs of traditional concrete.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (5 studies): Four controlled studies (three replicated) in the English Channel, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances or combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance between reef structure and/or material. One controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that “sea-friendly” concrete pyramids had lower abundance compared to plinth-pole structures after two years, but higher after three.\nCrustacean abundance (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that artificial reefs made of limestone boulders, gravel concrete aggregate, or tyre-concrete aggregate had similar abundance of spiny lobsters. One replicated, controlled study in the Firth of Lorn found that the complexity of artificial reef modules had mixed effects on the abundance of edible crab and velvet swimming crab.\nMollusc abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Gulf of Mexico found that breakwaters made of bags of oyster shells recruited more oysters and ribbed mussels compared to “ReefBall” breakwaters.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial reefs are man-made structures intentionally put into the marine environment to act similarly to a natural reef. Originally used to improve fisheries and biological resources, they have been shown to be ecologically beneficial by locally increasing biodiversity (Bohnsack & Sutherland 1985; Clark & Edwards 1999). Various construction material and architectural arrangements can be used when creating an artificial reef to manipulate its 3-D structure and level of complexity, for instance by using pyramidal structures instead of tubes, or using “sea-friendly” reinforced concrete instead of traditional common concrete (Ponti et al. 2015; Spagnolo et al. 2014). The architecture and characteristics of the artificial reef can influence which species of subtidal benthic invertebrates colonize the reefs, in what abundances, at what rate, and how long they can survive. The 3-D structure and material used to create an artificial reef can be selected to potentially enhance marine subtidal biodiversity.\nEvidence related to creating artificial reefs in general, without considering 3-D structures or construction material, is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs”.\n \nBohnsack J.A. & Sutherland D.L.
