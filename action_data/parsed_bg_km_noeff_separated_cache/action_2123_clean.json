  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of using an otter trawl instead of a dredge on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Irish Sea (Isle of Man).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch overall composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught a different species composition of unwanted invertebrate and fish species (combined) compared to two scallop dredges.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found no difference in total invertebrate abundance and biomass living in or on the sediment of the trawl tracks following fishing with either an otter trawl or two scallop dredges.\nUnwanted catch overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught fewer unwanted invertebrates and fish (combined) compared to two scallop dredges.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Irish Sea found that an otter trawl caught similar number of commercially targeted queen scallops compared to two scallop dredges.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDredging, for instance for bivalves, normally involves towing a heavy steel frame along the seabed, which negatively impacts subtidal benthic invertebrates due to direct physical damage and the retention of unwanted invertebrate catch, and indirectly by changes to the seabed structure and topography, such as creating dredge tracks (Currie & Parry 1996). Otter trawls have a pair of boards or metal plates (otter boards) which attach to the sides of the net and keep the net open as it is pulled through the water (Schwinghamer et al. 1998). Although otter boards can damage the seabed, they may cause less damage than a dredge due to the limited surface area in contact with the seabed in comparison to a dredge. Using an otter trawl instead of a dredge may potentially lessen the negative impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hinz et al. 2012). Evidence for using other fishing gear instead of an otter trawl is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Use an otter trawl instead of a beam trawl”. Evidence for other interventions related to using different fishing gear is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use”.\n \nCurrie D.R. & Parry G.D.
