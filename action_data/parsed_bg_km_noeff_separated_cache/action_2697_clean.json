  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nForty-two studies examined the effects of using a larger mesh size of fishing net on marine fish populations. Ten studies, and one review, were in the Atlantic Ocean (UK, Portugal, USA). Eight studies were in the Aegean Sea (Greece, Turkey). Five studies were in the North Sea (UK, Netherlands, France, North Europe) and three were in the Tasman Sea (Australia). Two studies were in each of the Mediterranean Sea (Italy, Turkey), the Pacific Ocean (USA, Chile), the Skagerrak and Kattegat (Northern Europe) and the Gulf of Mexico (Mexico). One study was in each of the English Channel (UK), the Bering Sea (USA), the Baltic Sea (Finland), the Caribbean Sea (Barbados), the Persian Gulf (Kuwait), the Bristol Channel (UK), the Barents Sea (Norway) and the Arabian Sea (India). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (3 studies): One of three controlled studies (one replicated and paired, and one replicated) in the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea and Bristol Channel found that larger mesh sizes improved the post-capture survival of skates and rays compared to smaller meshes. The other two found similar post-capture survival in haddock, whiting and small herring between trawl nets with larger mesh and nets of smaller mesh size.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Bristol Channel reported that the condition of skates and rays at capture was better with a larger trawl codend mesh size compared to a smaller mesh.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (41 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (21 studies): Fifteen of 20 replicated studies (five controlled, two paired, eight paired and controlled, one randomized and one randomized and controlled) in the North Sea, Skagerrak/Kattegat, Aegean Sea, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Tasman Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea and the Bristol Channel found that using a larger mesh size in a fishing net (various trawls, gillnets, seines and trammel nets) reduced the catches of unwanted (small/undersized, non-commercial, discarded) fish or fish and invertebrates combined, compared to nets with standard/smaller mesh sizes. One study found that amounts of unwanted fish were reduced with larger mesh at smaller catch sizes but were similar between large and small meshes at larger catch sizes, and one found that increasing a trawl codend mesh size reduced the unwanted catch of one of two fish species compared to a standard mesh. Three found that larger mesh sized fishing nets did not typically reduce the unwanted fish catch compared to nets of smaller mesh sizes. One study found that increasing both the mesh size and minimum size limit reduced catches of the youngest fish.\nImproved size-selectivity of fishing gear (23 studies): Nineteen of 21 replicated studies (eight controlled, four paired and controlled, three randomized and controlled, and one paired) and one review, in the North Sea, Aegean Sea, Baltic Sea, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Tasman Sea, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Barents Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that larger mesh sizes (both diamond and square) of the netting of various gear types improved the size-selectivity for all fish species assessed and in one, for two of three fish species, compared to smaller mesh sizes. One study found that size-selectivity for fish was not improved with larger mesh size in the netting of fish traps. The other found that increasing the codend mesh size of trawls fitted with size-sorting escape grids resulted in similar size-selectivity of the codend for fish compared to smaller codend mesh sizes. One controlled study in the English Channel found that a trawl net codend with a larger size of square mesh had similar size-selectivity for Atlantic mackerel as a smaller diamond mesh codend.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNumerous fishing methods involve the use of panels of meshed netting to harvest the target species. Fishing with a net may be active (or mobile) whereby the net is dragged or hauled through the water, or it may be passive whereby the net is deployed in a fixed or semi-fixed location for a period of time. The size and shape of fish that are caught by the net is determined by the shape and the size of the mesh. As well as the target fish, fishing nets may catch immature and undersized fish or fish of unwanted species. To reduce the amount of unwanted species and/or smaller sizes caught, and thus make the net more selective, a larger size of mesh may allow unwanted individuals to escape capture while retaining the commercially targeted species or sizes (Burgos‐León et al. 2009).\nNote: The mesh sizes reported here are typically the ‘nominal’ measurements of the mesh sizes’ given in the studies, i.e. the approximate intended size of the meshes in a net. The actual mesh size, usually measured as the average size of several meshes stretched under tension, may vary depending on factors like the configuration of the knots or twine characteristics. In addition, during use, the effective size (or gap opening) of the meshes may also change with how the net is deployed (e.g. towing speed for trawl nets) and the size of the catch.\nEvidence for interventions describing other modifications to fishing net mesh (size and/or shape) is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification – Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend on trawl nets; Modify gillnet or entangling (trammel/tangle) net configuration’ and ‘Rotate the orientation of diamond mesh in a trawl net’.\nBurgos‐León A., Pérez‐Castañeda R. & Defeo O.
