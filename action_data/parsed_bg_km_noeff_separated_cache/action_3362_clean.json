  "action_title": "Soak trees/shrubs before planting: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of brackish/saline wetlands – of soaking them before planting.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoaking vegetation before planting might increase tissue water content, promote root growth and increase survival after planting (Pezeshki et al. 2005). An abundance of roots might help the planted vegetation to take up enough water during dry periods. Adventitious roots may grow from the stem, near the water line, and help with oxygen uptake if the site is flooded or saturated (Havens 1996). Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of soaked and unsoaked plants. Studies that simply report the performance of pruned plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak seeds before sowing.\nHavens K.J.
