  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated study from the USA found that the survival of cross-fostered yellow warbler Dendroica petechia chicks was lower than previously-published rates for the species, although incubation and nestling periods were very similar.\nA replicated and controlled study from Norway found that the success of cross-fostering small songbirds varied depending on the species of chick and foster birds. However, only great tits P. major raised by blue tits P. caeruleus had lower pairing success than control birds, whilst blue tits raised by coal tits P. ater had higher recruitment than controls, or those raised by great tits.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf the wild populations of a species are very small then it may not be possible to foster offspring to conspecifics. However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range."
