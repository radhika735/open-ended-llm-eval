  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing or controlling predators using lethal controls on crocodilian populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredators can drive declines or local extinctions of vulnerable reptile species. Non-native predators may be a particular problem for native reptiles that lack sufficient predator avoidance behaviours. Native predators can also threaten populations of reptiles that persist in low numbers. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproductive success for species of conservation concern.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.\nSee also: Remove or control predators using fencing and/or aerial nets and Remove or control predators by relocating them."
