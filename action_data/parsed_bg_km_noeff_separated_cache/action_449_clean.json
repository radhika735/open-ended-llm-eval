  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated study in South Africa found that a higher percentage of African penguins Spheniscus demersus that were relocated following an oil spill bred at their old colonies, compared to birds which were rehabilitated after being oiled, despite fewer relocated birds being seen at their home colony.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf an oil spill is definitely going to affect a large number of birds and there is sufficient warning, then it may be possible to temporarily relocate birds away from the danger. This avoids having to clean birds, which can be expensive, stressful and may not work (see ‘Clean birds following oil spills’). However, it is still likely to be expensive and carries the risk that birds will not be able to return to the original site. Alternatively, there is the possibility, with fast-flying species, that they will return before the clean-up operations are complete, thus becoming oiled anyway."
