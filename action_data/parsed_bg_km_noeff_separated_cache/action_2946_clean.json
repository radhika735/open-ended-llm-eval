Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nParking lots, shopping centres, housing, industrial facilities or tourist sites are sometimes built on marshes or swamps. Removing such developments could allow marsh or swamp vegetation to recover (e.g. at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in California, USA; Brennan 2017), or provide an opportunity to create new marshes or swamps.\nRelated actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).\nBrennan D.S. (2017) Parking lot becomes salt marsh in Del Mar wetland restoration. Available at https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no-delmar-wetlands-20170713-story.html.
