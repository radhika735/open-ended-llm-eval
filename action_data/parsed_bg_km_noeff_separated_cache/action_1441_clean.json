  "action_title": "Destroy habitat within buffer zones to make them unusable for primates",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of destroying habitat within buffer zones to make them unusable for primate on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves the clearing/destruction of the natural vegetation within buffer zones to render the habitat unusable to primates, thereby buffering adjacent areas of palatable crops against crop-raiding primates.\n            The use of unpalatable buffer crops to deter primates is discussed under ‘Use of unpalatable buffer crops’."
