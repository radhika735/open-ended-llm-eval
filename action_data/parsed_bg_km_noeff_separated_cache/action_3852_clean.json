  "action_id": "3852",
  "action_title": "Minimize road lighting to reduce insect attraction",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIlluminating roads at night is an important part of traffic and pedestrian safety, but poses a risk to moths which are attracted to artificial lights, and therefore disrupted from their natural behaviours such as feeding and reproduction. Minimizing lighting on roads, either by reducing the number or intensity of lights, restricting the timing of lighting, or using motion-sensitive lighting which only activates when required, may help to reduce the impacts on moth populations.\nFor studies on reducing the impacts of lighting generally, see actions under “Threat: Pollution”."
