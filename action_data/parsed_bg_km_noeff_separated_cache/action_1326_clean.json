  "action_title": "Primates: Add gum solutions to drilled hollow feeders",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of adding gum solutions to drilled hollow feeders for primates.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome small primates, such as marmosets, eat gum in the wild by gouging Â in tree branches and eat the gum that accumulates. In captivity we can provide artificial gum in hollow feeders or painted on rough bark., The aim is to encourage foraging behaviour and promote feeding behaviours seen in the wild."
