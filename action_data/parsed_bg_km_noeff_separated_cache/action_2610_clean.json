  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of incentivising species protection through licensed trophy hunting. This study was in Nepal.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A study in Nepal found that after trophy hunting started, bharal abundance increased, though the sex ratio of this species, and of Himalayan tahr, became skewed towards females.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrophy hunting is the hunting of wild animals for recreation. Usually, this involves large or otherwise distinguished animals, such as large carnivores, or species with large antlers. The animal, or part of it, is kept by the hunter, often for display. Trophy hunting may provide financial support to local communities or conservation initiatives, through locally levied fees (Di Minin et al. 2016). This may increase the perceived value of maintaining populations of such species in the long term and may, hence, incentivise greater habitat and species protection in such areas.\nDi Minin E., Leader-Williams N. & Bradshaw C.J.A. (2016) Banning trophy hunting will exacerbate biodiversity loss. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 31, 99–102."
