  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting catch shares by area on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCatch share is a fishery management system that allocates harvest rights to individuals or communities. There are two main types: area- and quota-based catch shares. Area-based systems, known as ‘Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries’, or TURFs (Quynh et al. 2017), allocate participants an exclusive privilege to harvest a specific area, usually with controls on fishing mortality. Setting catch shares by area may limit fishing effort and mortality and help ensure sustainability by reducing effects of overfishing.\nEvidence for related interventions is summarized under ‘Set an overall catch limit (quota cap or total allowable catch) by fishery or fleet’, ‘Introduce catch shares’ and ‘Set catch shares by species‘.\nQuynh C.N.T., Schilizzi S., Hailu A. & Iftekhar S. (2017) Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs): State of the art and the road ahead. Marine Policy, 75, 41–52."
