  "action_id": "3179",
  "action_title": "Remove pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation in marshes or swamps, of removing pollutants from waste gases before releasing them into the environment.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAtmospheric pollutants can be removed from waste gases (e.g. from industry or transport) before they enter the environment. Physical or electrostatic filters can trap dust and ash particles. Sulfur dioxide can be removed by spraying alkaline substances, such as seawater, into waste gases. Reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants may prevent damage to marsh or swamp vegetation, or allow it to recover. Ultimately, efforts to clean up waste gases may be driven by legislation or financial incentives.\nRelated actions: Clean waste water before it enters the environment."
