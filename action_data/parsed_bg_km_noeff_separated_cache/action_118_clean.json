  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in the margins of three arable fields      resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species. The number of aphid predators on a natural patch of      nettles was higher than on crops, however there were fewer predators on      nettle strips than on crops. Three insect families, including green      lacewings, were only found on nettles.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nIn agricultural landscapes, field margins can provide valuable habitats for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. The common nettle Urtica dioica is a perennial species that provides food for a range of insects (Greig-Smith 1948), including ‘beneficial’ species that help to suppress pests. This intervention involves planting nettle strips which may enhance invertebrate diversity on arable fields.\nGreig-Smith P.W. (1948) Biological flora of the British Isles. Journal of Ecology, 36, 343-351."
