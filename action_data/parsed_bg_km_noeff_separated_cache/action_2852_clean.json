  "action_title": "Use biological control to manage invasive or problematic species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biological control to manage invasive or problematic species on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBiological control may be used to reduce the population of invasive or problematic species, such as those that form harmful algal blooms (e.g. Nagasaki et al. 1999). This may involve releasing native or non-native predators, parasites or diseases that are likely to affect specific invasive or other problematic species. However, there are risks involved and the use of native species as biological control should be prioritised over non-native species (Secord 2003).\nNagasaki K., Tarutani K. & Yamaguchi M. (1999) Growth characteristics of Heterosigma akashiwo virus and its possible use as a microbiological agent for red tide control. Applied and environmental microbiology, 65, 898–902.\nSecord D. (2003) Biological control of marine invasive species: cautionary tales and land-based lessons. Biological Invasions, 5, 117–131."
