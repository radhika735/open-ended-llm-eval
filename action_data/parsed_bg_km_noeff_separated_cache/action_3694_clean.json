  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using chemical deterrents on reptile populations. Two studies were in the USA and one was in each of Spain and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (4 studies): Three of four controlled studies (including three replicated studies) in Spain, the USA and Australia found that a similar number of artificial Hermannâ€™s tortoise nests, diamondback terrapin nests and loggerhead turtle nests that had chemical deterrents, pepper powder or chilli powder applied were predated compared to nests with no deterrent. The other study found that fewer loggerhead turtle nets that had habanero pepper powder applied to the surface were predated than nests with no pepper powder, or nest with pepper powder below the surface.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVarious chemicals may be used to deter predators from excavating reptile nests in search of eggs. If successful, such deterrents could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators."
