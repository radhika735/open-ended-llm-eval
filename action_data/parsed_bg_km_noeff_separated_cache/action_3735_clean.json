  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of temporarily moving reptiles away from short-term threats on their populations. One study was in France and one was in Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that after temporarily relocating Hermann’s tortoises during vegetation management, a similar number were observed compared to before management began.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in France found that at least 25% of temporarily relocated and released Hermann’s tortoises survived for 4–5 years after re-release. The study also found that 5% of individuals died while in temporary captivity.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome threats to reptile habitat may be planned and take place over set time periods. This could include, for example, construction works or habitat management activities such as brush cutting which may injure or kill reptiles. In these circumstances it may be desirable to temporarily remove individuals and hold them in captivity while the planned works are carried out and then release the same animals back into their original environment.\nFor studies on the effect of permanently moving reptiles away from threats, see Translocate reptiles away from threats."
