  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining wildlife corridors in residential areas. This study was in Botswana.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated study in Botswana found that retained wildlife corridors in residential areas were used by 19 mammal species, including African elephants.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nResidential and commercial developments can fragment home ranges of mammal species, making access to some resources difficult or dangerous. Retention of wildlife corridors, such as undeveloped land, riversides, woodland strips or other habitat through which mammals can pass, may help to reduce or mitigate some of these impacts of development."
