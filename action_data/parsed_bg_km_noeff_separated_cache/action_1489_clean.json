  "action_id": "1489",
  "action_title": "Leave hollow trees in areas of selective logging for sleeping sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of leaving hollow trees in areas on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral primate species, such as lemurs and lorises (Strepsirrhini), may seek shelter at night and/or during the day in tree hollows. It is therefore believed that leaving hollow trees in areas of selective logging will promote the survival of these species."
