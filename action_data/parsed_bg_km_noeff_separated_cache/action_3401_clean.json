  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of sowing seeds of nurse plants on grassland vegetation. The study was in France.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants reduced the similarity of the plant community to that of nearby intact steppe compared to areas where no seeds were sown.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants did not change plant species richness and richness was lower than in nearby intact steppe.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in France found that sowing seeds of nurse plants did not change vegetation cover compared to areas where no seeds were sown.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNurse plants are plants which are thought to aid the growth of other species by providing relatively benign conditions below their canopy. Examples of these altered conditions may include increases in moisture and nutrients, and decreases in temperature and damage from herbivores (de Toledo Castanho & Prado 2014). Sowing the seeds of nurse plants may facilitate the colonisation of grassland species.\nThis action involves sowing the seeds of nurse plants only. For studies that sow or plant both nurse plants and grassland plant species, see ‘Sow or plant nurse plants (alongside seeding/planting of grassland species)’.\nde Toledo Castanho, C. & Prado, P.I. (2014) Benefit of shading by nurse plant does not change along a stress gradient in a coastal dune. PLOS ONE, 9, e105082."
