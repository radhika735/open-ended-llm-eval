  "action_id": "2747",
  "action_title": "Modify design of underwater turbines",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying the design of underwater turbines on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere is the potential for marine and freshwater mammals to collide with renewable energy devices, such as underwater turbines (Wilson et al. 2006). Turbines may be modified to reduce the risk of mammal injury or death during a collision, for example, sharp edges could be reduced, or blades shielded. Using certain colours or lighting for underwater turbines may also increase their visibility to mammals.\nWilson, B. Batty, R. S., Daunt, F. & Carter, C. (2006) Collision risks between marine renewable energy devices and mammals, fish and diving birds. Report to the Scottish Executive. Scottish Association for Marine Science, Oban."
