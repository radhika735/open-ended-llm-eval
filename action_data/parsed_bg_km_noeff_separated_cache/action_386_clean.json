A before-and-after study found higher survival of captive-bred brown teal Anas chlorotis following feral cat Felis catus control.\nOne meta-analysis from the USA and Canada found that ducks on sites with mammalian predator removal did not have higher reproductive success and trends in reproductive success were no more positive than on sites without predator control.",
