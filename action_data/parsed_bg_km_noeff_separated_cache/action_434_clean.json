  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from across the world investigating a range of taxa and parasites found that birds had higher productivity or survival if either chicks or adults were treated for endoparasites.\nOne small study from Spain found no effect of Staphylococcus aureus treatment on eagle survival, while a study from Mauritius found uncertain evidence as to whether trichomoniasis treatment increased survival of pink pigeons Nesoenas mayeri after fledging.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled trial from the Netherlands found lower parasite burdens but also lower survival in Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus chicks treated with anthelmintic drugs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDiseases such as such as trichomoniasis or bird pox can have severe impacts on bird populations in areas where they are not native and where birds do not have immunity, but native diseases can also be important limiting factors for populations."
