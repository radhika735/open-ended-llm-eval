  "action_title": "American bullfrog control: Draining ponds and altering the length of time for which the pond contains water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effects of draining ponds or altering the length of time for which ponds contain water on the control of American bullfrogs.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBreeding bullfrog populations have been found to disappear following natural pond drying (Maret et al. 2006).  Therefore, draining invaded waterbodies may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of American bullfrogs, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed (Maret et al. 2006).  It is also possible to prevent bullfrog larvae from completing metamorphosis by selective draining to reduce the length of time for which the pond contains water (Govindarajulu 2004).\nMaret T.
