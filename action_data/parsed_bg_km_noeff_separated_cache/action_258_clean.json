  "action_title": "Paint wind turbines to increase their visibility",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single  ex situ experiment found that thick black stripes running across a wind turbineâ€™s blades made them more conspicuous to an American kestrel than control (unpatterned) blades, but that other designs were less visible, or indistinguishable from controls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWind turbines can have a detrimental impact on birds both through direct collisions with the blades or because the vortices created force birds to the ground. Direct collisions may be reduced if birds can clearly see and avoid blades."
