Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRemoving urban areas, industrial facilities or tourist sites that have been built on or near peatlands could allow the vegetation to recover.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: rewetting, because peatlands are often drained to allow development or are dried out by drainage of sites nearby; habitat creation and restoration interventions for formerly developed land."
