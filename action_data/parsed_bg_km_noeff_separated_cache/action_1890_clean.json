  "action_title": "Amphibians: Leave infertile eggs at spawn site as food for egg-eating larvae",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of leaving infertile eggs at spawn site as food for egg-eating larvae.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome species of amphibian feed on infertile eggs in their first weeks of life at the spawn site. This behavior can only occur in captivity if unfertilized eggs are left in the enclosure. By mimicking a diet tadpoles may experience in the wild, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided."
