  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using tree tubes, small fences or cages to protect individual trees from mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nA range of mammals, including rodents and ungulates, can cause substantial damage to trees, especially young trees, through browsing activities on foliage and by stripping bark from trees. As well as damage to natural habitats, this can cause financial losses to the forestry industry (Huitu et al. 2009). In an attempt to reduce such conflict, trees may be protected from attack using a range of barriers to prevent mammals from accessing them. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control on these mammals.\nHuitu O., Kiljunen N., Korpimäki E., Koskela E., Mappes T., Pietiäinen H., Pöysä H. & Henttonen H.
