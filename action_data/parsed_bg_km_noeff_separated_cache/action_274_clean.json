  "action_title": "Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce persecution or exploitation of species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive out of six studies from across the world found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes. In all but one case, education was one of several interventions employed. \nA replicated before-and-after study from Canada also found that there was a significant shift in local peoples’ attitudes to conservation and exploited species following educational programmes.\nOne study from Venezuela found no evidence for decreases in yellow-shouldered parrot Amazona barbadensis poaching following an educational programme in local schools. The authors argue that the benefits would probably be seen later in the project.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf a community relies on exploiting bird populations then they may well want to exploit the population sustainably, to ensure it persists and can be exploited in the future. However, exactly how to exploit a population sustainably may not be clear, and so education programmes may be useful in reducing over-exploitation.\nOther, more general education programmes are discussed in ‘Education and community development’."
