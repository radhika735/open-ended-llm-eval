  "action_title": "Create mounds or hollows (before planting)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of creating peat mounds or hollows before planting peatland plants. Two studies were in bogs. One was in a tropical peat swamp.\nGrowth (1 study): One controlled study in a peat swamp in Thailand reported that trees planted into mounds of peat grew thicker stems than trees planted at ground level.\nCover (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in bogs in Canada found that roughening the peat surface (by harrowing, ploughing, creating vehicle tracks or adding peat blocks) did not significantly affect cover of planted Sphagnum moss after 1–3 growing seasons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVegetation may struggle to colonize flat bare peat. It can be damaged by extreme heat, sunlight, strong winds or prolonged flooding. In temperate peatlands, roughening the peat surface (e.g. by ploughing, creating vehicle tracks, or adding peat blocks) could create lower sheltered, moist and shaded habitats that are more suitable for plant growth. These processes can also break up any hard crust or compress loose, dry peat. Although raised areas might be less suitable for peatland vegetation initially, the idea is that peatland vegetation can spread from the depressions once they have been colonized. In tropical peatlands, planting trees into mounds might improve their survival by reducing the duration of flooding and increasing oxygen supply to the roots (Wibisono et al. 2005). Mounds may naturally form in peat swamp forests from the roots of fallen trees.   \nCaution: Manipulating the peat surface may damage its physical structure. Repeated use of vehicles on soft, wet peat may be particularly damaging.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: roughen peat surface without introducing vegetation; large scale reprofiling/relandscaping before planting.\nWibisono I.T.C., Siboro L. & Suryadiputra I.N.N.
