  "action_title": "Strip turf to control grass",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in the UK found that cutting and removing turf increased the number of heathland plants. The same study found that the presence of a small number of heathland plants increased, and that the presence of a small number of non-heathland plants decreased.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the UK found that presence of heather was similar in areas where turf was cut and areas that were mown or rotovated.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the UK found that the presence of wavy hair grass was similar in areas where turf was cut and those that were mown or rotovated.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTurf was traditionally stripped so that it could be used as fuel. However, reduction in the use of this technique is thought to have resulted in an increase in grass species in some shrublands (Bokdam and Gleichman 2000). Reintroducing turf cutting may help to reduce the abundance of problematic grass species.\nBokdam, J. & Gleichman, J.M.
