  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of providing artificial shelters on subtidal benthic invertebrates. Three studies were in the Caribbean Sea (Mexico); one in Florida Bay and one in the Florida Keys (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nLobster abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies in the Caribbean Sea found that abundance of lobsters either increased in plots with artificial shelters but not in plots without, or increased in all plots but more so in plots with artificial shelters than those without.\nLobster condition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Caribbean Sea found that lobsters in plots with artificial shelters were bigger than in plots without.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nUse (3 studies): Three replicated studies (two controlled) in Florida Bay, the Florida Keys, and the Caribbean Sea, found that artificial shelters were occupied by lobsters and molluscs, that occupancy by lobsters varied with artificial shelter designs, that lobsters occupied artificial shelters more than natural ones (crevices), and that lobsters occupying artificial shelters were larger, had greater nutritional condition, and had similar sex ratio and survival rate, compared to lobsters occupying natural shelters.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, such as habitat loss (Airoldi et al. 2008). To improve animals’ survival or recolonization success, some assistance can be provided in the form of artificial shelters that mimic the natural shelters usually found in the marine environment, such as ‘casitas’ used for lobsters (Gutzler et al. 2015). These shelters can provide refugia and potentially help animals avoid predation (Arce et al. 1997).\n \nAiroldi L., Balata D. & Beck M.W.
