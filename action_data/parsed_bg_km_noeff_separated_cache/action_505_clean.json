  "action_title": "Remove vegetation to create nesting areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo out of six studies found that the number of waders and terns nesting in an area increased following the removal of vegetation, and another found that a tern colony moved to an area prepared by removing vegetation. Two of these studies used multiple interventions at once. One study found a decrease in colony size after several interventions, including vegetation control.\nA study from the UK found that gulls and terns nested in an area cleared of vegetation and a controlled study from Puerto Rico found that although no terns nested in plots cleared completely of vegetation, more nested in partially-cleared plots than in uncleared plots.\nA before-and-after study from Canada found that tern nesting success was higher after plots were cleared of vegetation and other interventions were used.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany birds nest on bare substrate or in areas of sparse vegetation and may abandon a site if it becomes overgrown. Removing vegetation may therefore help to maintain a breeding colony, or attract birds to a new area.\nThis intervention describes the general removal of vegetation, studies discussing the removal of specific species are described in ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species - Remove problematic vegetation’."
