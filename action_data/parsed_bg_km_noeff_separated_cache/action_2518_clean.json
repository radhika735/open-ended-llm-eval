  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of providing live natural prey to captive mammals to foster hunting behaviour before release. One study was in Spain, one was in the USA and one was in Botswana.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): Two studies in Spain and Botswana found that a rehabilitated Iberian lynx and wild-born but captive-reared orphaned cheetahs and leopards that were provided with live natural prey in captivity survived for between at least three months and 19 months after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A controlled study in the USA found that captive-bred black-footed ferrets fed on live prairie dogs took longer to disperse after release but showed greater subsequent movements than did ferrets not fed with live prairie dogs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredatory mammals held in captivity, either for rearing prior to release or for rehabilitation following injury or illness, may lose or not fully develop natural hunting abilities. This may reduce their chance of survival after release. Providing live prey to such animals in captivity may help them to retain or develop essential hunting skills."
