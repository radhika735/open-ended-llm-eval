  "action_title": "Floating pennywort: Biological control using fungal-based herbicides",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on biological control of floating pennywort using fungal-based herbicides.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nApplication of a mass-produced, formulated product made of microorganisms can potentially be used as a means of controlling invasive plants (Gassmann et al. 2006).Â  The US National Fungus Collections Database lists the fungal microorganisms found associated with floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, which include Cercospora hydrocotyles, Entyloma fimbriatum, Entyloma hydrocotyles, Physoderma hydrocotylidis and Puccinia hydrocotyles (Farr & Rossman 2011).\nFarr, D.
