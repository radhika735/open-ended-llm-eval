  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing wildlife exclusion grates or cattle grids. All three studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (3 studies): Two of three studies (including two replicated, before-and-after studies), in the USA, found that steel grates largely prevented crossings by deer whilst two found that they did not prevent crossings by deer and elk or black bears. In one of the studies, only one of three designs prevented crossings.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWildlife exclusion grates or cattle grids are designed to discourage wildlife, particularly ungulates, from walking through a gap in a fence where an access road approaches a larger road with higher traffic volume and vehicle speeds for example. If effective, they could reduce animal mortality and also collision-related risks for motorists.\nSee also: Agriculture & Aquaculture - Install metal grids at field entrances to prevent mammals entering to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
