  "action_id": "1493",
  "action_title": "Avoid slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of avoiding slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClimbers, lianas, hemi-epiphytic figs Ficus spp.  and ground vegetation represent important food sources to many primate species. As lianas physically link trees together, they also provide canopy-to-canopy access for many arboreal primates. This intervention aims to prevent cutting or damaging of these plants during selective logging activities in the hope that this will also promote primate conservation. \n            The avoidance of important primate food tree species during selective logging operations is discussed under ‘Avoid/minimize logging of important food tree species for primates’."
