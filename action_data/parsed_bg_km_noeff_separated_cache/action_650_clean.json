  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small unreplicated trial of heather moorland restoration in northern England found that mowing and flail cutting along with grazing could be used to control the dominance of purple moor grass. The same study found moorland restoration benefited one bird species, with one or two pairs of northern lapwing found to breed in the area of restored moorland, where none had bred prior to restoration.\nA review from the UK concluded that vegetation changes took place very slowly following the removal of grazing to restore upland grassland to heather moorland.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nUpland heath/moorland typically consists of dwarf shrubs such as heather Calluna vulgaris (Natural England 2011). These areas are important for wildlife including rare birds such as black grouse Tetrao tetrix, as well as invertebrates (Natural England 2011). Moorland can become dominated by scrub or grasses such as purple moor grass Molinia caerulea (Natural England 2011). This intervention involves restoring or creating areas of upland heath/moorland which may benefit birds and other wildlife.\nSee also ‘Manage heather by swiping to simulate burning’ and ‘Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning’ for studies that investigated specific techniques for managing heather.\nNatural England (2011) Upland heath.
