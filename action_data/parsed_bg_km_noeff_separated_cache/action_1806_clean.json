  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of excavating pools (without planting) on peatland vegetation. Both studies were based on the same experimental set-up in bogs in Canada.\nPlant community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that excavated pools were colonized by peatland vegetation over 4–6 years, but contained different plant communities to natural pools. In particular, cattail was more common in created pools.\nVegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that after four years, created pools had less cover than natural pools of Sphagnum moss, herbs and shrubs.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in bogs in Canada reported that after six years, created pools contained a similar number of plant species to natural pools.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeatlands may contain permanent pools which contribute to habitat diversity. However, these pools can be lost following drainage, peat harvesting or drought (Beadle et al. 2015). Pools may also be filled in naturally as vegetation develops and peat accumulates, so they may need to be re-excavated to maintain certain communities (van Diggelen et al. 1996). This section considers excavating pools in peatlands, then leaving vegetation to naturally recolonize.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: rewetting, which may need to be done to fill created pools; introduce peatland vegetation, including introductions into created pools i.e. planting mosses, planting herbs, spreading moss fragments or spreading mixed vegetation fragments.\nBeadle J.M., Brown L.E. & Holden J.
