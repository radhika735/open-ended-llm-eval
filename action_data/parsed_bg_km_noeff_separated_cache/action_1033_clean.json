  "action_title": "<i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Removal of food source",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effect of removing food sources as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCrayfish are omnivores. Removing food items from their environment has the potential to reduce growth rates and survival and could lead to mortality. A replicated field study from California, USA (Pintor & Sih 2011), found that availability of prey, coupled with high levels of stream discharge limited the distribution of signal crayfish Pacifasticus lenuisculus at transect and stream scales, respectively.  A national study from the Czech Republic (Svobodová et al. 2012) found that invasive spiny-cheek crayfish Oronectes limosus were more commonly found in nutrient-enriched water while native species preferred water of a higher quality.  In addition, a replicated study in Japan (Kobayashi et al. 2011) identified that abundant leaf litter content in ponds led to higher densities of red swamp crayfish, due to them using it as a food source. It suggested restricting leaf litter within ponds would reduce crayfish population sizes.\nPintor L.M. & Sih A.
