  "action_title": "Floating pennywort: Biological control using native herbivores",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on biological control of floating pennywort using native herbivores.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIncreasing the numbers of a native species, normally an arthropod, can increase the level of foraging to levels higher than normally endured by the target (Gassmann et al. 2006).Â  This can potentially be used as a means of controlling invasive plants.\nGassmann A., Cock M.J.W., Shaw R. & Evans H.C. (2006) The potential for biological control of invasive alien aquatic weeds in Europe: a review. Hydrobiologia, 570, 217-222."
