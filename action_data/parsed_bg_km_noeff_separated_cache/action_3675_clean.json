  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of removing or controlling predators using lethal controls on tuatara populations. This study was in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in New Zealand found that after eradicating Pacific rats the abundance of tuatara was higher on islands where rats were eradicated than on islands where some rats remained, and that the percentage of total tuatara that were juveniles increased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredators can drive declines or local extinctions of vulnerable reptile species. Non-native predators may be a particular problem for native reptiles that lack sufficient predator avoidance behaviours. Native predators can also threaten populations of reptiles that persist in low numbers. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproductive success for species of conservation concern.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.\nSee also: Remove or control predators using fencing and/or aerial nets and Remove or control predators by relocating them."
