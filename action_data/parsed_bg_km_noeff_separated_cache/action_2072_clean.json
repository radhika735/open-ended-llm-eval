  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting limits for change in sediment particle size during aggregate extraction on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes. During aggregate extraction, the unwanted part of the sediment is discarded back into the water or onto the seabed. Consequently, changes occur to the size of sediment particles, which can alter the natural seabed and the invertebrates living on or inside it (De Groot 1996). Limits for acceptable change in particle size during aggregate extraction can be set, with the aim of reducing the amount of alteration to seabed sediment properties. This may facilitate recovery following cessation of activities post-extraction (Cooper 2013). Additional evidence for intervention related to sediment discard during aggregate extraction and other activities are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Limit, cease, or prohibit sediment discard during aggregate extraction”, “Remove discarded sediment material from the seabed following cessation of aggregate extraction”, and “Set limits for change in sediment particle size during rock dump”.\n \nCooper K.M.
