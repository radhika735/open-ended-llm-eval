  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of diverting shipping routes on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDiverting shipping routes away from important areas for marine and freshwater mammals may reduce the risk of lethal collisions (Vanderlaan et al. 2009, van der Hoop et al. 2012, Chion et al. 2018). Diversions may be permanent or temporary (e.g. seasonal or in response to mammal sightings), mandatory or voluntary, and may apply to all vessels or to certain vessel types or sizes. Careful planning may be required as diverting shipping routes to avoid one species could increase the collision risk for other species in new areas (Redfern et al. 2013). Enforcement may also be required if compliance is low.\nThis intervention is often combined with vessel speed restrictions, see Set and enforce vessel speed limits.\nChion C., Turgeon S., Cantin G., Michaud R., Ménard N., Lesage V., Parrott L., Beaufils P., Clermont Y. & Gravel C.
