  "action_title": "Restrict use of rodent poisons on farmland with high secondary poisoning risk",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of restricting use of rodent poisons on farmland that have secondary poisoning risks.\n\n‘We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRodenticides are in common use around farms, houses and industrial sites. The most frequently used forms are anticoagulant rodenticides, which cause death in target animals by inhibiting blood clotting. Death can take several days after ingestion so poisoning may be passed on up the food chain both to predators and to scavengers. In some situations, a high proportion of predators may be exposed to secondary poisoning. For example, in one study 85% of fisher Pekania pennanti carcasses collected showed signs of exposure (Thompson et al. 2013) whilst another showed signs of exposure in 79% of invasive American Mink, with the risk of exposure being higher in areas with farms (Ruiz-Suárez et al. 2016). Restricting use of such poisons may reduce their ingestion by mammalian carnivores.\nThompson C., Sweitzer R., Gabriel M., Purcell K., Barrett R. & Poppenga R.
