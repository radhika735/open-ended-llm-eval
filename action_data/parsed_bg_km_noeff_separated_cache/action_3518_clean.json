  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of creating uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields on reptile populations. One study was in Australia and one was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that revegetated linear strips had similar reptile species richness compared to cleared and remnant strips. The study also found that revegetated strips and patches had similar reptile species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that revegetated linear strips had similar reptile abundance compared to cleared and remnant strips. The study also found that revegetated strips and patches had similar reptile abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in the UK found that uncultivated field margins were used by slow worms, common lizards and grass snakes, but not by adders.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCreating margins around agricultural fields may provide important habitat for a range of reptile species. This intervention includes both cases where field margin vegetation is allowed to regenerate naturally, as well as cases where margins are planted/sown with desirable plant species.\nThis action does not cover hedgerows, which are included in Provide or maintain hedgerows on farmland. See also Provide or retain set-aside areas on farmland.\nFor studies on the effect of different actions for managing existing vegetation, see Raise mowing height; Habitat restoration and creation – Manage vegetation using herbicides; Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing; Manage vegetation by hand and Manage vegetation using livestock grazing."
