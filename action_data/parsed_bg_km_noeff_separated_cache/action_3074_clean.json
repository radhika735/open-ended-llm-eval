  "action_title": "Change season/timing of prescribed burning: freshwater marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of burning freshwater marshes in different seasons or at different times. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater plant species richness than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that spring-burned plots had greater overall vegetation cover than summer-burned plots, at the end of the growing season.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the cover and frequency of some individual plant species responded differently to spring vs summer burning.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed burning could have different effects on vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid disturbance when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the community. The season of disturbance can also affect nutrient levels and impacts to soils by trampling or vehicles.\nTo be summarized as evidence in this section, studies should have compared a fixed frequency and intensity of burning, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of marsh burned every summer vs 100% of marsh burned every other summer).\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Reduce intensity of prescribed burning; Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance; Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants."
