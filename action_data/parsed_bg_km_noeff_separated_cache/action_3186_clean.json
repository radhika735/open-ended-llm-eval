  "action_title": "Restore/create freshwater marshes  in areas that will be climatically suitable in the future",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restoring or creating freshwater marshes in areas expected to be climatically suitable in the future.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIt may be wise to prioritize restoration or creation of marshes in areas that will remain – or become more – climatically suitable in the future, rather than areas that are destined to become unsuitable. These areas will provide space for existing vegetation to move into as their current sites become to dry, wet, warm or cold (Oliver et al. 2012).\nOliver T.H., Smithers R.J., Bailey S., Walmsley C.A. & Watts K. (2012) A decision framework for considering climate change adaptation in biodiversity conservation planning. Journal of Applied Ecology, 49, 1247–1255."
