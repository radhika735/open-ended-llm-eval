  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNineteen individual studies looked at the effect of uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on wildlife. Seventeen studies from the UK and northwest Europe (six reviews and seven replicated studies of which two were site comparisons, one a before-and-after trial and one was controlled and randomized) found that leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland provides benefits to some or all target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates, and mammals. These wildlife benefits included increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, species richness and abundance of spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success and the establishment, abundance or species richness of rare arable plant species. A replicated study found northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail bred in lapwing plots.\nTwo studies (a replicated study and a review) from the UK found that leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots on farmland had no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles. A replicated site comparison study in the UK found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots for ground-nesting birds in two out of three regions. One review from the UK found evidence that pernicious weeds were more commonly found on uncropped cultivated margins than conservation or conventional headlands. A replicated site comparison from the UK found the proportion of young grey partridges in the population was lower in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention can be introduced for ground-nesting birds (sometimes called ‘lapwing plots’), rare arable plants, or both. It may also provide habitat for insects and foraging sites for mammals and seed- and insect-eating birds (Campaign for the Farmed Environment 2011).\nPlots or strips are cultivated, but left undrilled. For ground-nesting birds, the plots are usually at least 2 ha in size. They are different from 'skylark plots', which are much smaller and usually created in groups. If this measure is taken in field margins (6 m strips at the edge of arable fields), no fertilizer is applied, and herbicide applications are minimal, with only spot treatment of particular weeds permitted.\nSee also ‘Provide (or retain) set-aside areas’, for rotational or long-term fallow land at the field scale not cultivated or implemented specifically for ground-nesting birds.\nSee also ‘Sow rare or declining arable weeds’ for a study of different management options that could also apply to uncropped, cultivated margins.\nCampaign for the Farmed Environment (2011) Guide to voluntary measures 2011 edition.
