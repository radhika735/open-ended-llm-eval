  "action_title": "Change season/timing of prescribed burning: freshwater swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of burning freshwater swamps in different seasons or at different times.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed burning could have different effects on vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid disturbance when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the community. The season of disturbance can also affect nutrient levels and impacts to soils by trampling or vehicles.\nTo be summarized as evidence in this section, studies should have compared a fixed frequency and intensity of burning, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of marsh burned every summer vs 100% of marsh burned every other summer).\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Reduce intensity of prescribed burning; Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance; Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants."
