  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using repellents that smell bad (‘area repellents’) to deter crop or property damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in the UK.\n\nKEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that a repellent reduced use of treated areas by moles.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention covers use of manufactured repellents that emit a smell that is designed to repel animals from areas of crops or other property that is vulnerable to damage. If such repellents can prevent or reduce crop or property damage by wild mammals, this could reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of these animals.\nSee also: Use predator scent to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Use pheromones to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
