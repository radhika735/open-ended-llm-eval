  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of promoting careful bat-related eco-tourism to improve behaviour towards bats.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEco-tourism may help to promote bat conservation and raise funds for conservation and research. However, it requires careful implementation as large-scale or unregulated eco-tourism can cause considerable disturbance to bats (e.g. Biswas et al. 2011).\nBiswas J., Shrotriya S., Rajput J. & Sasmal S. (2011) Impacts of ecotourism on bat habitats in caves of Kanger Valley National Park, India. Research Journal of Environmental Sciences, 5, 752–762."
