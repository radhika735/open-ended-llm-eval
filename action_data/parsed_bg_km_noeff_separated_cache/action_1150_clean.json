  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, site comparison study in Ethiopia found that the risk of deforestation was lower in certified than uncertified forests. One controlled, before-and-after trial in Gabon found that when logging intensity was taken into account although tree damage did not differ, changes in above-ground biomass were smaller in certified than in uncertified forests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nForest certification is a market-based mechanism that tries to ensure sustainable wood harvesting. Well-known examples are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). To receive certification, forests need to be managed according to a pre-agreed set of standards to ensure their sustainability (standards may vary depending on the type of certification). Certification allows foresters to identify themselves as sustainable producers and add a price premium to their products. This could make their business more profitable possibly encouraging other foresters to adopt certification and potentially benefiting biodiversity."
