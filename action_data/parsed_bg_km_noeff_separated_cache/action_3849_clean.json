Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeople can deliberately or unintentionally damage important habitats by straying from footpaths in sensitive areas, allowing animals such as dogs to roam freely, or by driving vehicles off-road. Introducing signs or imposing access restrictions may reduce unintentional, careless actions, as well as discouraging deliberate acts of vandalism by indicating that a site is being monitored."
