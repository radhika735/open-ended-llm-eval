  "action_title": "Water primrose: Flame treatment",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was found for use of flame treatment to control water primrose.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFlame treatment may provide an effective treatment for controlling water primrose Ludwigia spp. especially when growing on soil, and particularly when used as the plants emerge from the embankments or as an after treatment after a rigorous removal has taken place.  It has been reported that dead water primrose stands can be removed by burning (Chandrasena et al. 2002).  In addition, a controlled, replicated pilot experiment on a different invasive plant, floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative, and progressive impact and a 3 second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal (Joost van der Burg &  Michielsen 2010).\nChandrasena, N., Pinto, L. & Sim, R.
