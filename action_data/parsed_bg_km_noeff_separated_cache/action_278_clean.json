  "action_title": "Use wildlife refuges to reduce hunting disturbance",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from the USA and Europe found that bird densities were higher in refuges where hunting was prohibited, compared to areas with hunting. In addition, two studies found that more birds used hunting-free areas during the open season and on hunting days.\nNo studies investigated the population-level impacts of these refuges.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWildlife refuges are a type of protected area where hunting is prohibited. Often situated near hunting areas, they can be effective both by reducing the number of birds shot, but also in reducing the disturbance to non-target species. Other interventions designed to reduce disturbance are discussed in ‘Threat: Disturbance’."
