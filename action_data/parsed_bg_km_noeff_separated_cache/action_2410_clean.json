  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing mammal crossing points along fences on farmland. Two studies were in Namibia and one each was in the USA and the UK.\n\nKEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): A study in the USA found that pronghorn antelopes crossed a modified cattle grid which prevented escape of domestic sheep and cows. A controlled, before-and-after study in Namibia found installing swing gates through game fencing reduced the digging of holes by animals under the fence, whilst preventing large predator entry. A study in the UK found that a vertical-sided ditch under an electric fence allowed access by otters. A before-and-after study in Namibia found that tyres installed as crossings through fences were used by wild mammals and reduced fence maintenance requirements.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFences erected to retain domestic livestock or, in some cases, exclude wild herbivores or carnivores may also act as a barrier to non-target species. Crossings may be installed to retain habitat connectivity for specific species. Crossing designs vary between different situations depending on the nature of the original fence and the species being targeted for continued access.\n \nFor wildlife-permeable fencing (as opposed to specific crossing points) see Use livestock fences that are permeable to wildlife."
