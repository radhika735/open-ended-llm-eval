  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of creating beetle banks on farmland. This study was in the UK.\n\nKEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated study in the UK found that beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than did field margins.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBeetle banks are raised strips which run through a field, typically planted with grasses. They primarily serve as an overwintering habitat for beetles, which provide pest control in the spring. By dividing the field, beetle banks reduce the distance that predators have to travel to reach the centre of the crop, a potential problem if overwintering habitat occurs only at the field edge. Beetle banks may also harbour other wildlife, such as small mammals."
