  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of sterilizing non-native domestic or feral species (e.g. cats and dogs).\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDomestic animals may present a range of problems for wild mammals. These can include predation (e.g. Woods et al. 2013), disease transmission and hybridization between closely related species (Nussberger et al. 2014). Culling (especially feral animals) may be an option for reducing these threats but can be controversial on animal rights or animal welfare grounds. Sterilizing such animals is an alternative strategy that may reduce impacts of non-native species in the longer term and may also be possible to achieve on a large scale among domestic animals, by liaising with their owners.\nWoods M., Mcdonald R. & Harris S.
