  "action_title": "Use lower profile gillnets with longer/no tie-downs",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using lower profile gillnets with longer/no tie-downs.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGillnets hang in the water at various depths and may entangle reptiles. Tie-downs are lines that are shorter than the height of the net and connect the floatline (top) and leadline (bottom), causing the net to billow out, potentially increasing the chance of entanglement. Lower profile (narrower) nets without tie-downs may reduce the number of reptiles that become entangled."
