  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using ‘bioremediating’ organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome sources of pollution can be biologically ‘remediated’ by transplanting or translocating particular organisms (e.g. algae, bacteria and fungi) to the affected area (e.g. Sode et al. 2013, Xue et al. 2015). These ‘bioremediating’ organisms can naturally remove or neutralize pollutants and improve water quality. Transplanting or translocating such organisms to an affected area may reduce pollution levels and potential harm to reptiles.\nSode S., Bruhn A., Balsby T.J.S., Larsen M.M., Gotfredsen A. & Rasmussen M.B. (2013) Bioremediation of reject water from anaerobically digested waste water sludge with macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Chlorophyta). Bioresource Technology, 146, 426–435.\nXue J., Yu Y., Bai Y., Wang L. & Wu Y.
