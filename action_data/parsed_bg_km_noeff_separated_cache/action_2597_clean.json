  "action_title": "Prohibit or restrict hunting of a species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects of prohibiting or restricting hunting of a mammal species. One study each was in Norway, the USA, South Africa, Poland and Zimbabwe.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): Two studies (including one before-and-after study), in the USA and Poland, found that prohibiting hunting led to population increases of tule elk and wolves.\nSurvival (3 studies): A before-and-after study in Norway found that restricting or prohibiting hunting did not alter the number of brown bears killed. A study in Zimbabwe reported that banning the hunting, possession and trade of Temminck’s ground pangolins did not eliminate hunting of the species. A before-and-after study in South Africa found that increasing legal protection of leopards, along with reducing human-leopard conflict by promoting improved animal husbandry, was associated with increased survival.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHunting may in some cases lead to reductions or local extinctions of mammal species. This intervention covers prohibiting or restricting hunting specifically where hunting is the major threat to a population of a species. For legal protection aimed at other threats see Habitat protection - Legally protect habitat for mammals."
