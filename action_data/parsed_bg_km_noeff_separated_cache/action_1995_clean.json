  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of minimizing noise levels within caves on bat populations. The study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One controlled study in the USA found that experimental cave tours with groups that did not talk resulted in fewer bat flights than when groups did talk, but talking did not have an effect on the number of bat movements.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNoise may disturb bats within caves, causing arousal during hibernation or roost abandonment. Noise levels may be minimised by restricting the number or timing of tourist visits or by asking tourists to remain quiet during tours. See also ‘Impose restrictions on cave visits’."
