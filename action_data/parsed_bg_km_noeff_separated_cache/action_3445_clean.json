  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating large ridges or ledges on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures.\n\nThis means we did not find any studies that directly evaluated this intervention during our literature searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Large ridges and ledges’ are elevations with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 that protrude &gt;50 mm from the substratum (modified from “Large elevations” in Strain et al. 2018). On vertical surfaces, vertically-orientated elevations that fit these criteria are referred to as ‘ridges’, while horizontal ones are referred to as ‘ledges’. On horizontal surfaces, these features are referred to as ‘ridges’ regardless of their orientation.\nLarge ridges and ledges create vertical or horizontal (i.e. overhangs) relief in subtidal rocky habitats. They can provide organisms refuge from predation (Meese & Lowe 2020) and have positive effects on fish populations (Morris et al. 2018). Some species preferentially recruit to habitats with high vertical or horizontal relief (Andrews & Anderson 2004). The size and density of ridges and ledges is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms and limit their growth. Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, horizontal ledges (overhangs) create shaded and downward-facing surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).\nRidges and ledges are sometimes present on quarried boulders used in marine artificial structures (MacArthur et al. 2020), but are often absent from other types of structures. Large ridges and ledges can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively.\nThere is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating these habitats on artificial reefs (e.g. Gratwicke & Speight 2005; Morris et al. 2018). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on in situ conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.\nSee also: Create textured surfaces (≤1 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures; Create small protrusions (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create large protrusions (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create small ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures.\nAndrews K.S. & Anderson T.W.
