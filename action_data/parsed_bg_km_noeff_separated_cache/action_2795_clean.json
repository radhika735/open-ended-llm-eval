Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLimiting the length of fishing gear, such as ropes, lines, or nets, in an area may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This could involve using shorter ropes or lines, or using multiple pots, traps or nets on each line."
