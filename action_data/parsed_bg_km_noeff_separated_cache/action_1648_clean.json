  "action_title": "Rotovate to control grass",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in the UKÂ found that rotovating did not alter the presence of heather compared to mowing or cutting. The same study found that wavy hair grass presence was not altered by rotovating, relative to areas that were mown or cut.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRotovators are machines that have a series of blades that rotate to pierce and disturb soil. Using them disturbs soil and thus may help to control grass species while creating areas of bare ground that may be colonised by shrubland plants."
