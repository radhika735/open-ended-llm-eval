  "action_title": "Reintroduce top predators to suppress and reduce the impacts of smaller non-native predator and prey species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of reintroducing top predators to suppress and reduce the impacts of smaller non-native predator and prey species.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSmall and medium-sized non-native predators can have severe detrimental impacts on native fauna, including mammals (e.g. Doherty et al. 2017). Some evidence suggests that their numbers can be reduced, to the benefit of native fauna, if top predator conservation is promoted, such as through reintroductions (e.g. Nimmo et al. 2015).\nNimmo D.G., Watson S.J., Forsyth D.M. & Bradshaw C.J.A. (2015) Dingoes can help conserve wildlife and our methods can tell. Journal of Applied Ecology, 52, 281–285.\nDoherty T.S., Dickman C.R., Johnson C.N., Legge S.M., Ritchie E.G. & Woinarski J.C.Z.
