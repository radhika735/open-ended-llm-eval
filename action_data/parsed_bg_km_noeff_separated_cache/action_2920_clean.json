  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of restoring habitat for marine mammals. The study was in the Kattegat sea (Denmark).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Kattegat sea found that harbour porpoise activity increased at a stony reef after it was restored with boulders and fishing was prohibited.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDegraded habitats that are important to marine and freshwater mammals, such as reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, rivers and beaches, may be actively restored. This may involve planting vegetation species, transplanting natural materials, such as sediment or rocks, and improving water quality. Habitat restoration is often carried out in combination with habitat protection, which may prohibit degrading activities and allow restored habitats to recover."
