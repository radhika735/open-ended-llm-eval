  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n         \n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using genetically modified crops which produce pesticide to replace conventional pesticide application. This study was in a laboratory.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One controlled study in a laboratory found that pollen from genetically modified maize expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin against European corn borer did not reduce the survival of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars more than pollen from non-genetically modified maize.\nCondition (1 study): One controlled study in a laboratory found that pollen from genetically modified maize expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin against European corn borer did not reduce the growth of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars more than pollen from non-genetically modified maize.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDrift of insecticides with aerial application, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), has been recorded as far as 3 km downwind, and spraying reduces the abundance and survival of a wide range of butterflies and moths (Scriber 2004). The use of genetically modified crops, which can produce pesticides themselves, reduces the need for chemical applications, and may result in an overall reduction in the harm caused to non-target species, including butterflies and moths (Scriber 2004).\nNote that genetically modified plants which produce pesticides are still harmful to butterflies and moths (see Scriber 2004 for examples).\nScriber J.M.
