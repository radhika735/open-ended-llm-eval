  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated study from Sweden and a small study from France found that birds sourced from populations distant from where they were released were less successful than birds from the area.\nIn Sweden, released white storks Ciconia ciconia from North Africa produced fewer than half the chicks as those that naturally re-colonised, whilst both studies found that storks and little bustards Tetrax tetrax were less likely to migrate than birds originating in the release area.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome bird species follow instinctive migration patterns, which vary between populations (Berthold et al. 1984), and populations are likely to be adapted for local environmental conditions. If individuals from one population are released into another area, this could result in maladaptive behaviours, with birds migrating in the wrong direction, or breeding at the wrong time. Sourcing individuals for release from the area that they will be released into may, therefore, improve success rates.\nBerthold, P. (1984) The endogenous control of bird migration: a survey of experimental evidence. Bird Study, 31, 19â€“27."
