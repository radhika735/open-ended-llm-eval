  "action_title": "Maintain/restore/create habitat connectivity on farmland",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of maintaining, restoring or creating habitat connectivity on farmland.\n\n‘We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of some mammal populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Maintaining, restoring or creating corridors of native vegetation between patches of suitable habitat in agricultural landscapes may help to maintain populations. Some specific actions that may encourage movements through farmland are covered in other interventions, including Plant new or maintain existing hedgerows on farmland and Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields."
