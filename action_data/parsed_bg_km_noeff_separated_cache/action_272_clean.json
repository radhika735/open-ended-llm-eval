  "action_title": "Increase ‘on-the-ground’ protection to reduce unsustainable levels of exploitation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo before-and-after studies from Central America and Europe found increases in recruitment and population levels following either stricter anti-poaching measures or stricter protection and the stationing a warden on an island.\nHowever, the Central American study found that recruitment increases were only maintained for as long as the intensive effort was continued.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhilst providing legal protection for species may be effective on its own, it is possible that those exploiting a species or population will not stop unless there is ‘on- the-ground’ or de facto protection – wardens or guards at a site preventing exploitation. However, increasing such protection is expensive and may be unpopular with local people if it is done in an insensitive way."
