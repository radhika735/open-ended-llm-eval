  "action_title": "Provide buffer strips along rivers and streams",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe did not find any evidence describing the impact of riparian strips on reducing water pollution and how this affected bird populations. However, riparian strips also provide valuable habitats in their own right. Studies describing the use of riparian strips by birds are described in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBuffer strips along rivers and streams are designed to reduce pollution from agricultural or other activities from reaching waterways. They should reduce soil erosion and ensure that water remains clearer and less polluted.\nBuffer strips can consist of one or more of: a zone of native, river-side trees; a second zone of native shrubs and a third zone of native grasses and forbs."
