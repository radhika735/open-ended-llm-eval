  "action_title": "Pay landowners to protect peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland habitats of paying landowners to protect them. The study was of bogs.\nPeatland habitat (1 study): One review from reported that agri-environment schemes in the UK had mixed effects on bogs, protecting the area of bog habitat in three of six cases.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLandowners could be paid to protect natural, vegetated peatlands and the benefits they provide (e.g. carbon storage). Landowners may be paid to protect pristine peatlands. Where necessary, they may be paid to actively manage areas to maintain or restore peatlands. Thus, many payment schemes also protect the peatland resource as a whole. Payments could be made directly or as tax incentives, could be paid as cash or as alternative lands, and could come from governments, non-governmental organizations or private sponsorship. Payments should be supported by advice, monitoring and enforcement.\nExamples of payment schemes relevant to peatlands include the Bio-Rights programme (van Eijk & Kumar 2009), the UK Peatland Code and the German MoorFutures® voluntary carbon market (Bonn et al 2014) and nationally or internationally funded agri-environment schemes (Keenleyside & Moxey 2011).\nThis section considers the overall effects of payment schemes on peatland habitats (but excluding information on uptake only e.g. area of land managed under payment schemes, or number of people signed up). Effects of individual interventions performed under payment schemes are considered elsewhere.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: adopt ecotourism principles/create an ecotourism site as a source of funding to protect natural peatlands.\nBonn A., Reed M.S., Evans C.D., Joosten H., Bain C., Farmer J., Emmer I., Couwenberg J., Moxey A., Artz R., Tanneberger F., von Unger M., Smyth M.-A. & Birnie D.
