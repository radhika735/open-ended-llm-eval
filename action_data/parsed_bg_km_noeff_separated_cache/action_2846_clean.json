  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing regulations for the use of underwater drones in proximity to marine and freshwater mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUnderwater drones (also known as ‘Unmanned Underwater Vehicles’) may be used for a wide range of purposes, such as research and monitoring, exploration, inspecting and repairing ship hulls, search and rescue, and military purposes, e.g. terminating underwater mines. This intervention involves introducing regulations for the use of underwater drones in proximity to marine and freshwater mammals, with the aim of reducing disturbance. This may involve setting minimum distances for approaching mammals, and avoiding deployment or removing drones from the water if mammals are present.\nSee also Introduce regulations for flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals."
