This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that installing artificial dams in streams did not increase the survival of Appalachian brown butterfly eggs, caterpillars or pupae.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn natural wetland habitats in northern temperate regions, streams and rivers are dammed by beavers, reducing the flow of water and creating wetlands and pools which are used by many other species. This rise in water levels may be important for the reproductive cycle of other species, including wetland specialist butterflies and moths. However, in many regions, beavers have been extirpated or reduced to very small populations by hunting, leading to a loss of this important wetland habitat. Where the reintroduction of beavers is unfeasible, installing artificial dams may replicate the rise in water levels associated with wild beavers."
