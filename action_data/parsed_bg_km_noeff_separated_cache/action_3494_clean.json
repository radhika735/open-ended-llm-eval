  "action_title": "Leave/maintain/restore strips of undisturbed habitat between solar arrays",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of leaving/maintaining/restoring strips of undisturbed habitat between solar arrays on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSolar arrays are large modular installations constructed with many subunits attached to concrete bases and placed in areas with little traffic and large amounts of sunlight, such as deserts. Reptile populations are disturbed, not only by the installation itself, but by habitat destruction. Leavings strips of undisturbed habitat between solar arrays may act as corridors and allow for reptile populations to successfully persist on large energy farms (Lovich & Ennen 2011).\nLovich J.E. & Ennen J.R. (2011) Wildlife conservation and solar energy development in the desert southwest, United States. BioScience, 61, 982–992."
