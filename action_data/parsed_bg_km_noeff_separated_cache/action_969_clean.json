  "action_title": "Remove turbine lighting to reduce bat and insect attraction",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing turbine lighting to reduce bat and insect attraction on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLights placed on wind turbines may attract insects and foraging bats, increasing the risk of collision. However, one study in the USA found fewer bat fatalities at turbines lit with flashing red aviation lights than at unlit turbines (Bennett & Hale 2014), and three other studies in the USA found no difference (Johnson et al. 2004, Jain et al. 2010, Baerwald & Barclay 2011).\nBaerwald E.F. & Barclay R.M.R. (2011) Patterns of activity and fatality of migratory bats at a wind energy facility in Alberta, Canada. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 75, 1103–1114.\nBennett V.J. & Hale A.M.
