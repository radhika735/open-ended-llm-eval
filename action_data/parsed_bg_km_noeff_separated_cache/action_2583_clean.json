  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing artificial refuges/breeding sites. Two studies were in each of the USA, Spain and Portugal and one was in each of Argentina and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two studies (one controlled), in Spain and Portugal, found that artificial warrens increased European rabbit abundance. A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Argentina found that artificial refuges did not increase abundances of small vesper mice or Azara's grass mice.\nSurvival (1 study): A study in USA found that artificial escape dens increased swift fox survival rates.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): Four studies (two replicated), in Australia, Spain, Portugal and the USA, found that artificial refuges, warrens or nest structures were used by fat-tailed dunnarts, European rabbits, and Key Largo woodrats and Key Largo cotton mice.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNatural dens can reduce the vulnerability of animals to attack. Providing artificial dens and refuges may mimic natural dens, thereby reducing mortality as a result of predation. Refuges and dens may also provide protection from extreme weather conditions.\nThis intervention specifically covers situations where refuges or breeding sites are provided for existing wild mammal populations. For provision of refuges for translocated mammals, see Species Management - Release translocated/captive-bred mammals into area with artificial refuges/breeding sites. See also Provide artificial dens or nest boxes on trees for the specific intervention of providing boxes attached to trees."
