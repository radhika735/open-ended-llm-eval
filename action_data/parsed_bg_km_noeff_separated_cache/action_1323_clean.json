  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the USAÂ found that when macaques were presented with whole foods instead of chopped foods the amount consumed and time spent feeding increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive diets for many primate species consist of vegetables and fruit alongside pellets and browse. In captivity monkeys are primarily provided with chopped up vegetables and fruit, which is not what they would find in the wild. The aim of presenting vegetables whole instead of chopped is to increase the time spent foraging and manipulating the food before consumption."
