  "action_title": "Use lights and sound to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of using lights and sound to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. All three studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including one controlled study), in the USA, found that devices emitting sounds and lights deterred predators from predating sheep or consuming bait.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention specifically refers to use of light and sound in combination, often delivered via a commercially-purchased frightening devise, designed to repel wild mammals. If successful, such an intervention could reduce predation of livestock by predators and thus reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of carnivores. For different applications of similar devices, see Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
