  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of modifying the design/attachments of a W-trawl net used in shrimp/prawn fisheries on unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrate. The study was in Moreton Bay (Australia).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in Moreton Bay found that four designs of W-trawl nets used in shrimp/prawn fisheries caught less non-commercial unwanted catch of crustaceans compared to a traditional Florida Flyer trawl net.\n\nOTHERS (1 STUDY)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in Moreton Bay found that four designs of W-trawl nets used in shrimp/prawn fisheries caught lower amounts of the commercially targeted prawn species compared to a traditional Florida Flyer trawl net.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Trawling can be particularly damaging to benthic invertebrates as they are dragged along the seabed (mid-water trawls can also sometimes accidentally come into contact with the seabed). In addition, trawl nets, and in particular W-trawls used in the prawn/shrimp/nephrops fishery, can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. To reduce the level of disturbance to the seabed and the amount of unwanted organisms caught, the design and/or attachments of the W-trawl net can be modified, for instance by securing the netting at the wing ends, pulling the top tongue of the net forward, modifying the attachment of the ground chain or by using a combination of such modifications (Balash et al. 2016).\n \nBalash C., Sterling D. & Broadhurst M.K.
