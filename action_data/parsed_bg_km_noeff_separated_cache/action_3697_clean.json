  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of removing or controlling non-native/invasive plants on reptile populations. Two studies were in Australia and one was in each of South Africa and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that areas where invasive Bitou bush were sprayed with herbicide had similar reptile species richness compared to unsprayed areas.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized and two before-and-after studies) in the USA and Australia found that areas where invasive Bitou bush or para grass were controlled had a similar abundance of reptiles and combined reptiles and amphibians compared to areas with no control. One study also found that the abundance of delicate skinks was lower in areas with invasive control compared to unmanaged areas. The other study found that removing invasive non-native Sahara mustard had mixed effects on the abundance of Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizards and flat-tailed horned lizards.\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in South Africa found that in areas where an invasive plant was removed, nesting activity by Nile crocodiles increased more than in places with no removal.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasive plants can out compete established plant species and alter habitat structure. This may alter resource availability for reptiles. Some reptile species may benefit but, for others, invasive plants may reduce available food or shelter or change the nature of the environment such that they are at increased risk of predation. Removal or control of non-native invasive plants may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these effects.\nFor studies describing the effect of managing vegetation more generally, see Habitat restoration and creation – Manage vegetation using livestock grazing; Manage vegetation using herbicides; Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing and  Manage vegetation by hand (selective weeding)."
