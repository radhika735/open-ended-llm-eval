  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biodegradable panels in fishing pots on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing is an important source of marine litter (Matsuoka et al. 2005). Once in the marine environment, discarded or lost fishing gears, often referred to as ‘ghost fishing’ (Matsuoka et al. 2005), can accumulate and subsist for a long time due to very slow degradation. There, it can harm subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, entanglement, smothering and habitat modification (Gilardi et al. 2010). Biodegradable panels can be used in fishing pots so that they degrade over time in the marine environment, without harmful effects (Bilkovic et al. 2012). By using biodegradable panels on fishing pots, the risk of subtidal benthic invertebrates getting caught in lost or discarded pots is potentially reduced, or if they are caught, they may be able to escape as the pots degrade.\nEvidence for interventions related to pollution from fishing gear are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Recover lost fishing gear”.\n \nBilkovic D.M., Havens K.J., Stanhope D.M. & Angstadt K.T.
