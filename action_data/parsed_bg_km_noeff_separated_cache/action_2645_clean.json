  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining understorey vegetation within plantations. This study was in Chile.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Chile found that areas with retained understorey vegetation had more species of medium-sized mammal, compared to areas cleared of understorey vegetation.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Chile found that areas with retained understorey vegetation had more visits from medium-sized mammals, compared to areas cleared of understorey vegetation.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUnderstorey vegetation may compete for resources with planted trees, especially when trees are young, and is, therefore, sometimes removed as part of commercial forest management. However, retaining understorey vegetation has the potential to support native mammals (e.g. Carrilho et al. 2017) and may form part of a suite of actions that could attract premium payments for timber products marketed as being biodiversity-friendly.\nCarrilho, M., Teixeira, D., Santos-Reis, M., & Rosalino, L.
