  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo randomized,      replicated, controlled trials in the Czech RepublicÂ found that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants at peak flowering      time dramatically reduced seed production in giant hogweed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves controlling invasive non-native plant species such as giant hogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum, Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera and Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica. Invasive non-native plants may have negative effects on both native plants and animals (Natural England 2011). Techniques to control these species can involve a range of methods including mechanical control such as cutting or cultivation, or herbicide application (Environment Agency 2010).\nEnvironment Agency (2010) Managing invasive non-native plants in or near fresh water. Environment Agency report.\nNatural England (2011) Horizon-scanning for invasive non-native plants in Great Britain. Natural England Commissioned Report NECR053."
