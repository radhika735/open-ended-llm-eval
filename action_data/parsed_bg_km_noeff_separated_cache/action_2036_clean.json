  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of restoring wetlands on bat populations. The study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity (relative abundance), and restored wetlands had similar bat activity to undisturbed wetlands.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWetlands can support high numbers of aquatic insects and provide important foraging and drinking habitats for bats. Wetlands may be created in proximity to existing habitats or habitat corridors. Restoration of wetlands may involve a combination of interventions, such as removing invasive and emergent plants and maintaining bankside vegetation and trees.\nA study that involves the restoration of wetlands alongside other habitats at ex-quarry sites is described in ‘Restore bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites’.\nFor evidence relating to managing water bodies in arid areas, see ‘Manage natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation’."
