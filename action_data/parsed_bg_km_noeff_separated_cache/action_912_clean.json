  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study from Australia found lantana plants in a fire-treated area were smaller and less abundant than an unburned area. One randomized, replicated, controlled trial from India found burned lantana produced fewer new shoots than plants cut to ground level. One replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds, had higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates but more flowering individuals than plants in other lantana-invaded habitats managed by grazing or mechanical control.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled greenhouse trial in India found more lantana seeds germinated and germination rates were higher when seeds were exposed to smoke than seeds not exposed to smoke.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled trial from Australia found two native tree species had higher germination and seedling survival when lantana was burned.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFire can be used as a management tool to control lantana Lantana camara invasions. Fire is considered a low cost method of control and may be used to clear lantana before further management actions, such as herbicide applications, are used (Day et al. 2003).\nLantana is included on the list of ‘100 of the world’s worst invasive alien species’ compiled by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Invasive Species Specialist Group (Lowe et al. 2000). It is classed as an alien invasive species in around 60 countries and its distribution continues to spread (Walton 2006). It is an evergreen shrub in the Verbenaceae family and can grow to a height of 2-5 m (Weber 2003). It has a strong root system and its fruits are dispersed by birds (Walton 2006). Lantana tolerates a wide range of ecological conditions and can rapidly colonize areas of disturbed ground and outcompete native vegetation (Day et al. 2003, Weber 2003). It is problematic in agricultural areas where it may outcompete pasture species, create dense thickets and poison livestock (Day et al. 2003).\nDespite being highly invasive, there is evidence that patches of lantana may provide important shelter and food resources for some native bird species where they do not have access to their preferred natural habitat (Walton 2006). It can also provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths (Day et al. 2003).\nLowe S. J., Browne & S. Boudjelas (2000) 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species.
