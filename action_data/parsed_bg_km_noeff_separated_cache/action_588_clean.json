  "action_title": "Use captive breeding to increase or maintain populations of tinamous",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated study from Costa Rica over three years found that great tinamous Tinamus major successfully bred in captivity, with similar reproductive success to wild birds.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding or ex situ conservation involves establishing and maintaining populations of wild species in captivity whilst attempting to keep the fundamental nature of the species the same (i.e. avoiding domestication). It is frequently used as a technique when wild populations become very small indeed, very fragmented or are declining very rapidly. Captive breeding potentially offers a way to maintain a population of the species whilst the threats to it in the wild are reduced or removed; or of increasing reproductive output and outbreeding beyond what would be possible in the wild.\nLarge-scale captive breeding programmes typically use specially-designed breeding centres, but zoos and wildlife parks can also be used. Whilst the differences between these may impact on the success of captive breeding, we have included both in the following section, as the techniques used should be applicable to both."
