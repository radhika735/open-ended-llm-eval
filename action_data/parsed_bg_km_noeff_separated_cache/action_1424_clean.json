  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of discouraging the planting of fruit trees and vegetable gardens on the urban edge on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn an effort to reduce crop raiding by primates, people may be discouraged to plant fruit trees and create vegetable gardens, particularly using plant species preferred by primates, on the edge of urban areas.\nFor interventions that aim to deter primates see ‘Use of natural thorny hedges’, ‘Use of buffer (unpalatable) crops’, ‘Change of crop (i.e. to a less primate-palatable crop)’ and ‘Plant primate-favoured crops away from primate areas’, ‘Destroy habitat inside buffer zones to make them unusable for primate species’, ‘Use nets to keep primates out of fruit trees’, ‘GPS and/or VHF devices on members of problem troop to provide farmers with early warning and researchers with raiding data’, ‘Chase primates using dogs’, ‘Train langurs to deter rhesus macaques’, ‘Use loud-speakers broadcasting sounds of potential threats (barking dogs, bird-fright explosions, gun-shots etc.)’, ‘Use loud-speakers broadcasting primate alarm play-back calls’, ‘Strategically lay out scent of primate predator (e.g. leopard, lion, etc.)’, ‘Humans chasing primates using noise (no specific sounds, but random noise)’, and ‘Humans chasing primates using bright light (Meerkat Optical Wildlife Rerouter)’."
