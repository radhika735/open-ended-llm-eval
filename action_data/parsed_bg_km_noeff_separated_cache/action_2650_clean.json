  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects on mammals of thinning trees within forests. Six studies were in Canada and six were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSpecies richness (2 studies): A replicated, site comparison study the USA found that in thinned tree forest stands, there was similar mammal species richness compared to in unthinned stands. A replicated, controlled study  in Canada found that thinning of regenerating lodgepole pine did not increase small mammal species richness 12â€“14 years later.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (8 studies): Three of eight replicated, controlled and replicated, site comparison studies, in the USA and Canada, found that thinning trees within forests lead to higher numbers of small mammals. Two studies showed increases for some, but not all, small mammal species with a further study showing an increase for one of two squirrel species in response to at least some forest thinning treatments. The other two studies showed no increases in abundances of small mammals or northern flying squirrels between 12 and 14 years after thinning.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): Three of four controlled and comparison studies (three also replicated, one randomized) in Canada found that thinning trees within forests did not lead to greater use of areas by mule deer, moose or snowshoe hares. The other study found that a thinned area was used more by white-tailed deer than was unthinned forest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is a forestry operation that involves removing some trees in order to allow remaining trees to grow faster, or straighter or otherwise to produce better quality timber. It may especially be applied in young forest, a few years after onset of regeneration or planting. Thinning increases light that reaches the forest floor, potentially adding to habitat diversity, and may enable remaining trees to produce higher quality forage for herbivores.\nThe evidence summarised for this intervention includes one case where trees were selectively thinned to increase overwinter browse availability for deer and one where combinations of thinning and felling of groups of trees were combined.
