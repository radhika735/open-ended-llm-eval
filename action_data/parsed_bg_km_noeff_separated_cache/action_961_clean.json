  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects of using organic farming instead of conventional farming on bat populations. Eight studies were in Europe, two in the USA, one in Canada and one in Chile.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that the composition of bat species did not differ between organic and non-organic farms.\nRichness/diversity (7 studies): Five of seven replicated, paired sites or site comparison studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile found that the number of bat species did not differ between organic and non-organic farms. The other two studies found more bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (12 studies): Five of nine replicated, paired sites or site comparison studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Chile found that overall bat activity (relative abundance) and common pipistrelle activity did not differ between organic and non-organic farms. The other four studies found higher overall bat activity, bat feeding activity, Brazilian free-tailed bat activity, and activity of four of seven bat species on organic farms than non-organic farms. Two replicated, paired sites and site comparison studies in the UK found higher activity of Myotis species over water and rivers on organic farms than non-organic farms, but no differences were found for other species or habitats. One replicated, site comparison study in France found higher activity for two of three bat species over organic fields than two of three types of conventionally managed fields.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic farming is an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost, and biological pest control. Organic standards are strictly regulated in many countries prohibiting the use of chemicals and providing recommendations for management to conserve biodiversity. Organic farming may include combinations of several separate interventions (as discussed separately in this chapter). The studies below examine the effects of organic farming overall.\nFor an intervention that relates specifically to organic pest control, see ‘Use organic pest control instead of synthetic pesticides’. For an intervention that involves reducing the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, see ‘Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertiliser use’."
