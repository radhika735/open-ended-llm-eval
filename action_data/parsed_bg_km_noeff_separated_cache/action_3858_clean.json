  "action_title": "Manage natural waterbodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing natural waterbodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClimate change is altering rainfall patterns globally, leading to increasingly frequent or severe droughts in some areas. Access to water is important for some species of butterfly and moth, including those where the adults gather nutrients by “mud-puddling” (Thomas & Lewington 2016). Droughts can also lead to the desiccation of caterpillar food plants, which in turn may kill caterpillars if the drought coincides with their period of growth and reliance on the plant. Managing natural waterbodies, from small pools to larger areas, may help to protect butterflies and moths by maintaining water availability in the environment.\nFor studies on the creation of scrapes and pools, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Create scrapes and pools”.\nThomas J.A. & Lewington R.
