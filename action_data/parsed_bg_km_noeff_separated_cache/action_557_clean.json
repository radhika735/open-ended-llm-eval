  "action_id": "557",
  "action_title": "Place feeders close to windows to reduce collisions",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA randomised, replicated and controlled experiment in the USA found that placing bird feeders close to windows reduced the number of collisions with the windows and the number of fatal collisions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn urban environments, many people feed garden birds in front of their windows, potentially increasing the risk of birds flying into windows. Determining how distance from windows affects collision rates is therefore very important. Other interventions designed to reduce collisions with windows are discussed in ‘Threat: Residential and commercial development’."
