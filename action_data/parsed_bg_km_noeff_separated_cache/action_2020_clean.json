  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using ‘warm white’ LED lights rather than ‘cool’ LED lights on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLEDs (light-emitting diodes) are increasingly being used in the lighting industry. It has been suggested that ‘warm white’ LED lights emitting little or no ultraviolet component may have less of an impact on bats than ‘cool’ lights emitting blue and ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. Stone et al. 2015). Bat vision is more sensitive to light with shorter wavelengths (e.g. Müller et al. 2009), and ultraviolet lights can attract insects and foraging bats. For similar interventions, see ‘Use ultraviolet filters on lights’ and ‘Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours’.\nMüller B., Glösmann M., Peichl L., Knop G.C., Hagemann C. & Ammermüller J. (2009) Bat eyes have ultraviolet-sensitive cone photoreceptors. PLOS ONE, 4, e6390.\nStone E.L., Harris S. & Jones G.
