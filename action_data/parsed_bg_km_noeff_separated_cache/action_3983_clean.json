  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting more than one crop per field. The study was in Malaysia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not differ in butterfly community composition from those planted with oil palm alone.\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not have greater butterfly species richness than those planted with oil palm alone.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia found that smallholdings planted with oil palm and other crops did not have higher overall butterfly abundance than those planted with oil palm alone.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nModern agricultural fields normally only contain a single crop, making sowing and harvest easier for the farmer. However, for sedentary butterfly and moth species, this may reduce the availability of resources. Planting more than one crop per field may increase the diversity of resources available for butterflies and moths, enabling less mobile species in particular to make better use of the landscape.\nFor studies on increasing diversity across a farm or farmed landscape, see “Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape”."
