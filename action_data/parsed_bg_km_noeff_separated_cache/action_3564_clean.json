  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of removing garbage and other solid waste from terrestrial, aquatic and coastal environments on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that removing beach debris from one section of beach did not increase nesting success in that section.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that after the removal of beach debris from one of three beach sections, a higher percentage of both the total nests laid and failed nesting attempts occurred in that section.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGarbage and other solid waste may pose a number of threats to reptiles, including the potential for entanglement and ingestion, as well as though the introduction of harmful chemicals. Removing this waste from the environment may reduce the risk of harm to wild reptile populations.\nFor studies that incorporate removal of garbage and solid waste as part of wider habitat restoration measures, see Habitat restoration and creation – Whole habitat restoration. For studies of the recovery of derelict fishing gear, see Recover lost or discarded fishing gear."
