However, prescribed burning may also be used in an attempt to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire that could result in the loss of shrubland habitat.\nFernandes, P. M., & Botelho, H. S. (2003). A review of prescribed burning effectiveness in fire hazard reduction. International Journal of wildland fire, 12(2), 117-128."
