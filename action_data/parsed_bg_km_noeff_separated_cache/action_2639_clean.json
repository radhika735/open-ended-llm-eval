  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting. Two studies were in Canada and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled, before-and-after studies and a replicated, site comparison study in Canada and Australia found that retaining patches of unharvested trees instead of clearcutting whole forest stands increased or maintained numbers of some but not all small mammals. Higher abundances where tree patches were retained were found for southern red-backed voles, bush rat and for female agile antechinus. No benefit of retaining forest patches was found on abundances of deer mouse, meadow vole and male agile antechinus.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRemoving trees, through clearcutting or clearfelling, can have substantial, usually negative, effects on forest mammals, through alteration of habitat and removal of food and shelter. Patch retention is the act of leaving groups of trees during harvesting, which may act as refugia to support forest fauna and enable its recolonisation of the remainder of the forest as it regrows."
