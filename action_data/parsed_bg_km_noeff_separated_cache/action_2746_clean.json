  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing and enforcing regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at aquaculture systems.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine and freshwater mammals may be harassed or subjected to harmful deterrents at aquaculture systems in attempts to reduce mammal predation on fish stocks and damage to gear. This may include using bait that is distasteful or emetic (induces vomiting), explosives and warning shots, electric fencing or chasing mammals with boats. Regulations may be introduced and enforced to prevent the use of such measures at aquaculture systems. This may also include the inappropriate use of acoustic devices, which may cause hearing damage and disturbance to both target and non-target mammals (Götz & Janik 2013).\nFor a similar intervention, see Introduce and enforce regulations to prevent the use of harmful deterrents on mammals at wild fisheries.\nGötz T. & Janik V.M. (2013) Acoustic deterrent devices to prevent pinniped depredation: efficiency, conservation concerns and possible solutions. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 492, 285–302."
