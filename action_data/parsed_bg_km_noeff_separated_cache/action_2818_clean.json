  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using an electric current to deter mammals from fishing gear. The study was in the Fraser River (Canada).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One controlled study in the Fraser RiverÂ found that using an electric current on a fishing net reduced Pacific harbour seal predation on salmon catches.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLow-voltage electric currents may be used to deter marine and freshwater mammals from fishing gear. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in gear, as well as human-wildlife conflict resulting from mammal predation on fish catches. However, caution is required to ensure that mammals that have contact with the gear are not injured. There may also be safety risks for fishers operating electrified gear."
