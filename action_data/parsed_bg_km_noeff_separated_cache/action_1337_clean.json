  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo before-and-after studies in Japan and the USAÂ found that when the number of feeds per day were increased the amount of time spent feeding increased in chimpanzees, but hair eating also increased in baboons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAnticipating the arrival of food can lead to stress behaviours in captive animals. Changing the number of feeds per day reduces the predictability of feeds within the day with the aim of increasing the amount of time animals spend foraging for foods by decreasing stress behaviours."
