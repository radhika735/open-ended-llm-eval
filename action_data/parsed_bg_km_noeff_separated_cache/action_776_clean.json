  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in Taiwan found that education programmes about wetlands and amphibians, along with other interventions, doubled a population of Taipei frogs.\nThree studies (including one replicated study) in Germany, Mexico, Zimbabwe and the USA found that education programmes increased the amphibian knowledge of students, boatmen and their tourists. Two studies (including one replicated study) in Germany and Slovenia found that students who were taught using live amphibians and had previous direct experience, or who participated in outdoor amphibian conservation work, gained greater knowledge, had improved attitudes towards species and retained knowledge better than those than those taught indoors with pictures.\nFour studies in Mexico, Taiwan, Zimbabwe and the USA found that courses on amphibians and the environment were attended by 119–6,000 participants and amphibian camps by 700 school children.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProviding education programmes about amphibians can be a valuable way to raise awareness about the threats to species and the habitats that they live in and about what can be done to help. They can also help to change perceptions and may therefore indirectly help towards conserving species."
