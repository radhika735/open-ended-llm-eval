  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of closing roads in defined seasons. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that closing roads to traffic during the hunting season increased use of those areas by mule deer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome mammals may avoid areas around roads (e.g. Rost & Bailey 1979). Closing these roads to traffic, especially at times of the year when they most use the habitat that the road runs through, may increase their use of such areas and, hence, increase their access to natural resources such as food and shelter.\nRost G.R. & Bailey J.A. (1979) Distribution of mule deer and elk in relation to roads. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 43, 634â€“641."
