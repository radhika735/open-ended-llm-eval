  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring ponds on reptile populations. Two studies were in the USA and one was in each of Austria and China.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): Four studies (including one replicated and one before-and-after study) in Austria, the USA and China reported that following the creation of ponds, in one case 30–60 years after pond creation, or restoration of a river island that included creation of ponds grass snakes and sand lizards were found on the island, and ponds were occupied by mangrove salt marsh snakaes, common snapping turtles and midland painted turtles and Chinese alligators.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPonds are often drained, left to dry or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Ponds created to improve wildlife habitat, e.g. for fish or frogs, may also used by reptiles such as snakes and turtles (Adams & Saenz 2011). Restoration of ponds may therefore help to increase populations of reptiles that are dependent on ponds. Ponds may be restored (or maintained to prevent desiccation) by deepening, de-silting, or re-profiling activities, planting new or managing existing vegetation to provide appropriate shading levels and basking sites for reptiles, and adding woody debris.\nFor studies discussing wetlands and waterway management, see Create or restore wetlands or Create or restore waterways.\nAdams C.K. & Saenz D. (2011) Use of artificial wildlife ponds by reptiles in eastern Texas. Herpetological Bulletin, 115, 4–11."
