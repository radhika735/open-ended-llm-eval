  "action_title": "Skunk cabbage:  Biological control using native herbivores",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on biological control of skunk cabbage using native herbivores.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIncreasing the numbers of a native herbivorous species, normally an arthropod, can increase the level of foraging to levels higher than normally endured by the target (Gassmann et al. 2006).  This can potentially be used as a means of controlling invasive plants.   For example, slugs, snails, ants, earwigs, flies and rove beetles have been observed to feed on skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus populations in France (Lebreton 2007).  It is possible that increasing numbers of these native herbivorous species could control skunk cabbage.\nGassmann A., Cock M.J.W., Shaw R. & Evans H.C. (2006) The potential for biological control of invasive alien aquatic weeds in Europe: a review. Hydrobiologia, 570, 217-222.\nLebreton A.
