  "action_title": "Use clearcutting to increase understory diversity",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight of 12 studies (including three replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Israel, spain and the USA found that clearcutting increased the cover and  species richness of understory plants. Two found it decreased the density and species richness, and two found no effect or mixed effects.\nThree of six studies (including five replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Brazil, Canada and Spain found that clearcutting increased the density and species richness of young trees. One found it decreased new tree density and two found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species.\nThree of nine studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Australia, Brazil4, Canada, Japan and the USA found that clearcutting decreased density, species richness and diversity of mature trees. One study found it increased trees species richness .Six studies found no effect or mixed effects on tree density, size and species richness and diversity.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClearcutting of native forests is an undesired action from the perspective of nature conservation. However, it can be used as a conservation management practice to restore natural open areas that were artificially planted, to preserve herbaceous and other understory plant diversity, and for changing forest composition whenever desired. Studies comparing the effects of clearcutting with partial thinning are discussed in ‘Threat: Biological resource use - Use partial retention harvesting instead of clearcutting'."
