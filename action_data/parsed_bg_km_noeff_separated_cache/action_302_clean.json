  "action_title": "Use bird exclusion devices (BEDs) such as ‘Brickle curtains’ to reduce seabird mortality when hauling longlines",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA study of longliners in the South Atlantic found that fewer seabirds were caught on longlines hauled under BEDs with two booms, compared to those with a single boom.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAlthough most birds caught as bycatch are caught as the lines are set, they may also be vulnerable when the lines are hauled in, with birds attempting to take the remaining baits or even caught fish. Bird exclusion devices (BEDs) such as ‘Brickle curtains’ hang around the hauling point and are designed to prevent birds getting to the line, which will only be visible for a short time as it reaches the boat."
