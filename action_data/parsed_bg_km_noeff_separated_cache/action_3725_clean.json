  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of releasing reptiles into burrows on their populations. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in the USA found that both releasing translocated gopher tortoises into abandoned or artificial burrows or releasing without burrows had low success, but providing burrows inside release pens resulted in more successful translocations.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome reptiles rely on burrows to provide shelter from predators or weather extremes. Providing burrows as part of releasing translocated reptiles increases the suitability of the release habitat and reduces the immediate requirements on individuals (which may already be stressed from the translocation process) to find suitable shelter in a novel environment."
