  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing along roads. Eight studies were in the USA, one each was in Canada, Germany and Brazil and one spanned the USA, Canada and Sweden.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (9 studies): Three controlled studies, in the USA, Germany and Brazil, found that roadside fencing or equivalent barrier systems reduced the numbers of mammals, including wildcats and coypu, killed by vehicles on roads. Two before-and-after studies, in the USA, found that roadside fencing with one-way gates to allow escape from the road, reduced the number of collisions between vehicles and deer. A study in the USA found that a 2.7-m-high fence did not reduce road-kills of white-tailed deer compared to a 2.2-m-high fence. A controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that barrier fencing with designated crossing points did not significantly reduce road deaths of mule deer. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Canada found that electric fences, (along with an underpass beneath one highway), reduced moose-vehicle collisions. A review of fencing studies from USA, Canada and Sweden, found that longer fencing along roadsides led to a greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars than did shorter fence sections.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (5 studies): A controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that 2.3-m-high fencing in good condition prevented most white-tailed deer accessing a highway. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Canada found that electric fences reduced moose access to highways. Three studies (two replicated), in the USA, found that higher fences (2.4–2.7 m) prevented more white-tailed deer from entering highways than did fences that were 2.2 m high, 1.2 m high with outriggers or 1.2–1.8 m high.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWildlife barrier fencing aims to prevent animals from crossing roads. They are typically wire mesh fences 2–2.5 m high running parallel to the road. Although fencing may protect wildlife from traffic, it should not create an absolute barrier that prevents migration, isolates populations, fragments habitat, or causes injuries. Wildlife fencing is therefore usually combined with safe crossing opportunities such as wildlife underpasses and overpasses (see Install overpasses over roads/railways, Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways, Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads). Wildlife escapes, such as one-way gates, are often integrated with wildlife fencing to allow animals that do manage to cross the fence to escape from the fenced road (see: Install one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways). Wildlife such as deer frequently try to pass through holes in fences and so fences must be well maintained (Ward 1982).\nStudies included here are those that specifically assess fence effectiveness, sometimes in combination with other collision reduction actions, but not where effects of fencing cannot be separated from effects of road underpasses. For these interventions combined, see Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads.\nAs well as the threat to wildlife from vehicles, fencing is often placed to reduce dangers and costs to motorists that can result from collisions with wildlife. Assessment of whether or not to install fences may be based on a cost-benefit analysis (e.g. Huijser 2009).\nWard A.L.
