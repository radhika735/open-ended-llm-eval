  "action_title": "Create new unlit commuting routes using planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating new unlit bat commuting routes using planting on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLinear features such as hedgerows and treelines provide important commuting routes for bats (Limpens & Kapteyn 1991, Verboom & Huitema 1997, Downs & Racey 2006). Where original commuting routes cannot be retained, new unlit commuting routes could be planted. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for hedgerows or trees to become established and sufficiently mature. Existing commuting routes should be retained where possible. See ‘Retain existing bat commuting routes’.\nFor an intervention that involves diverting bat commuting routes, see ‘Divert bats to safe crossing points over or under roads/railways with plantings or fencing’.\nDowns N.C. & Racey P.A. (2006) The use by bats of habitat features in mixed farmland in Scotland. Acta Chiropterologica, 8, 169–185.\nLimpens H.J. & Kapteyn K. (1991) Bats, their behaviour and linear landscape elements.
