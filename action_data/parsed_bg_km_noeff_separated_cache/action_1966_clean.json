  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of maintaining bat roosts within road bridges on bat populations. One study was in Ireland and one in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)      \n\nUse (2 studies): One before-and-after study in Ireland found that a maternity colony of Daubenton’s bats continued to roost in a road bridge over a river in similar numbers after crevices were retained during repair work. One review in the USA found that when bat roosts were maintained during bridge replacement works, Yuma myotis and Mexican free-tailed bats recolonised most roosts in similar numbers to before the works, but pallid bats did not return.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats can roost in gaps, cracks or between beams within road or railway bridges and culverts (e.g. Feldhamer et al. 2003, Celuch & Sevcík 2008, Geluso & Mink 2009). A study in the USA found over four million bats of 24 species roosting in 211 road bridges and culverts (Keeley & Tuttle 1999). Maintenance, repairs, or bridge/culvert replacement work may result in the loss of potential roost sites, entombment or injury of roosting bats, and abandonment of roosts and/or young.\nFor a similar intervention see ‘Create spaces for roosting bats in road/railway bridges and culverts’.\nCeluch M. & Sevcík M.
