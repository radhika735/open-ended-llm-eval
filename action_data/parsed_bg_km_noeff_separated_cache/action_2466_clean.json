  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of airborne translocation of mammals using parachutes. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A study in the USAÂ found that at least some North American beavers translocated using parachutes established territories and survived over one year after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocating animals into remote terrain can be logistically challenging. Holding animals for several days while moving across ground can cause them stress and, potentially, illness or mortality. Dropping animals from an airplane means that they can be held captive for shorter periods, though it may be harder to choose the precise release location. Parachutes, combined with a container that opens upon landing, can be used in aerial drops."
