  "action_title": "Establish fishing gear registration programmes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing fishing gear registration programmes on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals may become entangled in lost or abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Establishing fishing gear registration programmes (e.g. with gear markers displaying vessel, permit or licence numbers) may allow lost or abandoned gear to be traced back to the owner. This may encourage the responsible disposal of gear by fishers and reduce the risk of mammal entanglement.\nStelfox M., Hudgins J. & Sweet M. (2016) A review of ghost gear entanglement amongst marine mammals, reptiles and elasmobranchs. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 111, 6–17."
