  "action_title": "Reduce intensity of hunting/collecting animals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of hunting/collecting animals in marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHunting or collecting animals from marshes or swamps (or animals that use these habitats) can damage vegetation. The hunting/collecting activity can directly damage vegetation, e.g. trampling by foot traffic along shorelines used by anglers (USFWS 2006). Removing key animal species can have indirect effects on vegetation. For example, massive die-offs of salt marsh in the southeastern USA were probably related to overharvesting of predatory crabs – which used to eat and control the population of herbivorous snails (Silliman & Bertness 2002). Reducing hunting/collecting intensity (e.g. removing fewer animals on each hunting trip, or removing only individuals of a certain sex or size) may reduce these direct and indirect impacts.\nNote that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any intensity, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of hunting/collecting animals;     Control populations of wild vertebrates (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Control populations of wild invertebrates.\nSilliman B.R. & Bertness M.D. (2002) A trophic cascade regulates salt marsh primary production.
