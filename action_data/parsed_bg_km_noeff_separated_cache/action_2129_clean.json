  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of outfitting trawls with a raised footrope on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The footrope consists of a rope, wire or chain which is attached to the bottom front of the net (the lower edge of the net mouth) to provide weight to keep the net on or near the seabed. Footrope configuration varies with trawls and the commercial species targeted, and can affect the level of negative impacts on the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hannah et al. 2013). To potentially reduce contact with the seabed, and therefore direct damage and disturbance, the footrope can be raised.\n \nHannah R.W., Lomeli M.J. & Jones S.A. (2013) Direct estimation of disturbance rates of benthic macroinvertebrates from contact with standard and modified ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) trawl footropes.
