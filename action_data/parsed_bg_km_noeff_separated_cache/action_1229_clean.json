  "action_title": "Use herbicides to control invasive plant species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasions by non-native species are considered a major threat to biodiversity.  One way of controlling invasive plants is by using herbicides. This action may also affect the abundance of plants other than the targeted species, and as result influence the forest structure and composition."
