  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA study in Scotland recorded lower lice numbers on Atlantic salmon in cages using a fallowing system. Another study in Australia found no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in cages where a fallowing system had been used.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHusbandry practice on salmon farms is important in reducing the spread of disease within and beyond the farm. Fallowing has been practiced in terrestrial agriculture for centuries to reduce the incidence of disease. Many salmon farms use fallowing as a technique for disease control and some to reduce the build-up of sediments below cages. Chemical and biological remediation of benthos near salmon farms has been proven. A two month fallowing cycle is mandatory to break parasite cycles on salmon farms."
