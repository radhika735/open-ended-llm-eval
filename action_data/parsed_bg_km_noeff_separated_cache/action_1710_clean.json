  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that adding sulphur to soil alongside sowing seeds did not increase heather cover in a majority of cases. One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that adding sulphur and spreading heathland clippings had mixed effects on cover of common heather, perennial rye-grass, and common bent. One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that adding sulphur to soil alongside planting of heather seedlings increased their survival, though after two years survival was very low.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding sulphur to soils can increase their acidity and when done alongside planting or sowing of seed may help to increase the survival and growth of plants that favour acid conditions."
