  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using domestic animals to drive away wild mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in India.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One study in India found that using domestic elephants to drive wild Asian elephants away from villages did not reduce the probability of elephants damaging crops.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDomestic mammals may be used in attempts to repel wild mammals of the same species that are causing nuisance, such as be crop-raiding. This intervention is likely to be especially relevant where the wild animal presents a potential threat to people such that simply chasing animals away may not always be a viable or effective option. If the intervention is effective, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of the focal species."
