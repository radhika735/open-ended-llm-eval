  "action_title": "Use mechanical thinning before or after planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive of six studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Brazil, Canada, Finland, France and the USA found that thinning trees after planting increased survival and size of the planted trees. One study found it decreased their density. One study found that the effects of thinning on the size and survival rate of planted trees varied between species.\nOne replicated study in the USA found that the survival rate of red oak seedlings increased with the size of the thinned area.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMechanical thinning, that is removal of some trees to reduce the density, is used in restored forest areas to help the establishment of the remaining planted trees by reducing the competition for resources."
