  "action_title": "Adopt voluntary agreements to protect peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland habitats, of adopting voluntary agreements to protect them.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVoluntary agreements or codes (i.e. not legally binding) could be used to protect peatlands. Such agreements prevent or restrict activities that damage specific peatlands. They may apply within a focal peatland or in surrounding habitats to prevent threats from spilling over into peatlands. Additionally, voluntary agreements often encourage peatland restoration or creation to protect the overall peatland resource. For example, members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) are prohibited from clearing primary forest, discouraged from using fire to clear land, encouraged to leave corridors to connect forest patches and encouraged to restore or rehabilitate neighbouring peatland (Parish et al. 2012). The Ramsar Convention provides the basis for voluntary agreements to protect wetlands (including peatlands), although it is often translated into legal protection by national legislation (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2007).\nThis section considers the overall effects of protecting peatlands with voluntary agreements (but excluding information on uptake only e.g. area of land or number of people signed up to agreements). Effects of individual interventions performed under voluntary agreements are considered elsewhere.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nParish F., Lim S.S., Perumal B. & Giesen W.
