  "action_title": "Reduce the amount of pesticides used in aquaculture systems",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing the amount of pesticides used in aquaculture systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPesticides are chemicals used in aquaculture to reduce or eliminate pests. However, pesticides may contaminate aquatic environments with adverse impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. The risks associated with using pesticides may be reduced by applying them in smaller doses, less frequently or across a smaller area. Alternatively, live organisms may be used instead of chemicals to control pests (Thresher 2005).\nTreasurer J.W. (2005) Cleaner fish: a natural approach to the control of sea lice on farmed fish.
