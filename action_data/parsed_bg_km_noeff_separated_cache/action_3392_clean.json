  "action_title": "Produce guidance for marsh or swamp conservation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of producing guidance for marsh or swamp conservation. The study was in Sri Lanka.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One study of coastal sites in Sri Lanka found that planted mangrove propagules/seedlings had a higher survival rate in sites where published guidance had been consulted to select appropriate areas for planting, than in sites where guidance was not consulted.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProducing guidance, manuals or evidence syntheses to improve the effectiveness of marsh or swamp conservation is, in itself, a conservation action! Effectiveness could be considered in terms of changing the behaviour of practitioners (Is the guidance consulted? Do practitioners change their behaviour when presented with guidance?) and, ideally, in terms of impacts on marsh or swamp vegetation (Are projects that use guidance more effective than those that do not?).\nGuidance may be based on personal knowledge or experience, or be a more formal synthesis of published evidence (e.g. the synopses produced by Conservation Evidence, systematic reviews or meta-analyses). However, to be considered as evidence for this action, the guidance must have been written or used for the conservation of marsh or swamp vegetation.\nTo be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the guidance is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests)."
