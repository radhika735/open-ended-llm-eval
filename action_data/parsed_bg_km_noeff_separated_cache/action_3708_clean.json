  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty-six studies evaluated the effects of translocating tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles on their populations. Sixteen studies were in the USA, two were Global and one was in each of Italy, the Seychelles, Madagascar, Cameroon, Egypt, China, Jordan and France.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (4 studies): One replicated study and one of two global reviews reported that three of eight translocations of turtles resulted in established populations and 15 of 47 reptile translocations resulted in stable or growing populations (review included both wild-caught and captive bred animals). The other review (both wild-caught and captive bred animals) reported that one of five translocation of tortoises and snapping turtles was unsuccessful and four had unknown outcomes. One study in the Seychelles found that 47% of translocated Aldabra giant tortoises were found 12 years after releaser.\nReproductive success (5 studies): One global review reported that successful reproduction was found in three of five translocations of tortoises and snapping turtles (review included both wild-caught and captive bred animals). Two of three studies (including one replicated, randomized study) in the USA, Italy and Madagascar reported successful reproduction in translocated populations of gopher tortoises and radiated tortoises. The other study reported no evidence of reproduction for three years following a translocation of European pond turtles. One replicated study in the USA found that translocated female Agassiz’s desert tortoises bred successfully following release, but all hatchlings were sired by resident tortoises, not translocated males.\nSurvival (16 studies): Two of four controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that translocated eastern box turtles and Eastern painted turtles had lower survival than resident turtles. The other two studies found that translocated desert tortoises and musk turtles had similar survival to that of resident turtles. One replicated study in the USA found that translocated gopher tortoises released into temporary enclosures had similar survival compared to head-started tortoises also released into temporary enclosures over four years. Five of 11 studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA, Italy, Cameroon, Egypt, China, Jordan and France reported that 69–100% of 3–40 translocated individuals survived for monitoring periods of one month to two years. Four studies reported that 19–43% of 15–109 translocated individuals survived for 2–3 years. The other two studies reported that 0–1% of 15 and 249 translocated individuals survived for up to a year.\nCondition (3 studies): One controlled study in the USA found that translocated Eastern painted turtles lost more body mass than resident turtles. One controlled, before-and-after, replicated study in the USA found that translocated desert tortoises had similar stress levels compared to resident tortoises. One study in the USA found that one translocated Blanding’s turtle grew over a two-year period following release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): Two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in the USA found that one of 13 translocated gopher tortoises returned to its point of capture, and no Agassiz’s desert tortoises translocated &gt;5 km returned to their point of capture.\nBehaviour change (7 studies): Two of six studies (including three replicated, controlled studies) in the USA and Jordan found mixed effects on the movement of translocated red-eared slider turtles in spring or autumn and on the movement and home range size of translocated eastern box turtles compared to residents. Two studies found that four measures of behaviour of translocated musk turtles and home range size of translocated spur-thighed tortoises were similar to residents. One study found that translocated gopher tortoises moved more and had larger home ranges than resident tortoises. The other study found that after ephemeral ponds dried up, translocated Eastern painted turtles did not move to new ponds whereas resident turtles did. One replicated study in France found that the home ranges of translocated European pond turtles were smaller in the year after release compared to the year they were released.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught reptiles into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding; help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the occupied range. Translocations can also be used to move reptiles to areas where threats have been removed, such as islands where invasive predators have been eradicated. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild, to ‘soft releases’ that involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care.\nThis action includes studies which may combine different release techniques, but studies that explicitly test these different techniques are summarized separately under Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.\nThis action includes the translocation of wild juvenile or adult reptiles. Relocations of eggs and nests, releases of captive bred individuals and releases of head-started individuals (reptiles of wild-origin reared in captivity prior to release) are discussed under: Relocate nests/eggs; Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild; Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release and Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. For studies that release reptiles outside of their native range see Release reptiles outside of their native range.\nTranslocations that are carried out to mitigate against specific threats (for example translocating problem individuals away from a specific area, or translocating individuals away from development areas) are summarized under Mitigation translocations – Translocate problem reptiles; Translocate reptiles away from threats and Temporarily move reptiles away from short-term threats.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Snakes; Lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara."
