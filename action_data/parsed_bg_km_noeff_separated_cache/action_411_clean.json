  "action_id": "411",
  "action_title": "Guard nests to prevent predation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on the effects of guarding nests to prevent predation for bird populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf populations are reduced to extremely low levels and continue to be threatened by nest predation, then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and protect nests from predators through direct interference. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers to do it, and the population being monitored is very small.  Nest guarding can be used as a response to range of threats and is therefore discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’."
