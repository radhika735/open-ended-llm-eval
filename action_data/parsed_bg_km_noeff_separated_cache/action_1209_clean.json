  "action_title": "Thin trees within forests: effects on mature trees",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven of 12 studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Brazil, Canada, and the USA found that thinning trees in forests decreased the density and cover of trees. One study found no effect of thinning on tree density.\nFive of six studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in Australia, Sweden and the USA found that thinning trees in forests increased tree size. One found mixed effects of thinning on tree size.\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA found that thinning trees in forests decreased tree species richness and diversity.\nOne replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that thinning reduced the number of conifers killed by beetles. Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found no effect of thinning on bark-beetle caused tree mortality.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is the removal of trees to control the development or enhance the future condition of a forest, by adjusting its density, structure and species composition.\nStudies looking at tree removal with the aim of removing biomass are discussed in 'Logging/tree removal within forest'."
