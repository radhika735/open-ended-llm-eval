  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs to restore or create forested/shrubby peatland. Three studies were in bogs and two were in fens.\nGermination (2 studies): Two replicated studies in a bog in Germany and a fen in the USA reported germination of heather and willow seeds, respectively, in at least some sown plots.\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated study in a bog in Germany reported survival of some heather seedlings over two years. One replicated study in a fen in the USA reported that all germinated willow seedlings died within one month.\nShrub cover (3 studies): Two studies (one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in bogs in New Zealand and Estonia reported that plots sown with shrub seeds (sometimes along with other interventions) developed greater cover of some shrubs than plots that were not sown: sown manuka or naturally colonizing heather (but not sown cranberry). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a fen in the USA found that plots sown with shrub (and herb) seeds developed similar overall shrub cover to unsown plots within two years.\nOverall vegetation cover (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a bog in New Zealand and a fen in the USA reported that plots sown with shrub (and herb) seeds developed greater total vegetation cover than unsown plots after two years. One site comparison study in bogs in Estonia reported that sowing shrub seeds (along with fertilization) had no effect on total vegetation cover after 25 years.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (3 studies): One site comparison study in bogs in Estonia reported that sowing shrub seeds (along with fertilization) increased plant species richness. However, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a bog in New Zealand reported that plots sown with shrub seeds typically contained fewer plant species than plots that were not sown. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a fen in the USA found that sowing shrub (and herb) seeds had no effect on plant species richness.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs, including directly sowing seeds, spreading vegetation fragments on the peatland that will not themselves grow but contain seeds (e.g. seed-rich heather brash), or adding peat/soil that contains seeds of peatland plants. Adding vegetation fragments may have the additional benefit of protecting the peat surface, controlling moisture levels and providing shade. Note that this section does not include studies that only introduce, or report responses of, nurse plants (e.g. Caporn et al. 2007).\nDirect introduction of peatland vegetation might be necessary in severely degraded or bare peatlands. Natural revegetation (from remnant plants, seed banks or dispersal) might not happen, might be very slow or might not produce the desired mix of species.\nCaution: Collecting seeds from natural peatlands may damage the source site. Trees and shrubs are not natural features of all peatlands: growth of woody plants is often a threat to bogs and fens. Trees could dry out peatlands by taking up water.\nRelated actions: directly plant whole plants into peatland (mosses, herbs or shrubs/trees); spread vegetation onto peatland surface (mosses or mixed vegetation); restoration using more than three interventions, sometimes including planting; supporting interventions from this section used without introducing vegetation (e.g. mulching or fertilizing); experimental tests of interventions to complement planting (e.g. mulching or fertilizing).\nCaporn S., Sen R., Field C., Jones E., Carroll J. & Dise N.
