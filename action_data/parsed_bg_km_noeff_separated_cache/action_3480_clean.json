  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating suitable habitats to offset habitat lost within a development footprint on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDevelopment activity may be accompanied by a biodiversity ‘offsetting’ strategy that aims to compensate for the loss of existing habitat and associated species by protecting other sites or creating new sites of equal value to the lost habitat (e.g. Bull et al. 2014, Ives & Bekessy 2015). Offsetting may be ‘in-kind’, whereby new habitat is similar to that lost (for example creating ponds to replace ponds lost elsewhere), or ‘out-of-kind', whereby the new habitat is different (for example creating rock outcrops to replace lost grasslands elsewhere). Existing green spaces such as golf courses — known to support substantial wildlife numbers, especially urban-adapted species (Hodgkison et al. 2007) — have been proposed as potential sites for biodiversity offsets (Burgin & Wotherspoon 2009). Studies describing habitat restoration that is not compensatory for urban development or is carried out retrospectively rather than planned alongside the development, are summarized under Habitat restoration and creation.\nBull J.W., Gordon A., Law E.A., Suttle K.B. & Milner‐Gulland E.J.
