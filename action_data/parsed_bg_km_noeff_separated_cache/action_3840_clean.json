  "action_title": "Require developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessments when submitting planning applications",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of requiring developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessment when submitting planning applications.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAny new residential or commercial development is likely to impact butterflies and moths through either habitat destruction or disturbance. However, by assessing the risk to species populations in advance, and making changes to the plans, it may be possible for careful planning of necessary developments to minimize these negative impacts. Legal requirements for developers to complete Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), if independently produced, reviewed and enforced, may be beneficial to butterfly and moth conservation. For example, see DFFE (2021).\nDepartment of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (2021) National Web Based Environmental Screening Tool.
