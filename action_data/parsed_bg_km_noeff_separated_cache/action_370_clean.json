  "action_id": "370",
  "action_title": "Revegetate gravel pits",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of gravel pit revegetation on bird populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhilst mining can be a very damaging activity, it can also create habitats. After quarries and gravel pits become disused, they may offer valuable aquatic, terrestrial and marshland habitats, particularly if they are close to urban areas (Catchpole and Tydeman 1975). These habitats can often be bare immediately after abandonment, so restoring vegetation to them may greatly improve their value as habitats.\nCatchpole, C.K. & Tydeman, C.F. (1975) Gravel pits as new wetland habitats for the conservation of breeding bird communities. Biological Conservation, 8, 47â€“59."
