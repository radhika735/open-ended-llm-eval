  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that mulching with woodchips before planting native understory herbs either increased or had no significant effect on their overall cover, one year later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that mulching with woodchips before planting native understory herbs reduced the cover of one problematic species (common reed Phragmites australis) one year later, but had no significant effect on another (reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic mulches (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can be placed on the surface of wetlands to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of planted vegetation. Examples of substances than can be used as mulches include compost, straw, seagrass leaves and seaweed (macroalgae).\nCaution: It may be necessary to sterilize mulch before applying it, with heat or radiation, to kill propagules of undesirable plants. Adding organic matter as a mulch may be less labour intensive than mixing it into the soil or sediment, but increases the risk of the material being washed away.\nRelated actions: Add surface mulch, other than to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting."
