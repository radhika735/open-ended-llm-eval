  "action_title": "Add cover other than mulch before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding cover other than mulch to brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in Mexico.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGrowth (1 study): One controlled study on a sandflat in Mexico reported that planted black mangrove Avicennia germinans seedlings grew more in height, over six months, when shaded with black mesh than when not shaded.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanted vegetation may be damaged by hot, dry and bright conditions on bare wetland surfaces. Covers such as plastic mesh, sheets, or shelters for individual plants could ameliorate these factors and help planted vegetation to establish. The precise effect of covers may vary depending on the material used and how it is applied (e.g. to a large area vs individual plants; on the wetland surface vs suspended above the surface).\nRelated actions: Add cover other than mulch, other than to complement planting; Add surface mulch to complement planting; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas from physical damage, e.g. with tree guards or breakwaters."
