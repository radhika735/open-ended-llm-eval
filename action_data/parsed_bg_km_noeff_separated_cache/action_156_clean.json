  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found 34 studies comparing use of set-aside areas with control farmed fields. Two were reviews, none were randomized, replicated, controlled trials. Of these, 20 (from Austria, Finland, Germany and the UK) showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered. Twelve (from Finland, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and the UK) found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops, others did not. Two studies (all from the UK) found no effect, one found an adverse effect of set-aside.\nThree of the studies, all looking at skylarks, went beyond counting animal or plant numbers and measured reproductive success. Two from the UK found higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields. One from the UK found lower nest survival on set-aside.\nFifteen studies (from Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK) monitored wildlife on set-aside fields, or in landscapes with set-aside, without directly comparing with control fields or landscapes. Three looked at set-aside age and found more plants or insects on set-aside more than a year old. Two compared use of different non-crop habitats and found neither insects nor small mammals preferred set-aside. Two showed increased bird numbers on a landscape scale after set-aside was introduced, amongst other interventions. Eight looked at effects of set-aside management such as use of fertilizer and sowing or cutting regimes.\nA systematic review from the UK found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nAllocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008.  The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity within farmland.  Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5-20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate.  Unlike fallow land left for the benefit of ground-nesting birds or arable plants, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing.\nSet-aside is often managed by cutting and/or spraying.  In some cases, set-aside land has had strips of wildflowers or grasses sown on it. Evidence for the effects of this management has been included under the following interventions: ‘Plant nectar flower mixture wildflower strips’ and ‘Plant grass buffer strips margins around arable or pasture fields’."
