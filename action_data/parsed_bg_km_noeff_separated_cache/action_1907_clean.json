  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effect of supplementing meat-based diets with vitamins or minerals on captive carnivores.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe diet offered to captive carnivores can vary and often not replicate their wild-type diet which includes bones, cartilage, and skin. This can cause negative effects on their gastrointestinal health. Supplementing diets is common practice to promote the overall health of captive animals, however there can still be differences in the fermentation process of these diets.  See 2.2 ‘Feed whole carcasses with or without organs/gastrointestinal tract)’."
