  "action_id": "168",
  "action_title": "Support or maintain low-intensity agricultural systems",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe captured no evidence for the effects of supporting low-intensity agricultural systems on bird populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLow-intensity agricultural systems have consistently been shown to have higher biodiversity than more intensive systems, both in temperate regions and the tropics. Supporting such systems may therefore help declining farmland bird populations. However, whilst we captured many studies describing the distribution of birds across high- and low-intensity agricultural systems, we found no intervention-based evidence for the effects of legislation aimed at supporting and maintaining low-intensity agricultural systems on bird populations."
