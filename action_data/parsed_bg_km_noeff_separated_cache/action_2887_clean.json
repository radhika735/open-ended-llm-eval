  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of offering incentives to fishers for recovering, reusing or recycling fishing gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals may become entangled in lost or abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Offering incentives may encourage fishers to recover, reuse or recycle fishing gear. For example, ‘buyback’ programmes offer fishers a financial reward for retrieving and returning derelict gear (e.g. Cho 2009).\nSee also Recover lost or discarded fishing gear and Equip ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities.\nCho D.-O.
