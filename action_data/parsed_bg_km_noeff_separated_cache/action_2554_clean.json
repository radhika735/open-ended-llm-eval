  "action_id": "2554",
  "action_title": "Provide dams/water holes during drought",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing dams or water holes during drought.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClimate change may increase the frequency of droughts. Populations of some mammal species that are reliant on availability of water may be buffered against effects of drought by artificial provision of water. This could be through digging holes down to the water table or building dams, to store water for use in times of drought.\nFor cases where provision of water as an intervention is a response to water shortage caused by other human-induced activities, rather than directly via climate change, see Natural system modifications - Provide artificial waterholes in dry season."
