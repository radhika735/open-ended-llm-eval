  "action_title": "Use weakened fishing gear",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using weakened fishing gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing weakened fishing gear may allow entangled or hooked marine and freshwater mammals to release themselves more easily. This may involve using nets and ropes with a reduced breaking strength (e.g. Knowlton et al. 2016), or weak links between fishing lines, buoys, or net panels. The bending strength of hooks may be decreased to a level that retains the target catch but allows caught mammals to release themselves by straightening the hook (sometimes referred to as ‘weak hooks’; Bayse & Kerstetter 2010, Bigelow et al. 2012). However, mammals may still be injured by weakened gear, and it is important to assess the survival of released animals (McLellan et al. 2014). This intervention may also increase the amount of debris and derelict fishing gear in marine and freshwater environments.\nBayse S.M. & Kerstetter D.W.
