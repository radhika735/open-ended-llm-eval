  "action_title": "Use holding pens at release sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree replicated and one small study from three release programmes in Saudi Arabia, the USA and Canada found that released birds had higher survival or were more likely to pair up if kept at release sites in holding pens before release.\nA replicated study in the USA found lower survival for thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha released in holding pens, compared to birds released without preparation.\nA review of northern bald ibis  Geronticus eremita conservation found that holding pens successfully prevented most birds from migrating (which resulted in 100% mortality), although some 200 birds ‘escaped’ over 25 years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive-bred individuals may well take time to adjust to life in the wild, without regular food and potentially in an unfamiliar habitat. It may therefore increase the chances of birds surviving if they are kept at the release site for some time before being released, either enclosed in pens or with access to the habitat outside.\nThis section includes only those studies that make a comparison between releases using holding pens and those without. Many of the studies in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’ describe releases that use holding pens, but do not test the effects of using them."
