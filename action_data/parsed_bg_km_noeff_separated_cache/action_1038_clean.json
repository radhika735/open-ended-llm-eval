  "action_title": "<i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Relocate vulnerable crayfish",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effect of relocating native species as a management tool against the effects of Procambarus crayfish.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne of the greatest concerns about invasive crayfishes is their potential to displace native crayfish species, through transmission of crayfish plague or through competitive displacement. A randomised, replicated, controlled, before and after study from the UK (Haddaway et al. 2012) revealed that relocation of a native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes to avoid the invasive signal crayfish, had no negative effects on growth, survival or morphology of the native species.\nHaddaway N. R., Mortimer R.J.G., Christmas M., Grahame J.W., & Dunn A.M. (2012) Morphological diversity and phenotypic plasticity in the threatened British white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). Aquatic conservation: marine and freshwater ecosystems, 22, 220â€“231."
