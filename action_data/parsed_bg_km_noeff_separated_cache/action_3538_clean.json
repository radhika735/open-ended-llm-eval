  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of regulating wildlife harvesting on reptile populations. One study was in each of Costa Rica, Australia, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One before-and-after study in Australia found that following legal protection and harvest regulations, the density of saltwater crocodile populations increased. One before-and-after study in Japan found that following regulation of the green turtle harvest in combination with allowing harvested turtles to lay eggs prior to being killed, the number of nesting females tended to be higher.\nReproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in Japan found that following regulation of the green turtle harvest in combination with allowing harvested turtles to lay eggs prior to being killed, the number of hatchlings produced in natural nests tended to be higher.\nCondition (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that following legal protection and harvest regulations, the average size of crocodiles increased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nHuman behaviour change (2 studies): One replicated study in Costa Rica found that in an area with a legalized turtle egg harvest run by a community cooperative, a majority of people reported a willingness to do more to protect sea turtles. One study in Indonesia reported that quotas to regulate wildlife harvesting did not limit the number of individuals of three reptile species that were harvested and exported.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe harvesting of reptiles and their eggs may be regulated by preventing trade altogether, or by setting harvesting and export quotas that are designed to enable the population to reach or remain at a particular level. However, it should be noted that in some cases the basis for determining such quotas is not clear, and numbers may not be evidence based (Auliya 2010). Whilst many hunting systems use quotas, the studies included here are those based on species with particular conservation concerns rather than where quotas are based purely on maximising the harvest.\nSee also Species management â€“ Legally protect reptile species for studies that discuss comparisons of where harvesting is prohibited compared to allowed.\nAuliya M.
