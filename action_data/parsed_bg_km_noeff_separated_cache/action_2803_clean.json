  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on freshwater mammals of using a larger mesh size for fishing trap-nets. The study was in the River Indal (Sweden).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One controlled study in the River Indal found that a fishing trap-net with a larger mesh size in the first two sections had fewer grey seals feeding around it and less damage caused by seals.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrap-nets are stationary nets that have a series of net chambers, which fish can enter but not easily escape from. It has been suggested that using a larger mesh size for trap-nets may discourage marine and freshwater mammals, such as seals, from feeding on trapped fish, which may reduce the risk of entanglement as well as human-wildlife conflict. Fish chased by mammals could escape through a larger mesh and would be less likely to become entangled in the side panels of the trap-net. This may make trap-nets less attractive to feeding mammals."
