  "action_title": "Implement speed limits in particular areas (e.g. with high primate densities) to reduce vehicle collisions with primates",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of implementing speed limits in particular areas to reduce vehicle collisions with primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpeed limits in areas with high traffic and high primate densities may help to prevent vehicle collisions with primates and also reduce stress levels in primates. Furthermore, primates may be able to cross roads more easily in areas where speed limits are enforced compared to areas with no traffic regulations. However, a study investigating the barrier effect of roads on the bank vole Myodes glareolus, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and common shrew Sorex araneus found that traffic intensity did not affect crossing rates in any of these species (Rico et al. 2007).\n     Imposing fines for breaking the speed limit or for colliding with primates is discussed under ‘Impose fines for breaking the speed limit or colliding with primates’.\n \nRico A., Kindlmann P. & Sedlácek F. (2007) Barrier effects of roads on movements of small mammals. Folia Zoologica, 56, 1-12."
