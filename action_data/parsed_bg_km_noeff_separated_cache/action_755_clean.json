  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Tanzania found that installing a sprinkler system to mitigate against a 90% reduction of river flow did not maintain a population of Kihansi spray toads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReduction in river flow due to activities such as the implementation of hydropower projects can have significant effects on wetland habitats and the amphibians they support. In cases where alternative habitat is not available, intensive management may be undertaken to recreate natural habitats in attempt to conserve particular species. For example, the wetland habitat in the study described below was the only known habitat for the Kihansi spray toad Nectophrynoides asperginis."
