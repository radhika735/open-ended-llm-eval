  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting recreational fishing and/or harvesting on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRecreational harvesting (free divers, spear fishers) and fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal, either intentionally, or unintentionally through accidental unwanted catch (in the case of fishing), physical damage and disturbance (Cooke & Cowx 2006; Milazzo et al. 2002). Recreational fishing and harvesting could be limited in one area, by restricting the activity in space and time (limits on duration and occurrence, delimiting allowed areas). It could be ceased by setting a permanent or temporary closure (e.g. seasonal closure), or prohibited through bylaws. This may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with these activities and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time.\nWhen restrictions of recreational activities occur in the context of a marine protected area, evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection”, including “Habitat protection - Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all types of fishing”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and only allow hook and line fishing”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of scallops”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of conch” and “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of sea urchins”. Other evidence for interventions related to recreational boating is summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Shipping lanes”.\n \nCooke S.J. & Cowx I.G.
