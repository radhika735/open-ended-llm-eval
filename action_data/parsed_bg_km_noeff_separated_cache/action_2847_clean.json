  "action_title": "Introduce regulations for flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing regulations for flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAerial drones (also known as ‘Unmanned Aerial Vehicles’) may be used for research and monitoring of marine and freshwater mammals, or for recreational activities. However, flying drones over mammals may cause disturbance and elicit an avoidance response (e.g. Ramos et al. 2018). Introducing regulations for the use of aerial drones in proximity to mammals may reduce disturbance. This could involve setting minimum flight heights, avoiding direct approaches, minimising flight times above the same group of animals, avoiding flights over animals with young, using camouflaged or low-noise devices and/or aborting flights if disturbance occurs.\nSee also Introduce regulations for the use of underwater drones in proximity to marine and freshwater mammals.\nRamos E.A., Maloney B., Magnasco M.O. & Reiss D. (2018) Bottlenose dolphins and Antillean manatees respond to small multi-rotor unmanned aerial systems. Frontiers in Marine Science, 5."
