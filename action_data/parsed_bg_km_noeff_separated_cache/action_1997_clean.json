  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of maintaining small dams as foraging and drinking habitat for bats on bat populations. The study was in Portugal.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity (relative abundance) of four bat species than the streams feeding into them.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge dams are likely to have a negative impact on bats due to habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. Rebelo & Rainho 2009). However, small dams along rivers can create pools and reservoirs within natural habitats, which may provide foraging and drinking resources for bats. For interventions that involve creating other types of water sources, see ‘Create artificial water sources’.\nRebelo H. & Rainho A. (2009) Bat conservation and large dams: spatial changes in habitat use caused by Europe’s largest reservoir. Endangered Species Research, 8, 61–68."
