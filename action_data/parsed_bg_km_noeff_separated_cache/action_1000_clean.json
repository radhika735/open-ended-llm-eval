Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats have long been the victims of negative public opinion due to mythology involving vampires and witchcraft, and associations with disease, such as rabies, the Ebola virus, and more recently the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Education programmes, campaigns and events to dispel myths and to educate the public about the importance of bats and bat conservation have been put in place in some countries and may benefit bat populations by improving human behaviour towards bats. Three studies in the USA (Rule & Zhbanova 2012, Hoffmaster et al. 2016, Lu et al. 2017) and two in the UK (Kaninsky et al. 2018) found that providing education to the public resulted in more positive perceptions and beliefs about bats.\nHoffmaster E., Vonk J. & Mies R.
