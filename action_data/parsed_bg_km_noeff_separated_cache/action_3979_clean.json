  "action_id": "3979",
  "action_title": "Plant in-field trees (e.g. copses)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting in-field trees on butterflies and moths.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntensively farmed areas have often lost much of their natural habitat structure, such as woodland, which would provide shelter, resources and structural variation for butterflies and moths. One option for encouraging species back on to farmland is the creation of small areas of woodland – or copses – within or at the edge of farmed land.\nFor studies on protecting existing trees, see “Protect in-field trees”."
