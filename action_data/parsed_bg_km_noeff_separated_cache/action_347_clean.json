  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nThree of four studies, one replicated and controlled, found that numbers of terns, American coot and waders were found at higher densities on wetland areas sprayed with herbicide, compared to unsprayed areas. However, one study found that wader numbers were not as high as on ploughed areas. One replicated and controlled study found that songbird densities were lower on sprayed than unsprayed areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWetlands can become overgrown with vegetation, particularly if they have unusually high nutrient levels, or if invasive plants (with no natural predators) are present. Very dense vegetation can exclude open-water species from a wetland, meaning that treating the wetland with a herbicide may be beneficial. However, conservationists should be aware that some herbicides, such as glyphosate, can be extremely toxic to amphibians and fish (Relyea 2005).\nRelyea, R.A. (2005) The lethal impact of Roundup on aquatic and terrestrial amphibians. Ecological Applications, 15, 1118â€“1124."
