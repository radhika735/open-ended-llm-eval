  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in Uganda found that no gorillas were killed over 21 months after game guards received training, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Rwanda found that the number of immature gorillas increased in areas where game guards received training, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in India found that a population of hoolock gibbons increased after sanctuary staff received training, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Cameroon found that no incidents of primate poaching occurred over a three year period after anti-poaching rangers were trained, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWith the aim of making anti-poaching patrols more effective, this intervention involves providing training to anti-poaching patrols. Such training can involve preparing teams for encountering dangerous situations in the field, training them to navigate using the compass and GPS, collect and record data, teaching them about wildlife laws and how to enforce them, etc.  \n            The patrolling of areas by anti-poaching teams to reduce hunting is discussed separately under ‘Conduct regular anti-poaching patrols’. The providing of better equipment to anti-poaching teams and the removal of ground snares by snare-removal teams that may form part of anti-poaching teams is discussed under ‘Provide better equipment (e.g. guns) to anti-poaching ranger patrols’ and ‘Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares’. The use of monitoring surveillance strategies and/or monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols is discussed under ‘Implement monitoring surveillance strategies (e.g. SMART) or use monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols’."
