  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing training to vessel operators on mammal behaviour and appropriate avoidance techniques.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves providing training to vessel operators on marine and freshwater mammal behaviour and appropriate avoidance techniques. Mammals may not be sighted until they are in relatively close range of a vessel, such that a rapid response is required to avoid the animal, particularly when vessels are travelling at high speeds. Equipping vessel operators with appropriate knowledge and techniques to avoid mammals may reduce the risk of collisions. Training may be carried out with visual aids or simulators, as well as on board vessels.\nSee also Provide educational materials at marinas and ports to encourage vessel operators to carry out safe practices around mammals (e.g. signs, leaflets)."
