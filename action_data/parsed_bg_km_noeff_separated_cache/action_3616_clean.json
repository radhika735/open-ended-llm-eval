  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of changing the hook baiting technique on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One study in the USA found that captive loggerhead turtles were more likely to attempt to swallow thread-baited than single-baited hooks.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHow bait is connected to a hook may affect the likelihood of reptiles swallowing the bait and hook together. Changing the baiting technique may involve using whole bait instead of smaller chunks or changing the way that the bait is threaded onto a hook. Single baiting involves putting a fishing hook once through the bait item, whereas thread baiting involves threading the hook through the bait multiple times. As a result, it may be easier for reptiles to strip bait off fishing gear without swallowing the hooks when single baiting is used. Similarly, whole bait rather than chunks of bait may be more easily removed by reptiles.\nSee also: Use dyed bait and Use a different bait type."
