  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of removing vegetation before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. One study was in each of the UK and Belgium.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nGermination/Emergence (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Belgium found that removing vegetation before sowing seeds increased the germination rate of sown species. The other study found that removing vegetation, along with removing leaf litter, before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings for one of three species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFollowing conversion to arable agriculture or pasture, many grasslands are dominated by a relatively small number of plant species. Removal of this vegetation before sowing seeds of grassland species may aid the germination and colonization of grassland plants.\nThe studies summarised below removed vegetation using mechanical methods. For evidence relating to the removal of vegetation using herbicide, see ‘Apply herbicide before seeding/planting’ or for burning, see ‘Burn vegetation before seeding/planting’."
