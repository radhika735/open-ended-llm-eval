  "action_title": "Physically protect nests from predators using non-electric fencing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies from the USA and UK found that fewer nests were predated or failed when predator exclusion fences were erected.\nTwo studies from the USA found that nesting success or fledging success did not differ between areas with fences erected and those without fences; although one found that hatching rates were higher with fences.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe simplest way to exclude predators from a nesting area is to erect a fence around it. This is likely to be relatively cheap and easy, but may also prevent non-predators from entering the area, with potentially unforeseen results."
