  "action_title": "Use wire fences within grazing areas to exclude livestock from specific forest sections",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour of eight studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA found that excluding livestock using wire fences increased  biomass , species richness, density and cover of understory plants. The other four studies found mixed effects or no effect of livestock exclusion on understory plants.\nThree of four studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama found that excluding livestock using wire fences increased the size and density of regenerating trees and the number of regenerating trees. One study found livestock exclusion decreased tree density but not tree size.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLivestock grazing changes habitats, mainly by changing soil properties, plant composition, structure and diversity (Alkemade et al. 2013). High grazing pressure can degrade understory species diversity. This is mainly due to decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous and low woody species. Using wire fences to excluded livestock from regularly grazed forested areas may increase species diversity (Crawley 1983). Other studies aimed to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Prevent livestock grazing from forest areas’.\nAlkemade, R., Reid, R. S., van den Berg, M., de Leeuw, J., Jeuken, M.
