  "action_title": "Equip ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of equipping ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals may become entangled in abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Equipping ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities may encourage fishers to dispose of gear responsibly and may therefore reduce the risk of mammal entanglement.\nSee also Offer incentives to fishers for recovering, reusing or recycling fishing gear.\nStelfox M., Hudgins J. & Sweet M. (2016) A review of ghost gear entanglement amongst marine mammals, reptiles and elasmobranchs. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 111, 6–17."
