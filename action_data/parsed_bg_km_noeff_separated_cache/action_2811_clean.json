  "action_title": "Introduce economic incentives to encourage sustainable fishing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing economic incentives to encourage sustainable fishing on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSustainable fishing practices limit harvest levels to prevent overfishing and help reduce unwanted catch. However, for fishers, fishing more sustainably may involve changing to a more selective fishing gear or a reduction in catch quantities, both of which incur economic outlay or loss. Economic incentives to use or change to more sustainable practices, and thus reduce the effects of overfishing, may encourage uptake by helping to offset economic losses (Costello et al. 2010).\nCostello C., Lynham J., Lester S.E. & Gaines S.D. (2010) Economic incentives and global fisheries sustainability. Annual Review of Resource Economics, 2, 299–318."
