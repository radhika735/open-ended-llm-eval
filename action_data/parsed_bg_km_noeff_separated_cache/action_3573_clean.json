  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of establishing emergency plans for oil spills.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column and can contaminate beaches and other coastal habitats. Oil spill emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, should an oil spill occur. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of the response to minimize harmful impacts (Li et al. 2016).\nLi P., Cai Q., Lin W., Chen B. & Zhang B. (2016) Offshore oil spill response practices and emerging challenges. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 110, 6–27."
