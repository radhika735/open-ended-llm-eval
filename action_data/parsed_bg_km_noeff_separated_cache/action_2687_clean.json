The study was in the North Sea (Norway). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nImproved size-selectivity of fishing gear (1 study): One replicated, paired study in the North Sea found that changing the towing speed of a bottom trawl net did not increase the size selectivity of small cod and haddock.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Fish entering the net will either be retained by it or may escape through the gaps in the mesh of the trawl netting during fishing. Many factors can influence the likelihood of a fish being caught or escaping from a trawl (termed selectivity or efficiency) including species, size of fish, time of day, trawl configuration and towing speed. The towing speed of a net may affect the size and shape of the meshes through which fish may escape. But it may also affect how likely a fish is to avoid entering the net in the first place. Fish behaviour differs on encountering different trawl nets (Krag et al. 2014) and the towing speed of the net may further change the ability of fish to escape in response to the altered hydrodynamics that may require a different swimming behaviour. Fish have been seen to actively escape trawl nets by accelerating in bursts or changing direction, or, more commonly, escaping in response to contact with the net (Jones et al. 2008). Depending on the species, a faster or slower towing speed may allow more fish to escape.\nEvidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments’ and ‘Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net’.
