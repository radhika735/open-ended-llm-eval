  "action_title": "Regulate planning permission for gas/filling stations at reptile sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of regulating planning permission for gas/filling stations at reptile sites.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGas/filling stations present an important source for oil-based pollution to enter the surrounding environment (Hilpert et al. 2015). Regulating where gas/filling stations can be built may reduce the potential for pollutants to enter the environment in areas with important reptile habitats and may have positive effects on wild populations.\nHilpert M., Mora B.A., Ni J., Rule A.M. & Nachman K.E.
