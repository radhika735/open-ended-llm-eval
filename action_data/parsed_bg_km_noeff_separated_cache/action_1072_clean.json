  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated, controlled laboratory study in Canada found 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours of exposure to water of 30% salinity.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nChanging the salinity of an invaded waterbody may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of gobies, provided potentially negative effects on native species are managed carefully. Increasing the salinity to a very high level is likely to have significant effects on non-target species."
