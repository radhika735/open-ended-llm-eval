  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne site comparison in Laos found that Laotian black crested gibbons occurred at higher densities in areas where they were protected by a local hunting taboo than at sites were there was no taboo.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWe know that in many areas of the world, people, communities and religions have taboos against the killing and/or eating of certain primate species (e.g. Brncic et al. 2010, Costa 2010, Jimoh et al. 2012, Xiang et al. 2013). However, it has also been suggested that the presence of other tribes, new religions/westernization, use of modern hunting equipment and poverty pose a threat to the effectiveness of taboos as a conservation tool (Jimoh et al. 2012). The strengthening, supporting or re-installing of traditions/taboos that forbid the killing of primates may therefore lead to a reduction in hunting rates.\n            The implementation of community policies/traditional hunting ban is discussed under ‘Implement local no-hunting community policies/traditional hunting ban’, and installing community control of anti-poaching activities is discussed under ‘Implement community control of patrolling, banning hunting and removing snares’.\n \nBrncic T.M., Amarasekaran B. & McKenna A.
