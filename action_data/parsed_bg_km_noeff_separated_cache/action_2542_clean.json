  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of translocating mammals away from a site contaminated by oil spill. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A study in the USA found that after being translocated in a trial of responses to a hypothetical pollution incident, most sea-otters survived for the duration of monitoring.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A study in the USA found that after being translocated in a trial of responses to a hypothetical pollution incident, most sea-otters did not return to their capture location.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhere there is a large pollution event that has potential to affect wild mammals, one intervention option may be to translocate these mammals to another site. In such event, the translocation would be an emergency action, carried out with minimal planning. It would only be likely to be considered where the survival chances of mammals would be very low otherwise."
