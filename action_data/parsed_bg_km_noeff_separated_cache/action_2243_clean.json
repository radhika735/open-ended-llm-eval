  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of engaging with stakeholders when designating a Marine Protected Area on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities (Kelleher 1999). Engaging with stakeholders when designing protected or closed areas may empower resource users and lead to greater uptake, as well as minimising the social and economic effects of closing fishing grounds. This in turn can ensure protection enforcement and potentially the natural recovery of subtidal benthic invertebrates (Gleason et al. 2013; Pomeroy & Douvere 2008).\nRelated evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection – Establish community-based fisheries management”.\n \nCollie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. & Poiner I.R.
