  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.\n\nâ€˜We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves leaving areas of uncut ryegrass Lolium perenne in silage fields. Ryegrass seeds are a potential food source for small mammals, but cutting ryegrass fields multiple times a year for silage removes seed heads before they can ripen and so reduces the food available the following winter. Leaving fields or plots uncut may provide overwinter food for small mammals and may also provide suitable habitat away from damaging harvesting machinery."
