  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of freshwater wetlands – of treating their seeds with chemicals before sowing. Both studies were in one laboratory in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE \n       \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in a laboratory in the USA found that soaking baldcypress Taxodium distichum seeds in weak sodium hydroxide increased their germination rate. One of the studies found that soaking in ethyl alcohol and/or hydrochloric acid reduced the germination rate. One of the studies found that soaking in stronger sodium hydroxide, or hydrogen peroxide and ethyl alcohol, had no significant effect on the germination rate.\nGrowth (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a laboratory in the USA found that soaking baldcypress Taxodium distichum seeds in chemicals before sowing typically had no significant effect on the height of surviving seedlings, 30 days after germination. Soaking in ethyl alcohol, however, reduced seedling height.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAcids and bleach may weaken the seed coat, increasing its permeability to water and gases which are essential breaking dormancy and inducing germination (Baskin & Baskin 2014). They may also sterilize seeds, killing fungi that may otherwise reduce germination rates. Hormones are widely used in agriculture and horticulture to stimulate germination and growth (Small & Degenhardt 2018). Other molecules such as nitrates act as signals within plants and may stimulate germination (Alboresi et al. 2005).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak seeds before sowing; Chill seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing.\nAlboresi A., Gestin C., Leydecker M.T., Bedu M., Meyer C. & Truong, H.N.
