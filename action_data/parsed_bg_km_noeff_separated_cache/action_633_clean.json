  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies from Saudi Arabia and Hawaii found that bustards and geese had lower survival when released in temporary exclosures with clipped wings, compared to birds released with unclipped wings.\nA review of cackling goose  Branta hutchinsii conservation found that wing-clipped or moulting wild adult geese proved a better strategy than releasing young geese.\nA review of northern bald ibis (waldrapp)  Geronticus eremita conservation found no differences in survival between birds released with clipped and unclipped wings in Israel.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHolding pens are designed to allow birds to adjust to their environment before being released, but if they leave before they are ready, the pens may have no effect. Therefore preventing birds from leaving by clipping their wings may increase the time they spend in the pens and their survival.\nA similar intervention is the use of ‘wing brails’ to prevent birds from flying. Brails are bands attached to wings to prevent birds extending them and so preventing birds from flying. We captured no evidence of the effects of wing brails, but several studies describe their use in the release of cranes Grus spp. These are described in ‘Release captive-bred individuals’."
