  "action_title": "Fit livestock with protective collars to reduce risk of predation by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of fitting livestock with protective collars to reduce human-wildlife conflict on rates of livestock killings by predators. This study was in South Africa.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, before-and-after study in South Africa found that livestock protection collars reduced predation on livestock by carnivores.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCarnivores typically kill their prey by a fatal bite to the neck. Hard collars can protect animalsâ€™ necks. This may increase the effort needed by predators to kill livestock and, thus, reduce the likelihood of a fatal bite. If the intervention results in fewer livestock predated, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators."
