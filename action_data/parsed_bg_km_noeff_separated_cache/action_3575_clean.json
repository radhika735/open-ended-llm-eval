This study was in the USA1.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in the USA1 found that almost all sea turtles that were de-oiled recovered and could be released.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOil spills are an obvious threat in marine and aquatic environments because the oil spreads quickly through the water column. The oil clings to animals, remains long-term in the environment, and is often ingested. Heavily oil-covered or chronically oil-exposed turtles may have respiratory, skin and shell problems. Oiled turtles are also known to have increased white blood cell counts, reduced red blood cell counts, increased numbers of immature red blood cells, acute inflammation of skin and mucosal surfaces (Lutcavage et al. 1995).  Long-term consequences of oil exposure are not well understood, but a high incidence of embryo deformity is known from turtle populations with chronic oil exposure (Bell et al. 2006). Other long-term indirect problems may include delayed mortality due to hindgut bacterial death in marine iguanas (Wikelski et al. 2002) and an increase in disease (Milton et al. 2003).\nReptiles may be rescued, rehabilitated and released back into the wild following oil spills to mitigate the negative effects of exposure.\nFor other studies relating to the re-release of injured reptiles or accidentally captured reptiles see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals and Biological resource use – Release accidentally caught (‘bycatch’) reptiles.\nBell B., Spotila J.R. & Congdon J.
