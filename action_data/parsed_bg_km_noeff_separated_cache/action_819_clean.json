  "action_title": "Plant riparian buffer strips",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUncultivated strips of vegetation at the edge of waterways are often used to help reduce pollution entering the water within agricultural and forestry systems. These buffer strips therefore help to protect aquatic and semi-aquatic species.\nStudies that investigated retaining riparian buffers are discussed in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Logging & wood harvesting – Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest’, ‘Habitat protection – Retain buffer zones around core habitat’ and ‘Threat: Agriculture – Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’."
