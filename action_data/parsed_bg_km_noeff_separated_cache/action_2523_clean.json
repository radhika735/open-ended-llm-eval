  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing ledges in culverts under roads or railways. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Portugal.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nUse (3 studies): A replicated, controlled study in Portugal found that under-road culverts with ledges were used more than culverts without ledges by two of five mammal species. A before-and-after study in the USA found that installing ledges within under-road culverts did not increase the number or diversity of small mammal species crossing through them, and only one of six species used ledges. A study in the USA found that ledges in under-road culverts were used by nine of 12 small mammal species and ledges with access ramps were used more often than those without.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCulverts may be installed under roads to enable drainage. They are sometimes also used by mammals to cross under the road and, in some cases, roadside fencing will be designed to funnel mammals towards culvert entrances. However, some mammals are resistant to passing through tunnels that have water at their base (Serronha et al. 2013). Ledges may be installed on the sides of culverts, above the usual water level, to assist animal passage.\nSee also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under roads and Install tunnels/culverts/underpasses under railways.\nSerronha A.M., Mateus A.R.A., Eaton F., Santos-Reis M. & Grilo C.
