  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of using acoustic devices at aquaculture systems. Four studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA, UK), one was in the Reloncaví fjord (Chile) and one in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Four of six studies (including five before-and-after and/or site comparison studies and one controlled study) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Reloncaví fjord and the Mediterranean Sea found that using acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching a fish cage. The two other studies found that using acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms, or reduce the presence, approach distances, groups sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAcoustic devices may be used to deter marine or freshwater mammals from aquaculture systems. These are high power devices that operate by emitting sounds of an intensity and frequency that are aversive to the target mammal species. The primary aim has usually been to reduce mammal predation on fish stocks and damage to gear (therefore reducing human-wildlife conflict), although the risk of mammal entanglement may also be reduced. However, the high intensity sounds produced by acoustic devices have the potential to cause hearing damage to target species (Götz & Janik 2013). Negative and far-reaching effects have also been reported for non-target marine mammal species, such as killer whales and harbour porpoises (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002). The use of multiple acoustic devices within an area has the potential to cause significant noise pollution (Findlay et al. 2018).\nFindlay C.R., Ripple H.D., Coomber F., Froud K., Harries O., van Geel N.C.F., Calderan S.V., Benjamins S., Risch D. & Wilson B.
