  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Use of lightproof barriers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on the use of lightproof barriers to control parrot’s feather.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCovering submerged weeds with lightproof barriers, such as plastic foils, tarpaulins or black sheeting, can control growth and eventually kill plants by preventing photosynthesis (De Winton et al. 2013). Lightproof barriers have been used to control other species of the same genus of parrot’s feather with some success (Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum) (Laitala et al. 2012). The method is not species-specific and its usage is usually restricted to small-scale management in slow-flowing or static waterbodies (Hussner et al. 2017).\n \nDe Winton M., Jones H., Edwards T., Özkundakci D., Wells R., McBride C., Rowe D., Hamilton D., Clayton J., Champion P. & Hofstra D.
