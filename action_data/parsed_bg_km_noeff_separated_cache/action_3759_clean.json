  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using artificial insemination on reptile populations. This study was in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated study in New Zealand found that none of 10 artificially inseminated McCannâ€™s skinks gave birth within a year of insemination, though around five were gravid after nine months.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDuring programmes to rear endangered animals in captivity, in preparation for reintroductions into the wild, artificial insemination may be used to initiate pregnancies. The technique may be used instead of natural mating in situations where animals are being kept at different facilities; to increase pregnancy rates; or where natural mating has failed. It may also be carried out using preserved sperm for purposes of maintaining genetic diversity.\nStudies included here are those identified by our searches of conservation journals. It is likely that other relevant studies exist in biological journals that specialize in reproduction."
