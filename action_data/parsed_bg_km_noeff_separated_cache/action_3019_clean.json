  "action_title": "Restrict vehicle use",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restricting vehicle use in or near marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVehicles such as cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats can directly damage marsh and swamp vegetation (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999; Kelleway 2005). Vehicles can also compress and rut soft, wet soils, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects vegetation. Waves created by boats and jet skis can increase erosion of lake and sea shores (Bilkovic et al. 2017). To prevent this damage, or allow recovery from damage, vehicle use within or near to marshes/swamps could be restricted. This might apply to the total number of vehicles, their speed and/or the routes they can take. Specific means to achieve these restrictions include legislation, voluntary codes, signage and/or ensuring official routes are well maintained.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must include a clear intervention to restrict vehicle use. Studies of different vehicle use intensities imposed by researchers are not included (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999).\nRelated actions: Physically exclude vehicles; Designate protected area and Provide general protection for marshes or swamps against other or multiple threats.\nBilkovic D., Mitchell M., Davis J., Andrews E., King A., Mason P., Herman J., Tahvildari N. & Davis J.
