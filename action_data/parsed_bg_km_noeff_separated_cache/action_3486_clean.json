This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that sites managed under agri-environment schemes had similar reptile species richness compared to sites that were managed purely for livestock production or areas of unmanaged woodland.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that sites managed under agri-environment schemes had similar reptile abundances compared to sites that were managed purely for livestock production or areas of unmanaged woodland.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFinancial incentives to undertake specific management actions with the aim of increasing biodiversity on farmland may be provided by government or non-governmental organisations. For example, agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practices to be more favourable to biodiversity and the landscape. Agri-environment schemes include many different specific interventions relevant to conservation. Where a study describes a specific intervention, e.g. Create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields, it is summarized under that specific action. Here we include studies that describe the effectiveness of payments such as those included in agri-environment policies where specific actions are not clearly defined."
