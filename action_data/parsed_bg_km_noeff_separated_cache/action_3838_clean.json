  "action_title": "Plant trees to reduce temperatures in cities",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting trees to reduce temperatures in cities on butterflies and moths.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCities generate large amounts of heat, and as a result are often warmer than surrounding areas of natural habitat, a phenomenon known as the ‘urban heat island effect’ (Kleerekoper et al. 2012). For species which are otherwise able to survive in cities, higher temperatures may cause problems for survival and reproduction. Planting trees within cities provides shade, and actively cools the environment by increasing evapotranspiration (Kleerekoper et al. 2012). This may provide benefits for temperature-sensitive butterflies and moths, but could be detrimental if the trees replace other important habitats.\nKleerekoper L., van Esch M. & Salcedo T.B. (2012) How to make a city climate-proof, addressing the urban heat island effect. Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 64, 30–38."
