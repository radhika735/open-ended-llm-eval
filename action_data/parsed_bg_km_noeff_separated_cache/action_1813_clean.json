  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of covering a peatland with organic mulch (without planting). Both studies were in bogs (but in one study, being restored as a fen).\nVegetation cover (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada found that covering bare peat with straw mulch did not affect cover of fen-characteristic plants. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Australia reported that plots mulched with straw had similar Sphagnum moss cover to unmulched plots.\nCharacteristic plants (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada found that covering bare peat with straw mulch increased the number of fen characteristic plants present, but did not affect their cover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Organic mulches (e.g. straw, grass cuttings or shrub roots) can be placed on the peatland surface to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of peatland vegetation (Good et al. 2009). Typically, mulch is applied sparsely enough that some light can still reach the peat surface. Caution: Mulches may contain seeds of undesirable plants. Sterilization before application can kill these.\nThis section considers the effect of adding mulch without adding living vegetation. The mulch is intended to help existing vegetation e.g. remnant moss patches, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already in the peat.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: cover peat with something other than mulch e.g. plastic sheets or shade cloths; add mulch after planting.\nGood R., Wright G., Whinam J. & Hope G.
