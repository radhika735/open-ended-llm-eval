  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of installing green bridges as road crossing structures for bats. The study was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)      \n\nUse (1 study): One study in the UK found that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGreen bridges are bridges over roads/railways that are covered in vegetation and usually planted with hedgerows and trees. They have been built as mitigation measures usually to guide larger mammals, such as deer, safely across wide roads or railways. A study in Germany found 10 bat species using eight green bridges to fly over a road and also to forage (Bach & Müller-Stiess 2005). However, the study has not been summarised here as it did not provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control, or the proportion of bats not using the green bridges. The study described below reports the proportion of bats that are either using a green bridge to cross the road safely or are crossing the road below at risk of collisions with traffic.\nBach L. & Müller-Stiess H.
