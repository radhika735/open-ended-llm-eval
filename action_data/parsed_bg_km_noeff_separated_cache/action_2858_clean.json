  "action_title": "Vaccinate against disease",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of vaccinating against disease on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVaccinating marine and freshwater mammals against disease could reduce the spread of disease. However, vaccinating wild mammals can be challenging, due to difficulties in administering vaccines in appropriate doses and on a large scale. Vaccination is only likely to be attempted in certain cases, such as when mammals may be affected by a zoonotic disease that could spread to humans, or when particularly endangered mammal populations are threatened.\nSee also Treat disease in wild marine and freshwater mammals."
