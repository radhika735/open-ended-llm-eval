  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Indonesia found that adding coarse woody debris to forest floors had no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance, but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species. One before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations.\nTwo studies (including one replicated study) in New Zealand and the USA found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRefuge habitats can provide amphibians with microclimates to keep them at the correct temperature and prevent them from dehydrating and can protect them from predation. Many amphibians seek shelter in rocks, logs or other refuges created by tree falls and other disturbances. Refuges can be created for amphibians where natural shelter habitat is limited, or to replace these habitats where they have been lost.\nOther studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in ‘Create artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites’ and ‘Biological resource use – Leave coarse woody debris in forests’."
