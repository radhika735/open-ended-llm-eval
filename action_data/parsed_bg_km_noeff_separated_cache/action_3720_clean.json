  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial refuges, hibernacula and aestivation sites on reptile populations. Three studies were in each of the UK and Australia, two were in New Zealand and one was in each of the USA, Spain and Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that areas with refuge logs had higher reptile species richness than areas without refuges.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in Spain found that areas with refuge logs had a higher abundance of reptiles than areas without refuges.\nReproductive success (1 study): One study in the UK found that after translocating adders to an artificial hibernaculum, there was evidence of successful reproduction.\nSurvival (1 study): One randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in New Zealand found that in areas with artificial refuges, survival of McCann’s skinks was similar to areas without refuges.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)\n\nUse (9 studies): Nine studies (including one replicated, controlled study and one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Italy found that artificial refuges were used by reptiles, common lizards, adders, common geckos, species of skinks, and by an ocellated lizard to lay a clutch of eggs. Four of the studies also found that some reptiles showed a preference for refuges with certain designs or construction materials.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReptiles need shelter for overwintering or aestivating during hot arid summers. Artificial overwintering or aestivating sites, or ‘hibernacula’, can be created for reptiles where natural sites are limited or where these habitats have been lost, for example at newly restored sites or in gardens.\nOther studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in Add woody debris to landscapes; Create artificial burrows; Create or restore rock outcrops; Threat: Biological resource use – Leave woody debris in forests after logging and Leave standing/deadwood snags in forests."
