  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of removing mid-storey vegetation in forest. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that after removing mid-storey vegetation, mammal species richness increased.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that after removing mid-storey vegetation, mammal abundance increased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThrough fire suppression, some forest areas have developed denser mid-storey vegetation (trees at intermediate height between the ground layer and the forest canopy) than was formerly the case. To reduce wildfire risk and for habitat restoration purposes, mid-storey vegetation may be removed either mechanically or through prescribed burning. This intervention considered specifically manual or mechanical removal of mid-storey vegetation and how this may affect forest mammals.\nSee also: Use prescribed burning."
