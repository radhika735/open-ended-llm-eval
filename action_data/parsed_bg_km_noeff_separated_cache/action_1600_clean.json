  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo before-and-after studies in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over 1–7 years, despite being fostered to survive in the wild, alongside other interventions but in one study they reproduced successfully which partly compensated mortality.\nTwo before-and-after studies in Liberia and Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees that were fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions, survived over 1-3.5 years. One before-and-after study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements despite being fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions.\nOne controlled study in Indonesia found that reintroduced orangutans that were fostered natural behaviour, alongside other interventions, did not act more like wild orangutans than individuals that were not fostered. One study in Indonesia found that reintroduced orangutans that were fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions, fed on fewer plant species and spent more time building nests.\nOne site comparison study in Vietnam found that all reintroduced pygmy slow lorises were assumed dead despite being fostered natural behaviour prior to release, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the context of this primate synopsis, fostering refers to promoting behaviour in primates by human care-takers likely to increase their chance of survival post-reintroduction to the wild. Behaviours that may be included here are foraging on natural foods, hunting, climbing and other locomotive behaviours, building nests, grooming and other social behaviours, etc."
