  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of excluding bats from roosts during maintenance work at road/railway bridges and culverts on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTemporarily excluding bats from roosts within bridges or culverts during maintenance work may prevent injury or death. However, it is important to also consider the short-term and long-term impacts of exclusion from roosts on the survival and productivity of bat populations. It may be necessary to provide alternative roosting locations during exclusion. See ‘Provide alternative bat roosts during maintenance work at road/railway bridges and culverts’."
