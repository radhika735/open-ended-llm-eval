  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of installing physical barriers to prevent trawling in a protected area on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in the South China Sea (Hong Kong).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nWorm community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the South China Sea found that sites in a protected area where physical barriers were installed to prevent trawling had a different community composition of nematode worms compared to nearby unprotected fished sites, after up to two years.\nWorm species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the South China Sea found that sites in a protected area where physical barriers were installed to prevent trawling had similar diversity and species richness of nematode worms to nearby unprotected fished sites, after up to two years.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the South China Sea found that sites in a protected area where physical barriers were installed to prevent trawling had fewer small invertebrates compared to nearby unprotected fished sites, after up to two years.\nWorm abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the South China Sea found that sites in a protected area where physical barriers were installed to prevent trawling had fewer nematode worms compared to nearby unprotected fished sites, after up to two years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Some habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows, are particularly vulnerable to trawling gears. Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities (Kelleher 1999). In marine protected areas where trawling is prohibited, physical barriers, such as concrete blocks or other artificial reefs, can be placed to ensure no illegal trawling takes place, as such physical barriers would damage trawl nets (Liu et al. 2011).\nWhen this intervention occurs outside of a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Install physical barriers to prevent illegal trawling”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs”.\n \nCollie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. & Poiner I.R.
