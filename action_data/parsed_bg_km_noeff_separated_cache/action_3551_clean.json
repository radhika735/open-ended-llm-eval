  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of limiting the length of fishing gear or density of traps in an area.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLimiting the length of fishing gear (e.g. ropes, lines, nets) or the number of traps in an area may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch(‘bycatch’) of aquatic reptiles. This could involve using shorter ropes or lines, or using multiple pots, traps or nets on each line.\nSee also: Limit the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area and Reduce duration of time fishing gear is in the water."
