  "action_title": "Freeze semen for use in artificial insemination",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small controlled trial in the USA found that using frozen semen for artificial insemination resulted in lower fertility in falcons, and a second small trial from the USA found that an American kestrel Falco sparverius had only 33% fertility when inseminated with frozen semen.\nA small trial from the USA found that fertility rates were highest when semen contained 10% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, a cryoprotectant), compared to semen containing 6% or 8% DMSO.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpermatozoa only survive for a short time and so if artificial insemination is not going to happen immediately, the semen must be frozen. This in itself can damage cells, so a cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulphoxide or glycerol must be added to protect the cells. Some cyroprotectants (e.g. glycerol) must then be removed by dialysis before insemination."
