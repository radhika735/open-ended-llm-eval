  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing land under power lines for butterflies and moths. Two studies were in each of the USA and Finland, and one was in each of the UK and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Finland found that land under power lines managed by mechanical cutting had a higher species richness of butterflies than unmanaged land, and butterfly species richness was highest 2–4 years after scrub and trees were cleared. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that the species richness of butterflies was similar under power lines and on road verges mown once or twice a year, or left unmown.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Finland and Canada found that land under power lines managed by mechanical cutting had a higher abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land. The other study found that land under power lines and on road verges managed by mowing had a lower abundance of pearl crescent and northern pearl crescent butterflies, and a similar abundance of other butterflies, to those left unmown. Two of three site comparison studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA, the UK and Finland found that the time since management under power lines did not affect the abundance of Karner blue butterflies or small pearl-bordered fritillaries, but chequered skipper abundance was higher in areas cleared ≤2 years ago than in areas cut ≥4 years earlier. The other study found that power lines cleared of trees and scrub 2–4 years earlier had a higher abundance of butterflies than power lines cleared 1 year or 6–8 years earlier. Two site comparison studies in the USA found that land under power lines managed by cutting or herbicide application, and by mowing or cutting, had a similar abundance of Karner blue butterflies and six other butterfly species, but the abundance of frosted elfin was higher under power lines managed by mowing than those managed by cutting.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK reported that pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas under power lines where scrub had been cleared one or two years earlier, but not under power lines cleared three or more years ago.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLand under power lines offers a number of conservation opportunities. Management must maintain early successional habitats by suppressing the growth of woody species, to prevent interference with the electric lines. This could have benefits for butterflies and moths, which often favour these lightly disturbed habitats (Forrester et al. 2005). In addition, by running across the landscape, power lines may provide connectivity between other patches of suitable habitat. However, the methods used to control vegetation – primarily herbicide application or cutting – may affect the quality of the habitat created (Smallidge et al. 1996), while the frequency of management may be important for maintaining stretches of habitat in optimal conditions (Ravenscroft 2006).\nFor other studies on retaining or managing habitat connectivity along linear features, see “Restore or maintain species-rich grassland along road/railway verges” and “Habitat protection – Retain connectivity between habitat patches”.\nForrester J.A., Leopold D.J. & Hafner S.D.
