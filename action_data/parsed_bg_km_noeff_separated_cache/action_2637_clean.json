  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using selective harvesting instead of clearcutting. Four studies were in Canada, three were in the USA and one was a review of studies in North America.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that harvesting trees selectively did not result in higher small mammal species richness compared to clearcutting.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (7 studies): One of six replicated, controlled or replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada found more small mammals in selectively harvested forest stands than in fully harvested, regenerating stands. Three studies found that selective harvesting did not increase small mammal abundance relative to clearcutting. The other two studies found mixed results with one of four small mammal species being more numerous in selectively harvested stands or in selectively harvested stands only in some years. A systematic review in North American forests found that partially harvested forests had more red-backed voles but not deer mice than did clearcut forests.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that partially harvested forest was not used by snowshoe hares more than was largely clearcut forest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClearcutting of large areas of forest can have substantial impacts on associated fauna. Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to clearcutting where all trees are felled. This intervention is similar to several others that involve harvesting some, but not all, trees. In this case, tree removal was largely based on forestry specifications, rather than designed spatially to retain undisturbed patches. This intervention covers a wide range of tree removal intensities. In some cases, management is for shelterwood, a specific forestry practice that involves gradually removing mature trees to allow growing space for younger trees that initially germinate in partial shade.\nSee also Fell trees in groups, leaving surrounding forest unharvested, Retain undisturbed patches during thinning operations, Use thinning of forest instead of clearcutting and Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting."
