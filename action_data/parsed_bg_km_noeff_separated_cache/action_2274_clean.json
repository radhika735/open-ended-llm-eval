  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing size limitations for the capture of recreational species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including overharvest (Hobday et al. 2000). Populations of certain species have decline to such extent that they are now protected (Stierhoff et al. 2012), and their fishing and harvest is controlled, for instance by setting maximum and minimum limits on the size (usually correlated with age) of animals allowed to be caught (Van Poorten et al. 2013). Setting minimum size limits can protect juveniles and animals that have not yet reached sexual maturity, potentially allowing them to reach adulthood and reproduce. Setting maximum size limits can protect older mature animals, which often contribute more strongly to reproduction and population renewal (for instance older females usually produce more or bigger eggs)."
