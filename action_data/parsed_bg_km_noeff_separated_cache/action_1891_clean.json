  "action_title": "Amphibians: Manipulate humidity to improve development or survival to adulthood",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of manipulating humidity to improve development or survival to adulthood.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAmphibian larvae may be more sensitive to dry conditions than adults, due to decreased mobility affecting access to other areas. By finding a humidity level which is suitable, tadpole survival may increase."
