  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of installing physical barriers to prevent trawling on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in the Bay of Biscay (Spain).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Bay of Biscay found that one to four years after installing artificial reefs as physical barriers to prevent trawling invertebrate community composition changed.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Bay of Biscay found that one to four years after installing artificial reefs as physical barriers to prevent trawling overall invertebrate biomass increased.\nEchinoderm abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Bay of Biscay found that one to four years after installing artificial reefs as physical barriers to prevent trawling the biomass of sea urchins and starfish increased.\nMolluscs abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Bay of Biscay found that one to four years after installing artificial reefs as physical barriers to prevent trawling the biomass of gastropods (sea snails), of one species of cuttlefish, and of two species of octopus increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Some habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows, are particularly vulnerable to trawling gears. Trawling can be discouraged in certain areas through the positioning of physical barriers, such as concrete blocks or other artificial reefs, to make trawling unfeasible without damaging trawl nets (Liu et al. 2011). This may limit local trawling (and other mobile fishing) effort in the area, thereby reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of bycatch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates. When this intervention occurs within a marine protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Designate a Marine Protected Area and install physical barriers to prevent illegal trawling”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Place anthropogenic installations (e.g: windfarms) in an area such that they create artificial habitat and reduce the level of fishing activity”.\n \nCollie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. & Poiner I.R.
