  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of maintaining traditional orchards on butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar community composition of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards.\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to abandoned orchards. One controlled study in the USA found that an unmanaged and a partially managed orchard had a greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods (including caterpillars) than a commercially managed orchard.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that managed orchards had a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than abandoned orchards.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTraditional orchards, with large numbers of veteran trees and managed with no chemical inputs, can support a diverse community of invertebrates, including butterflies and moths. For example, 12% of all British butterfly and moth species were recorded in a single summer in three small, traditionally managed orchards (Smart & Winnall 2006). However, the dual threats of intensification and abandonment have led to the loss of many traditionally managed orchards. Restoring and maintaining extensive, low-input management of orchards – including pruning trees, occasional mowing or light grazing between the trees, and limiting the application of pesticides and herbicides – may benefit a large number of butterfly and moth species.\nSmart M.J. & Winnall R.A.
