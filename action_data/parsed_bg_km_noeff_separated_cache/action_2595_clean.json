  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of providing more small artificial breeding sites rather than fewer larger sites. This study was in Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in SpainÂ found that smaller artificial warrens supported higher rabbit densities than did larger artificial warrens.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhen providing artificial breeding sites for colonial mammals, there may be a trade-off between providing large sites, which may support larger, more-resilient populations at each site, or a greater number of small sites, which may increase the chance of at least some sites surviving threats such as predation or disease. The size of the overall population may also be influenced if the density of animals occupying these sites differs between different sized sites."
