  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally. Three studies were in the UK, two were in each of the USA and Germany, one was in each of Spain, Mexico and Switzerland, and one was a systematic review across Europe.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (10 studies): Eight studies (including one replicated study, two controlled studies, one randomized study, five site comparison studies, and one systematic review) in the USA, Europe, the UK, Spain, Mexico and Switzerland found that orchards, crop edges, farms, vineyards, replanted Douglas fir stands, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer or unspecified chemical input (sometimes along with other agri-environment scheme options or less intensive management) had a greater species richness of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars (in one case along with other leaf-eating arthropods), than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. However, one of these studies found that species richness was not affected by the number of pesticide applications in the year of study, only in the previous three years, and another of the studies also found that vineyards managed with reduced insecticide and herbicide application had a similar species richness of moths to conventionally managed vineyards. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK and Germany found that unfertilized grassland had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths, but greater species richness of specialist moths, to fertilized grassland.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (9 studies): Six studies (including one replicated study, one controlled study, one randomized study, four site comparison studies, and one systematic review) in Europe, the UK, Germany, Mexico and Switzerland found that crop edges, farms, a hay meadow, coffee plantations and agricultural landscapes managed with less frequent, reduced or no pesticide, insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, fertilizer or unspecified chemical input (sometimes along with other agri-environment scheme options or less intensive management) had a higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, or caterpillars, than areas with more frequent or conventional chemical applications. However, one of these studies found that abundance was not affected by the number of pesticide applications in the year of study, only in the previous three years, and another of these studies also found that a hay meadow with no herbicide applications had a similar abundance of caterpillars to a meadow where herbicide was used, and a meadow with no fertilizer applications had a lower abundance of caterpillars than a meadow where fertilizer was applied in one of two sampling sessions. Three replicated studies (including two randomized, controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the UK, Germany and the USA found that unfertilized grassland and replanted Douglas fir stands with limited or no herbicide applications had a similar abundance of adult butterflies and caterpillars, and adult moths, to fertilized grassland and stands with more herbicide applications.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that unfertilized or lightly fertilized grasslands were preferred to heavily fertilized grasslands by 7 out of 58 species of moth, but 12 of 58 species preferred more heavily fertilized grasslands.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn conventional farming or plantation management, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control or fertilization, but these can have lethal or sub-lethal effects on other wildlife, including butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010, Schultz et al. 2016). Therefore, reducing the extent, amount or frequency of chemical application may benefit butterfly and moth populations.\nThis action includes studies where there has been a general reduction in the use of multiple or unnamed chemicals, either without complete cessation or over a small area. For studies on the reduction or cessation in use of a specific, named chemical, see “Restrict certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals”. For studies on restricting chemical applications on field edges, see “Leave headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands)”. For studies on the complete cessation of chemical applications across an entire farm, see “Convert to organic farming”. For studies on the reduction of chemical application as part of a general reduction in grassland management intensity, see “Agriculture and aquaculture – Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”.\nRussell C. & Schultz C.B.
