  "action_id": "993",
  "action_title": "Retain veteran and standing dead trees as roosting sites for bats",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining veteran and standing dead trees on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVeteran or damaged trees (of any age and size) and standing dead trees (‘snags’) can provide important roosting sites for bats within crevices, cavities and behind loose bark.\nTo be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared areas where veteran and standing dead trees have been kept as roosting sites for bats with similar/nearby areas where they have been removed. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the trees and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.\nFor an intervention that involves creating roost features in trees, see ‘Create artificial hollows and cracks in trees for roosting bats’. See also ‘Create or restore bat foraging habitat in urban areas’ for one study that uses snag recruitment alongside other practices for forest restoration."
