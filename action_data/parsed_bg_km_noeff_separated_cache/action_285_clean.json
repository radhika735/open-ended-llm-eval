  "action_title": "Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA total of eight studies and two literature reviews from coastal and pelagic fisheries across the world found strong evidence for reduced seabird bycatch on longlines when streamer lines were used.  \nA replicated, controlled trial from the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean found no reduction in bycatch rates when using streamer lines, whilst five studies were inconclusive, uncontrolled or had weak evidence for reductions. \nThe effect of streamer lines appears to vary between seabird species: northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis were consistently caught at lower rates when streamers were used but shearwaters Puffinus spp. and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were caught at similar rates with and without streamers in one study each.\nThe three studies that investigated the use of multiple streamer lines all found that fewer birds were caught when two streamer lines were used, compared to one, with even fewer caught when three were used.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStreamer lines are long lines attached to a high point on the stern of a fishing boat so that they fall slowly to the surface of the water. On the 25 m or so of the lines, multiple ‘streamers’ are attached: strands of often brightly coloured line attached on a swivel to the main line. These move in the wind and interfere with birds attempting to reach the baited longline below. Streamer lines can vary in effectiveness with design, and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and some other fisheries organisations have specific recommendations on their design. For example, boats in CCAMLR fishing areas must use a line at least 150 m long, attached 4.5 m above the water, with five sets of streamers attached at 5 m interval (Miller et al. 2003).\nMultiple streamer lines may also be more effective than a single streamer, and how the streamer is deployed is thought to be important: if the wind moves the streamer so it is not directly over the longline then it is unlikely to have an effect.\nMiller, D.G.M., Sabourenkov, E.N. and Ramm, D.C.
