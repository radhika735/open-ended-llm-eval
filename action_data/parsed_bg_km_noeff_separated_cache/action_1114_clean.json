  "action_title": "Asian clams: Change pH of the water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the use of pH adjustment to control Asian clams.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe ability of Asian clams Corbicula spp. to lay down their calcium-rich shells will be reduced in more acidic (lower pH) conditions.Â  Molluscs are rarely found in waters with a pH of less than 6.0-6.5 and the use of acid dosing to lower pH has been used to effectively control other invasive bivalves (Claudi et al. 2012).\nClaudi R., Graves A., Taraborelli A.C., Prescott R.J. & Mastitsky E. (2012) Impact of pH on survival and settlement of dreissenid mussels. Aquatic Invasions, 7, 21-28."
