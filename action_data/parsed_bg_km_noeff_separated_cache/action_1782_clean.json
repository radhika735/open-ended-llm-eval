  "action_id": "1782",
  "action_title": "Use artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial barriers such as sand bags, rocks, plastic curtains, absorbent matting or ditches could be used to separate peatlands from a pollution source. Barriers could prevent pollution from reaching the peatland entirely, or slow it down so it has more time to break down before reaching the peatland. These barriers are likely to be most effective as a short-term intervention to extreme pollution events e.g. oil or chemical spills (Zoltai & Kershaw 1995).\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: retain or create vegetated buffer zones between pollution source and peatland.\nZoltai S.C. & Kershaw G.P.
