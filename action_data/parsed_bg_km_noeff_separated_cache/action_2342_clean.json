  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of treating mammals to reduce conflict caused by disease transmission to humans. This study was in Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after study in GermanyÂ found that following a worming programme, proportions of red foxes infested with small fox tapeworm fell.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOutbreaks of diseases that can be spread between animals and humans (zoonotic diseases) may result in calls for lethal control of the relevant carrier species. Motivations for lethal control may be reduced if the prevalence of diseases or parasites can be reduced by carrying out treatments in wild populations. This intervention specifically considers ways of reducing the risk of disease transmission to humans rather than ways of reducing the direct impact of disease on wild mammal populations."
