  "action_title": "Set lines underwater to reduce seabird bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour replicated and controlled studies and a literature review in Norway, South Africa and the North Pacific found reductions in northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, albatross and petrel bycatch rates when using an underwater setting funnel. Although one found a disproportionate number of albatross were caught during day line setting.\nA replicated and controlled study found that underwater setting increased attack rates of shearwaters Puffinus spp. on longlines and did not reduce bycatch.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMost birds caught on longlines are caught when the lines are being set, after the bait has been attached to hooks but before they have sunk out of the reach of surface-feeding birds. If lines are set underwater then it may reduce the time they are available to birds and therefore reduce bycatch."
