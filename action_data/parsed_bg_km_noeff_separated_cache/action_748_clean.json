  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in establishment of one of three translocated populations of natterjack toads. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that species-specific habitat management that included adding limestone to ponds increased natterjack toad populations.\nOne before-and-after study in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds temporarily increased breeding by natterjack toads. Three before-and-after studies (including one controlled, replicated study) in the Netherlands and UK found that adding limestone increased larval and/or egg survival of moor frogs and common frogs and resulted in metamorphosis of natterjack toads at two of three sites.\nTwo before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in the UK found that adding limestone to ponds resulted in high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment by natterjack toads and higher numbers of abnormal common frog eggs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWater bodies can become acidified from atmospheric pollution that includes sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which fall as acid rain. Polluted water, from mines for example, can also enter water bodies changing the acidity. This can have significant effects on amphibian abundance, diversity and reproduction (Leuven et al. 1986). Adding lime (calcium and magnesium-rich minerals) to water bodies can help reduce acidity.\nLeuven, R. S. E. W., den Hartog C., Christiaans, M. M. C. & Heijligers, W. H. C. (1986). Effects of water acidification on the distribution pattern and the reproductive success of amphibians. Experientia, 42, 495â€“503."
