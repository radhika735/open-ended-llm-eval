  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of grazing mammalian herbivores on pasture, instead of sustaining with artificial foods. This study was in South Africa.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): A site comparison study in South AfricaÂ found that a population of roan antelope grazed on pasture had a higher population growth rate than populations provided solely with imported feed.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn highly managed populations of wild mammalian herbivores, locations of enclosures or other constraining features can determine what food is available for animals. Some populations may be maintained on food imported from elsewhere. However, making pasture available might provide a higher quality diet than can be offered with imported food and this might have positive effects on the population."
