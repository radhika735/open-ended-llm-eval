  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThirteen studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting on sea turtle populations. Five studies were in the USA, two were in Suriname and the US Virgin Islands and one was in each of Costa Rica, Ascension Island, Brazil and Cape Verde.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (12 studies): Four of 12 controlled studies (including three replicated, randomized studies) in the USA, Suriname, US Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Ascension Island, Brazil and Cape Verde found that relocated sea turtle nests had lower hatching success than natural nests in six of seven years, in 26 of 29 years, or lower hatching success than nests laid above the tidal zone, or that nests relocated &gt;10 days after being laid had lower hatching and emergence success than natural nests or nests relocated within 12 hours. One of those studies also found that relocating nests within 12 hours had mixed effects on hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One study also found that two different egg collecting methods resulted in either more dead early stage or late-stage embryos. Four of the studies found that relocated sea turtle nests had similar hatching and emergence success or hatching success compared to natural nests and specifically compared to those laid in safer parts of the beach or above the high tide line. One of those studies also found that relocated nests experienced similar levels of predation by ghost crabs as natural nests. One of the studies also found that fewer relocated nests failed completely due to tidal flooding compared to natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated loggerhead turtle nests had higher hatching success than natural nests. One of the studies found that relocated leatherback turtle nests had higher hatching success compared to natural nests that were washed over by sea swells, but similar hatching success compared to natural nests that were not washed over by sea swells. The other two studies found that relocating sea turtle nests had mixed effects on hatching or hatching and emergence success compared to natural nests. One of those studies also found that in years when leatherback turtle nests were relocated, fewer were lost to erosion than when no relocations took place.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that hatchlings from relocated loggerhead turtle nests were a similar size to hatchlings from natural nests.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nOffspring sex ratio (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Suriname found that relocated leatherback turtle nests produced all female hatchlings, whereas 30–100% of hatchlings from naturally incubated nests were female.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReptile nests/eggs may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an alternative suitable natural setting where the threat is lower or non-existent. Consideration must be given to the potential impacts of different environmental conditions in the destination location (for example temperature and humidity) on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006).\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.\nThis action does not include studies on the effect of relocating nests/eggs to on-beach hatcheries, which are designated locations on a beach that are often fenced and patrolled, and where larger numbers of nests/eggs tend to be reburied at relatively high densities. Studies on the effect of moving eggs to on-beach hatcheries are discussed in Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery.\nFor studies on the effect of relocating eggs into artificial settings, including in polystyrene boxes and other containers, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation.\nDepending on the threat to nests, practitioners may consider other actions such as Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Protect nests and nesting sites from predation and Threat: Biological resource use – Patrol or monitor nesting beaches.\nSee also: Alter incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratio.\nBooth D.T.
