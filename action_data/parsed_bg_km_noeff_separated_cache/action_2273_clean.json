  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting recreational catch quotas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including overharvest (Hobday et al. 2000). Populations of certain species have decline to such extent that they are now protected, and their fishing and harvest is controlled and/or illegal (Stierhoff et al. 2012). Recreational fishing and harvest quotas (such as Total Allowable Catch) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources (species stocks). Catch quotas are limits, expressed for instance in weight or numbers of animals, that one person or vessel is allowed to fish or harvest over a certain period. Setting catch quotas for specific species, particularly those declining or endangered, can potentially reduce the pressure from fishing and harvesting, and allow the species to recover over time (Lewis 2015).\nRelated evidence is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set commercial catch quotas”.\n \nHobday A.J., Tegner M.J. & Haaker P.L.
