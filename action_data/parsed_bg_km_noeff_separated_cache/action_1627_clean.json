  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne systematic review of three studies in lowland heathland in North Western Europe found that mowing did not alter heather abundance relative to grass abundance. A site comparison in Italy found that mowing increased heather cover. Two replicated, randomized, before-and-after trials in Spain (one of which was controlled) found that using cutting to mimic grazing reduced heather cover.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Spain found that cutting increased the number of plant species. However, a replicated, randomized, before-and-after trial found that the number of plant species only increased in a minority of cases.\nOne replicated, randomized, before-and-after trial in Spain found that cutting to mimic grazing increased grass cover. A site comparison in Italy found that mowing increased grass cover.\nOne site comparison study in Italy found a reduction in tree cover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany shrublands depend on disturbances such as grazing to reduce succession that leads to an increase in woody plant species and conversion to forest. In addition, grazing may help to maintain plant diversity and the populations of plant species that depend on disturbance. However, in some cases grazing by livestock may no longer be economically viable and so cutting or mowing have been used to replace it. This cutting may be able to limit the growth of woody species and invasion of trees."
