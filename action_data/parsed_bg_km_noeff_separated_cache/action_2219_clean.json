  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n     We found no studies that evaluated the effects of transplanting captive-bred or hatchery-reared individuals of habitat-forming/biogenic species that are resistant to climate change on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany marine species are vulnerable to climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno 2010), but preserving their habitats and promoting biodiversity is thought to help improve the overall resistance of the system and help alleviate the negative effects of climate change.\nTransplanting individuals of habitat-forming (biogenic) species (such as kelp, seagrass, mussels, oysters or corals) resistant to climate change can potentially provide a climate-resistant habitat for associated species (van Oppen et al. 2015). These climate-resistant strains or families could be developed for instance through selective breeding or genetic modification (van Oppen et al. 2015). For instance, transplanting individuals of climate-resistant strains of reef-building oysters (Parker et al. 2011) grown in a hatchery may help create an oyster reef that will be resilient to climate change and beneficial to associated subtidal benthic invertebrates.\nEvidence related to the transplantation of individuals outside of the context of climate change are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”.\n \nHoegh-Guldberg O. & Bruno J.F.
