  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTen studies evaluated the effects on mammals of install rope bridges between canopies. Eight studies were in Australia, one was in Brazil and one in Peru.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A study in Australia found that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not suffer high predation rates when doing so.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)\n\nUse (9 studies): Nine studies (including three replicated studies and a site comparison), in Australia, Brazil and Peru found that rope bridges were used by a range of mammals. Seven of these studies found between three and 25 species using rope bridges, one found that that they were used by squirrel gliders and one that they were used by mountain brushtail possums and common ringtail possums but not by koalas and squirrel gliders. One of the studies found that crossing rates were higher over the canopy bridges than at ground level.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWildlife crossings over or under roads may be installed to reduce the impact of the road on animal mortality and on habitat fragmentation. They usually take the form of tunnels or bridges of a range of designs. These may not be suitable for use by mammals that spend most of their time higher up within trees. Rope bridges have been trialled, especially in Australia, to provide a means of reconnecting habitat and reducing road mortality for arboreal mammal species. Monitoring typically takes the form of documenting use of crossings rather than looking at population level effects or impacts on road mortality.\nSee also: Install pole crossings for gliders/flying squirrels."
