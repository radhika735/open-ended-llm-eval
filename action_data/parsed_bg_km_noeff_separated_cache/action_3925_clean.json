  "action_title": "Plant crops in spring rather than autumn",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting crops in spring rather than autumn.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSowing crops in autumn is commonly used to advance the harvest, as the crop begins to grow when sown and then overwinters as small plants in the ground. However, this head-start means that the crop flowers earlier, and may be too early to be beneficial for butterflies and moths. In addition, the disturbance to the previous year’s stubble in autumn may kill butterflies and moths of any life-stage which are overwintering within the harvested crop. Planting crops in spring may, therefore, mitigate these impacts."
