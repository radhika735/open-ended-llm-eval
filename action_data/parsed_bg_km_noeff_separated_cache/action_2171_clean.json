  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control non-native, invasive or other problematic species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Biocides are chemical substances or microorganisms used with the intention of controlling a problematic species (Fitridge et al. 2012; Thresher & Kuris 2004). Using biocides or other chemicals, such as chemical inhibitors, to reduce or control the population of non-native, invasive or other problematic species can lower the risk they pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates.\n \nBishop M.J., Krassoi F.R., McPherson R.G., Brown K.R., Summerhayes S.A., Wilkie E.M. & O’Connor W.A.
