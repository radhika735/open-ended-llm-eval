  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using conditioned taste aversion to prevent carnivorous reptiles from eating toxic invasive cane toads. Both studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies in Australia found that survival of yellow-spotted goannas subjected to conditioned taste aversion was higher at one of two sites than those that were not treated. The other study found that survival of bluetongue skinks given a high dose was higher than those given a low dose, but similar to skinks receiving no dose.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that yellow-spotted goannas subjected to conditioned taste aversion were less likely to eat cane toads than those that were not treated.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConditioned taste aversion as a conservation tool was originally developed to protect eggs and nests of birds and reptiles from predation (Maguire et al. 2010). In such cases, chemicals are placed on or near either real or artificial eggs or nests with the aim of teaching a predator population that eggs are distasteful or cause sickness. More recently, a novel use of conditioned taste aversion has been used in the case of native carnivorous reptiles and mammals eating the introduced and highly toxic cane toad Rhinella marina in Australia. In this case, conditioned taste aversion has been used with the aim of teaching the native populations that cane toads are distasteful or cause sickness and thus are not prey items. For other uses of conditioned taste aversion, see Protect nests and nesting sites from predation using conditioned taste aversion.\nMaguire G.S., Stojanovic D. & Weston M.A. (2010) Conditioned taste aversion reduces fox depredation on model eggs on beaches.
