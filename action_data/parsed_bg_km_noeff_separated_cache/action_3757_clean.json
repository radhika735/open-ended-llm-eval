  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of breeding crocodilians in captivity. Two studies were in the USA, one was in each of Venezuela, Brazil and China and one was a global review.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 studies): One study in China reported that a captive population of Chinese alligators increased from 10,000 to 15,000 individuals over a 10-year period.\nReproductive success (4 studies): Four studies in the USA, Venezuela and Brazil reported that 1–4 captive females crocodilians, including four captive-born broad-snouted caiman, produced clutches of 17–49 eggs, with hatching successes of 35–86% or 6%.\nSurvival (1 studies): One study in Brazil reported that 4% of broad-snouted caiman hatchlings died within one week\nCondition (1 studies): One global review reported on one study on Chinese alligators that found that captive breeding had a positive effect on genetic variation compared to wild populations.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for other species groups.\nFor studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild."
