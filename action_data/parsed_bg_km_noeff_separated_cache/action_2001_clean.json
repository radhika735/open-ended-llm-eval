  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of excluding domestic and feral cats from bat roosts and roost entrances on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCats can injure or kill bats and have been reported to wait at roost entrances for bats to emerge (e.g. Scrimgeour et al. 2012, Ancillotto et al. 2013). Excluding both domestic and feral cats from bat roosts and roost entrances may reduce bat mortality. For other interventions relating to cat predation, see ‘Keep domestic cats indoors at night’ and ‘Use collar-mounted devices on cats to reduce predation of bats’.\nAncillotto L., Serangeli M.T. & Russo D. (2013) Curiosity killed the bat: domestic cats as bat predators. Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde, 78, 369–373.\nScrimgeour J., Beath A. & Swanney M. (2012) Cat predation of short-tailed bats (Mystacina tuberculata rhyocobia) in Rangataua Forest, Mount Ruapehu, Central North Island, New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 39, 257–260."
