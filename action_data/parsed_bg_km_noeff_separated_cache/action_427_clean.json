  "action_title": "Reduce competition between species by providing nest boxes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated, controlled study from the USA found that providing extra nest boxes did not reduce the rate at which common starlings Sturnus vulgaris usurped northern flickers Colaptes auratus from nests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf several species are competing for nest sites then it might be possible to reduce this competition by providing a surplus of nesting sites.
