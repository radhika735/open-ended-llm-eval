  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda found that gorilla populations increased after anti-poaching guard were provided with better equipment, alongside other interventions.\nOne study in Uganda found that no gorillas were killed for 21 months after game guards were provided with better equipment, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Rwanda found that the number of immature gorillas increased and the number of snares decreased after anti-poaching patrols were supplied with better equipment, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf anti-poaching rangers are provided with better equipment (e.g. guns, or technical equipment, such as GPS, compass, hand-held data recording devices, binoculars, cameras, rain gear, etc.), they may be more effective at reducing hunting in the areas they patrol.\n            The patrolling of areas by anti-poaching teams to reduce hunting is discussed separately under ‘Conduct regular anti-poaching patrols’. The providing of training to anti-poaching patrols and the regular removal of ground snares by snare-removal teams that may form part of anti-poaching teams is discussed under ‘Provide training to anti-poaching ranger patrols’ and ‘Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares’. The use of monitoring surveillance strategies and/or monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols is discussed under ‘Implement monitoring surveillance strategies (e.g. SMART) or use monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols’."
