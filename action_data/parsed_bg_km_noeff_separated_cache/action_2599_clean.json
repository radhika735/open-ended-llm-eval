  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying vegetation along roads to reduce collisions with mammals by enhancing visibility for drivers.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCollisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions can be employed to in an attempt to reduce the animal-vehicle collision rate. One option may be to cut back vegetation along roadsides in areas with high collision rates. This could give motorists a clearer sight of animals at the roadside ahead and, hence, more chance to take avoiding action if they see an animal moving onto the road.\nConover M.R., Pitt W.C., Kessler K.K., DuBow T.J. & Sanborn W.A.
