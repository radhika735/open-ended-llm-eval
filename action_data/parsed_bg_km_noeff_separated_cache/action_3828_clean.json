  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing gear exchange programmes on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGear exchange programmes aim to remove and replace what may be considered as more destructive, less selective, or even illegal fishing gears. They typically involve financial help and incentives for fishers, particularly those with low income or in poverty. Gear exchange programmes may reduce unwanted catch by providing more selective gears to reduce fish mortality, damage to fish habitats and the impacts of illegal fishing (Signa et al. 2008).\nSigna D., Tuda P. & Samoilys M.
