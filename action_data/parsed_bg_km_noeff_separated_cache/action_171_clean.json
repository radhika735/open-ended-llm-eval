  "action_title": "Increase the proportion of natural/semi-natural vegetation in the farmed landscape",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf four studies captured, one, a replicated and controlled paired sites study from Australia, found that farms with plantings of native vegetation held more species than those without. The effect was smaller than that explained by variation in the amount of natural habitat remaining on farms. A replicated study from Switzerland found more species in areas under the Ecological Compensation Area scheme than areas not under it.\nA before-and-after study from Switzerland found that the populations of three bird species increased after an increase in the amount of land under the Ecological Compensation Scheme. This study found that three species were more found more than expected on Ecological Compensation Scheme land. Another replicated study from Switzerland found that some habitats held more birds if they were close to ECA habitat but that the amount of Ecological Compensation Scheme in an area had no impact on population densities.\nA small study from the UK found no effect of habitat creation on grey partridge populations.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention is concerned with general increases in the proportion of natural or semi-natural habitat in a landscape. Studies describing the effects of the creation of specific habitat types and the use of individual restored sites are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’."
