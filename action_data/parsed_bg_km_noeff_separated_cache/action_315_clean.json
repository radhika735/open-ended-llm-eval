  "action_title": "Habituate birds to human visitors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated, controlled study from Australia found that bridled terns Sterna anaethetus in heavily disturbed had similar or higher reproductive success compared with less-disturbed sites, possibly suggesting that habituation had occurred.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDisturbance may well be more damaging to birds that are not use to humans. Therefore, habituating birds to the presence of human visitors may decrease nest abandonment or mortality, or increase reproductive success."
