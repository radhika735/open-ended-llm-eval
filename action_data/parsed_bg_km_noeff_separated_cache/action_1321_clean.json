  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated and before-and-after studies in the USAÂ and Ireland, found that when food was presented in ice, feeding time increased and inactivity decreased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhole pieces of food can be lightly frozen or frozen within juice and introduced to primates as a novelty.
