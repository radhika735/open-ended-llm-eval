  "action_title": "Detect & report dead primates and clinically determine their cause of death to avoid disease transmission",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over five years when dead chimpanzees were examined to determine their cause of death, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in French Guiana found that most translocated white-faced sakis survived over four months when dead sakis were examined to determine their cause of death, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Madagascar found that most black-and-white ruffed lemurs did not survive over five years despite the fact that dead lemurs were clinically examined to determine their cause of death, alongside other interventions.\nOne controlled, before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that the population size of mountain gorillas where dead animals were examined to determine the cause of death, alongside other interventions, increased by 168% over 41 years.\nOne before-and-after, site comparison study in Congo and Gabon found that most western lowland gorillas survived over four years when dead individuals were examined to determine their cause of death, alongside other interventions.\nTwo studies, including a before-and-after, in Vietnam and Indonesia found that most reintroduced pygmy slow lorises either died or disappeared despite the fact that dead lorises were examined to determine their cause of death, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention entails that dead primates are detected in the field, clinically examined, and their cause of death reported. This information may serve as an early warning system to prevent/minimize disease transmission to other primates in the population by e.g. isolating infected or dead individuals or by allowing management to medically intervene. The intervention is important in cases where primates contract highly infectious and life-threatening diseases."
