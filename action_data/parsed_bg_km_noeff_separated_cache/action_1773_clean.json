  "action_title": "Use grazing to control problematic plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using grazing to control problematic plants. N.B. Grazing in different contexts is considered in separate actions here, here and here.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers using grazing vertebrates (e.g. sheep or cows) to control problematic plants. Grazers remove shoots or flowers, limiting plant growth and/or reproduction. They might selectively graze certain plant groups or species (Grant et al. 1987), creating space for other species to grow. Caution: Trampling, erosion and nutrient enrichment from grazers can have negative impacts on peatlands, especially if the density of grazers is high.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: interventions to address domestic livestock as a threat, such as exclusion; grazing to manage plants as part of a traditional disturbance regime.\nGrant S.A., Suckling S.A., Smith H.K., Torvell L., Forbes T.D.A. & Hodgson J. (1987). Comparative studies of diet selection by sheep and cattle: blanket bog and heather moor. Journal of Ecology, 75, 947–960."
