  "action_title": "Enhance soil compaction",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled) in Canada and the USAÂ found that soil compaction decreased tree regeneration height and density. Two of the studies found it increased understory plant cover and density, while one found it decreased understory plant species richness.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoil compaction affects soil microclimatic conditions and nutrient availability. This can affect species composition by giving an advantage to early successional understory species."
