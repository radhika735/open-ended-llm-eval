  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Australia found that retaining native vegetation corridors maintained populations of eight of 13 frog species over 20 years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of amphibian populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas of habitat, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. On a smaller scale, amphibians often occupy two distinct types of habitat, aquatic and terrestrial. They therefore require suitable habitat to enable them to migrate between these different areas. A study found that as the amount of connecting habitat decreased, so did the diversity of amphibian species with aquatic larvae (Becker et al. 2007). Retaining corridors of native vegetation between suitable habitat patches may help to maintain amphibian populations. \nStudies investigating the effect of restoring connectivity are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Restore habitat connectivity’ and ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’.\nBecker C.G., Fonseca C.R., Haddad C.F.B., Batista R.F. & Prado P.I.
