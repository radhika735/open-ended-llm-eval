  "action_title": "Amend the soil with organic processing wastes or their composts",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo controlled, replicated trials from Spain and the United Kingdom (one also randomized) measured the effect of adding composts to soil. One trial found applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss, but increased nutrient loss. One trial found improved nutrient retention and increased barley Hordeum vulgare yield when molasses were added.\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: sandy-clay, sandy loam, silty-clay.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCotton gin compost is compost made from the stalks, leaves and seed pods of cotton plants. These are discarded as ‘gin waste,’ hence the name. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability is the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied."
