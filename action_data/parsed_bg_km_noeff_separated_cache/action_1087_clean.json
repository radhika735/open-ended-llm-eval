  "action_title": "Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Biological control using predatory fish",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the use of predatory fish to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredatory fish could potentially be used to biologically control invasive shrimp.Â  A study from Lake Constance, which borders Germany, Switzerland and Austria, found that the arrival of the invasive Ponto-Caspian killer shrimp Dikerogammarus villosus led to several fish species in the lake changing their diet (Eckmann et al. 2008). Burbot Lota lota, European eel Anguilla anguilla and Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis all fed on the killer shrimp (Eckmann et al. 2008).\nEckmann R., Mortl M., Baumgartner D., Berron C., Fischer P., Schleuter D. & Weber A. (2008) Consumption of amphipods by littoral fish after the replacement of native Gammarus roeseli by invasive Dikerogammarus villosus in Lake Constance. Aquatic Invasions, 3, 187-191."
