  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of using marketing strategies to increase the value of marshes or swamps. The study was in Vietnam.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nHuman behaviour (1 study): One before-and-after study in Vietnam reported that helping local people to sell handicrafts made from marsh plants in tourist markets (along with training to improve the quality of those products) increased their income.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action includes various specific actions that could increase the value of marshes/swamp or their products through marketing, advertising, branding or certification schemes. For example, in Kenya, certification of Nyando Wetland honey by the Kenya Bureau of Standards added credibility to the brand and increased demand (Raburu et al. 2012). In theory, this action could strengthen economic arguments to protect marshes and swamps. Increasing the value of products could also reduce the amount of habitat that must be used to provide a sustainable income, or even encourage creation of new habitat areas. Creating an emblem or brand for a marsh or swamp could directly generate income through licensing (e.g. for use on clothing), and indirectly increase the value of the site for tourism (van der Duim & Henkens 2007; Chellan et al. 2013).\nCaution: Marketing could also have negative effects on marshes and swamps. For example, if marsh or swamp products become more valuable, there may be greater incentive for people to harvest or exploit these habitats.\nTo be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the marketing is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).\nRelated actions: Designate protected area, including areas that allow sustainable use of marshes or swamps.                                                           \nChellan N., Mtshali M. & Khan S.
