  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of modifying the number of hooks between floats on longlines on reptile populations. This study was in the Atlantic and North Pacific.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch (1 study): One replicated study in the Atlantic and North Pacific found that having fewer hooks between floats did not reduce turtle by-catch in the Pacific but had mixed effects in the Atlantic depending on the species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing more floats on a longline per hook alters the profile of the longline in the water, which may reduce the opportunities for sea turtles swimming below the surface to become entangled in the line or caught on the hooks.\nFor studies looking at the effects of different hook designs, see Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks, Use non-offset hooks, Use non-ringed hooks and Use larger hooks."
