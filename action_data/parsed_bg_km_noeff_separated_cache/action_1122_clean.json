Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn order to minimize the transport of clams by humans, measures should be taken such as the education of fishermen in not using Asian clams Corbicula spp. as bait outside invaded places (Aldridge & Müller 2001) and the possibility of small specimens hitchhiking in their clothes and boats.  Caution should be taken in not transferring sand or gravel from invaded locations (Counts 1986).\nAldridge D.C. & Müller S.J. (2001) The Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, in Britain: current status and potential threats. Journal of Conchology, 37, 177-184\nCounts C.L.
