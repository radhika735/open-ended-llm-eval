  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all fishing activity in a marine protected area with limited exceptions on marine fish populations. One study was in each of the Pacific Ocean (USA), the Caribbean Sea (US Virgin Islands), the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and the Skagerrak (Norway).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that in marine protected areas closed to all fishing with limited exceptions for up to seven years, there was lower total fish species richness compared to unprotected areas.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean found that abundance of copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, china rockfish and lingcod was similar between non-voluntary and voluntary ‘no-take’ reserve sites where all fishing with limited exceptions had been prohibited for one to eight years, and sites open to fishing. One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that restricting all fishing activity except for bait fishing in marine protected areas for seven years resulted in similar total fish biomass and lower total fish density, compared to unprotected areas.\n\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Skagerrak found that cod survival increased inside a marine protected area in the eight years after almost all fishing was prohibited, compared to outside areas fished with a wider range of gear types.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in the Great Barrier Reef found that immature pigeye sharks and adult spottail sharks were detected frequently and over long time periods inside marine protected areas five years after prohibiting almost all fishing except restricted line fishing and bait netting, thus reducing the overall likelihood of fishing mortality.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine Protected Areas are designations for marine sites in which fish (and other marine animals and habitats) conservation can be promoted through management of the fishing activity and other human activities. Many protected areas are ‘no-take’ areas in which no harvesting or collection of marine organisms is permitted by any method. However, some may prohibit almost all harvesting but permit very limited fishing activity (i.e. only one type of harvest activity and/or target species), typically those that are considered to be more selective and have no impact on the bottom habitat. depending on the purpose and the characteristics of the species or habitats intended to be conserved. Ceasing or prohibiting almost all fishing activity may benefit previously impacted populations by allowing them to recover from the effects of fishing over time, whilst allowing the limited use of other resources in the protected area or for it to be used for a specific purpose with potentially little or no impact.\nEvidence for similar interventions relating to prohibiting human activity, including fishing, in marine protected areas is summarized under ‘Cease or prohibit all types of fishing in a marine protected area’, ‘Control human activity in a marine protected with a zonation system of restrictions’ and ‘Restrict fishing activity (types unspecified) in a marine protected area’."
