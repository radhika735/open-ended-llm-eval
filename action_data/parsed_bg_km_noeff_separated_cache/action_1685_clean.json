  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo randomized, replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that removal of topsoil did not increase heather cover or cover of heathland species. However, one controlled study in the UK found an increase in heather cover.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil increased the cover of both specialist and generalist plant species, but did not increase species richness.\nOne randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removal of topsoil increased cover of annual grasses but led to a decrease in the cover of perennial grasses. One controlled study in the UK found that removal of turf reduced cover of wavy hair grass.\nOne controlled, before-and-after trial in the UK found that stripping surface layers of soil increased the cover of gorse and sheep’s sorrel as well as the number of plant species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStripping topsoil may help to reduce fertility of soils as well as removing seeds that are found in topsoil. Both of these outcomes may aid the establishment of shrubland plants."
