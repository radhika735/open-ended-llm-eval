  "action_title": "Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations. However, a second study in Taiwan found that payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat.\nOne replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAgri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practice to be more favourable to biodiversity and landscape. In Europe, agri-environment schemes are an integral part of the European Common Agricultural Policy and Member States devise their own agri-environment prescriptions to suit their agricultural economies and environmental contexts.\nFinancial incentives to undertake specific management actions with the aim of increasing biodiversity on farmland may also be provided by governmental departments or non-governmental organisations.\nPayments to farmers can be provided for many different specific interventions, and where a studyâ€™s results can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, they also appear in the appropriate section. This section includes evidence about the success of the actions for amphibian populations following payments."
