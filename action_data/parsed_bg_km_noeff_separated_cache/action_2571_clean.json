  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFifty-five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing and underpasses along roads. Twenty-seven were in the USA, nine were in Canada, seven were in Australia, two each were in Spain, Portugal, the UK and Sweden, one each was in Denmark, Germany and Croatia and one was a review covering Australia, Europe and North America.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (15 studies): Eleven of 15 studies (including 12 before-and-after studies and two site comparisons), in the USA, Australia, Sweden and Canada, found that installing underpasses and associated roadside barrier fencing reduced collisions between vehicles and mammals. Three studies found that the roadkill rate was not reduced and one study found that vehicle-mammal collisions continued to occur after installation.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (52 STUDIES)\n\nUse (52 studies): Seventeen of 18 studies (including 10 before-and-after studies) in the USA, Canada and Sweden, which reported exclusively on ungulates, found that underpasses installed along with roadside barrier fencing were used by a range of ungulate species. These were mule deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, white-tailed deer, elk, moose and Florida Key deer. The other study found that underpasses were not used by moose whilst one of the studies that did report use by ungulates further reported that they were not used by white-tailed deer. Further observations from these studies included that elk preferred more open, shorter underpasses to those that were enclosed or longer, underpass use was not affected by traffic levels and that mule deer used underpasses less than they used overpasses. Thirty-four studies (including four before-and-after studies, seven replicated studies, three site comparisons and two reviews), in the USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Croatia and across multiple continents, that either studied mammals other than ungulates or multiple species including ungulates, found that underpasses in areas with roadside fencing were used by mammals. Among these studies, one found that small culverts were used by mice and voles more than were larger underpasses, one found that bandicoots used underpasses less after they were lengthened and one found that culverts were used by grizzly bears less often than were overpasses.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSchemes designed to reduce collisions between vehicles and wild mammals may use multiple interventions. Two of the most common ones, installing barrier fencing and providing routes for mammals to travel underneath roads, are often employed within the same scheme. This may entail regular roadside fencing with entrances to underpasses set further back away from the road or fencing may be designed to adjoin the sides of underpass entrances. Sometimes, fencing may be installed to form a funnel leading towards underpass entrances.\nThis intervention includes studies where these two actions are in place at the same site. In most studies, all underpasses (where there are multiple crossings) are beneath stretches or roads that have barrier fencing. In a minority, just some of the underpasses monitored are along stretches with barrier fencing. Studies included use of either conventional fencing, electric fences or other barriers, such as walls. Most studies report solely on the use of crossings or trends in numbers of mammals killed on roads. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.\nSee Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads for studies where underpasses are either installed without use of barrier fencing or where it is not clear from the study that barrier fencing was installed. See also Install barrier fencing along roads for studies which, in some cases, included underpasses but where the specific effect of fencing was evaluated."
