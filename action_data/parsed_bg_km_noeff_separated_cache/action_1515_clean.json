  "action_title": "Resettle illegal human communities (i.e. in a protected area) to another location",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne review on mountain gorillas in Uganda found that no more gorillas were killed after illegal settlers were relocated from the area, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over five years after human communities were resettled, from the protected area alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe resettlement of people from existing or newly-established protected areas to increase protection of the habitat and the species living in it, is inherently political and hotly debated (Adams & Hutton 2007). The intervention is based on the notion that settlements and the actions of the people living in these settlements threaten the integrity of the natural area that is under protection. Therefore, the intervention involves moving the people from inside the protected area to the outside. Examples of resettled communities include the people from the Nechasar National Park in southern Ethiopia, before handing the area over to the African Parks Foundation, displacements in Korup National Park, Cameroon, through a progressive resettlement scheme of the Ekundukundu Village, or the eviction of Bushmen from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (Adams & Hutton 2007).\n \nAdams W.M. & Hutton J.
