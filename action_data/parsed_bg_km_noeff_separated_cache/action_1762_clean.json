  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance. All four studies were in fens or fen meadows. N.B. Grazing in peatlands with no history of disturbance is considered as a separate action.\nPlant community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that the overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows.\nCharacteristic plants (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in Germany reported that the abundance of bog/fen-characteristic plants was similar in grazed and ungrazed fen meadows. One replicated before-and-after study in a fen in the UK reported that cover of fen-characteristic mosses did not change after grazers were introduced. One replicated, paired, site comparison study, also in Germany, found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species than mown meadows.\nHerb cover (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies in fens in the UK reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants). One of the studies found that grazing reduced purple moor grass cover, but the other found that grazing typically had no effect.\nMoss cover (2 studies): One replicated before-and-after study in a fen in the UK reported that cover of fen-characteristic mosses did not change after grazers were introduced. One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the UK found that grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover.\nTree/shrub cover (2 studies): Of two before-and-after studies in fens in the UK, one found that grazing reduced shrub cover but the other found that grazing typically had no effect on shrub cover.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (3 studies): Of two before-and-after studies in fens in the UK, one found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated but the other reported that there was typically no effect. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer plant species than mown meadows.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRegular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in fen meadows and some fens (Middleton 2012). Disturbance can clear dominant plants such as trees and shrubs, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels. This can favour a plant community rich in plant species and/or peatland characteristic species. Therefore, conservationists may sometimes want to actively maintain or restore disturbance. Grazing by large vertebrates (e.g. sheep or cows) could be one way to do this.\nGrazing itself may be the disturbance that has been reduced. Some peatlands have been historically grazed, usually at low intensities. Over the last 60 years many have been abandoned, especially those in remote areas (Middleton et al. 2006).\nCaution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance, but many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. Careful management of grazing (e.g. species used, density, timing) may be necessary.\nRelated actions: use grazing to control problematic plants whose growth is not attributed to loss of traditional management; reduce intensity of grazing; change type of livestock; change season/timing of grazing.\nMiddleton B., Holsten B. & van Diggelen R.
