  "action_title": "Amphibians: Manipulate quality and quantity of enclosure lighting to improve development or survival to adulthood",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of manipulating quality and quantity of lighting to improve development or survival to adulthood.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBy providing adequate light levels during the development period of amphibians, skeletal deformities, which result from metabolic bone disease, could be avoided, increasing survival and improving health."
