  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf 13 studies, one from the USA which used several interventions found higher species richness in managed sites. Three studies from the USA and the UK found no differences between thinned and control sites.\nSeven studies from the USA and Sweden found that total bird abundance, or that of some species, were higher in thinned plots than control plots or those under different management. Four of these used other interventions as well. Five studies found that abundances were similar, or that some species were less abundant in areas with thinning.\nTwo studies from the USA found no effect of thinning on wood thrushes, a species thought to be sensitive to it. A controlled before-and-after study found that more nests were in nest boxes in a thinned site, compared to a control site.\nA replicated randomised, controlled study in the USA found no differences in bird abundances between burned sites with high-retention thinning, compared to low-retention.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning of trees (i.e. removal of, trees to reduce density) may be undertaken as a timber management practice e.g. within forestry plantations where saplings may be planted at unnaturally high densities, or as a deliberate conservation management practice to reinstate more natural open woodland conditions that have been lost due to active fire suppression and/or loss of populations large mammal grazers and browsers. Whilst mechanical thinning may be aimed at benefitting certain target species (flora or fauna), impacts on non-target species inevitably occur.\nMany studies (especially in pine forests and savannas) simultaneously thin forests whilst introducing a prescribed fire regime. These studies are described in detail in ‘Use prescribed burning’."
