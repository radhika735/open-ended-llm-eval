  "action_title": "Use herbicide and remove leaf litter to control bracken",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne randomized, controlled study in the UKÂ found that using herbicide and removing leaf litter did not increase total plant biomass after eight years. The same study found that for three of six years, heather biomass was higher in areas where herbicide was sprayed and leaf litter was removed than in areas that were sprayed with herbicide.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nApplying herbicide to bracken may help to control it and removing leaf litter may help to create bare ground, thus allowing heathland plants to become established."
