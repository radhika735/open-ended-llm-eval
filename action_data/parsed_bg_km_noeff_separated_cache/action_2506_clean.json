  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of using target species scent to deter crop damage to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in South Africa.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that African elephants were not deterred from feeding by the presence of secretions from elephant temporal glands.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals often mark their territories with scent. If artificially placed scents from the same species can restrict movements of animals, this may assist in reducing damage to crops. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals."
