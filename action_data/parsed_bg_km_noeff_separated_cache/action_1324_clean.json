  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the USAÂ found that when smaller crowds were present foraging and object use in chimpanzees increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCrowd levels within zoos vary. At some zoos crowds could consist of up to hundreds of people at an enclosure at any one time. This can affect the behaviour of captive primates. The aim of presenting feeds at different crowd levels is to see when is best (high or low crowd levels) to give food to increase foraging time."
