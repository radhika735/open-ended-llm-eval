  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of increasing the size of a protected area. This study was in South Africa.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A before-and-after study in South Africa found that expanding a fenced reserve resulted in the home range of a reintroduced group of lions becoming larger but the core range becoming smaller.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge protected areas may be better able to support viable populations of mammals than are smaller areas. However, protected area effectiveness may also be linked to sites being surrounded by similar habitat, having strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities and sufficient financial resources (Struhsaker et al. 2005). Where these are not in place, factors such as activities of surrounding human populations may have a greater impact on species survival (Parks & Harcourt 2002).\nParks S.A, & Harcourt A.H. (2002) Reserve size, local human density, and mammalian extinctions in U.S. protected areas. Conservation Biology, 16, 800–808.\nStruhsaker T.T., Struhsaker P.J. & Siex K.S. (2005) Conserving Africa’s rain forests: problems in protected areas and possible solutions. Biological Conservation, 123, 45–54."
