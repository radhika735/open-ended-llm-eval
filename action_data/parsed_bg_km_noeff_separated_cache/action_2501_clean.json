This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study the USA found that after the control of red imported fire ants, capture rates of northern pygmy mice increased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native invertebrates can affect mammals in a number of ways. Alterations to habitats and predation on other species could reduce feeding resources available to mammals and, in some cases, direct predation on mammals can occur (Masser & Grant 1986). Such effects can lead to mammals avoiding areas occupied by non-native invertebrates (Killion & Grant 1993). Control of such species may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these impacts.\nMasser M.P. & Grant W.E. (1986) Fire ant-induced trap mortality of small mammals in east-central Texas. The Southwestern Naturalist, 31, 540–542.\nKillion M.J. & Grant W.E. (1993) Scale effects in assessing the impact of imported fire ants on small mammals. The Southwestern Naturalist, 38, 393–396."
