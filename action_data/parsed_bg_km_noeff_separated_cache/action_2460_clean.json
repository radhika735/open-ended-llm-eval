  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTen studies evaluated the effects of using loud noises to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Three studies were in the USA, two were in Zimbabwe and Kenya and one each was in the UK, Namibia, and India.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (10 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (10 studies): Five of six studies (including two controlled, one replicated and two before-and-after studies), in the USA, Namibia, Kenya and India, found that loud noises activated when an animal was in the vicinity reduced or partially reduced crop damage or crop visits by white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer (when combined with using electric shock collars) and elephants. The other study found that using loud noises (along with chili fences and chili smoke) did not reduce crop-raiding by African elephants. Three studies (including two controlled studies), in the UK and the USA, found that regularly sounding loud noises did not repel European rabbits or white-tailed deer. Two replicated studies, in Zimbabwe, found that, from among a range of deterrents, African elephants were repelled faster from crop fields when scared by firecrackers or by a combination of deterrents that included drums.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention specifically refers to use of sound, from various sources, to deter visits by wild mammals into crops. If successful, such an intervention could reduce crop damage and, thus, reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of herbivores.\nSee also: Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict, Use noise aversive conditioning to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflictÂ and Use ultrasonic noises to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
