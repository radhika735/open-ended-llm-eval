  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on reptiles of establishing handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled reptiles. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Canada in a captive setting found that recovery of painted turtles after a long period of being held underwater was similar when turtles recovered out of the water or in the water.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEstablishing and implementing best practice protocols for handling and releasing aquatic reptiles entangled or captured in fishing gear may reduce the risk of injury and improve post-release survival. This may involve releasing reptiles with or without delay, using appropriate techniques to remove fishing gear from entangled or hooked reptiles, and using appropriate procedures to release reptiles caught in nets.\nFor studies on the effect of releasing rehabilitated or accidentally captured (‘bycatch’) reptiles see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals."
