  "action_title": "Use patch retention instead of clearcutting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effect of retaining patches of trees rather than clearcutting on amphibian populations.\nOne replicated study in Canada found that although released red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, large patches were selected more and moved out of less than small patches.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPatch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests exploited for timber. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species."
