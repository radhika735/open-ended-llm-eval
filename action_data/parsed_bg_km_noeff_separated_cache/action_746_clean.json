  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that excluding livestock from streams or ponds did not increase numbers of amphibian species or overall abundance, but did increase larval abundance and abundance of green frog metamorphs. Two studies found that the abundance of green frogs and/or American toads was higher with grazing.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs. One before-and-after study in the UK found that pond restoration that included livestock exclusion increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLivestock grazing can have significant effects on aquatic habitats through disturbance, trampling, erosion, reduced water quality and changes in vegetation structure and composition. Such changes may have detrimental effects on amphibian populations. However, grazing can also have beneficial effects on amphibians and their habitats. For example, a study found that three years after excluding livestock grazing by fencing, ungrazed temporary pools dried 50 days earlier than grazed pools (Pyke & Marty 2005). Other studies investigating the effects of grazing on amphibians are discussed in ‘Manage grazing regime’.\nPyke C.R. & Marty J. (2005) Cattle grazing mediates climate change impacts on ephemeral wetlands. Conservation Biology, 19, 1619–1625."
