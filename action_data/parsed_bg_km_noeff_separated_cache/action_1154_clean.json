Watering increased or had no effect on seedling emergence depending on habitat and water availability.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWatering seedlings can relieve drought stress in young trees and may therefore enhance their survival and growth. However, it may also enhance growth of undesired competing plants."
