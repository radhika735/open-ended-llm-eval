  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effect on reptile populations of releasing reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that for plains gartersnakes released as newborns, two of over 350 released snakes were found to be gravid two years after release.\nSurvival (5 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that survival of captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings was similar over six months compared to hatchlings that were head-started in indoor or outdoor enclosures. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that alligator hatchlings released into their mother’s home range had higher survival than those released outside her home range. Three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia and the USA found that 11% of Murray short-necked turtles and 7% of plains gartersnakes survived for 1–3 years after release, and first year survival of gopher tortoise hatchlings released into a predator proof enclosure was around 30%.\nCondition (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the USA found that captive-born desert tortoises released as hatchlings grew more slowly over six months than hatchlings head-started in an indoor enclosure. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found mixed effects on growth of alligator hatchlings released inside or outside of their mother’s home range compared to wild hatchlings.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn some circumstances, it may be desirable to release hatchlings born in captivity from wild-collected eggs or wild-caught females soon after hatching/birth, rather than rearing them in captivity (see Head-start wild-caught reptiles).\nThis action includes studies that discuss the outcomes for hatchlings after they have been released. For studies that discuss the effects of relocating eggs or nests for artificial incubation, or relocating nests to on beach hatcheries, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation; Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries) and Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery."
