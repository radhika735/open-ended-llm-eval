  "action_title": "Set longlines at night to reduce seabird bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix out of eight studies from fisheries around the world found lower rates of seabird bycatch on longlines set at night, compared with during the day, or with previously collected data. However, effects seemed to depend on the species caught.\nTwo studies found higher rates of bycatch on night-set longlines, due to high numbers of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis or northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis being caught at night.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMost seabirds feed during the day and so longlines set at night may catch fewer birds. Some species, however, do hunt at night and so night-setting is unlikely to be an effective mitigation measure. An adequate knowledge of bycatch speciesâ€™ ecology is therefore important in determining whether to promote night-setting.\nMany of the studies in this section do not explicitly say whether night-setting was done for conservation purposes or not. However, given the valuable information they contain, we have included them below."
