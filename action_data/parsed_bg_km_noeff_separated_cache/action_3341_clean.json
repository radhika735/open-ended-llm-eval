  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using moisture-retaining peat pots when planting emergent, non-woody vegetation in freshwater wetlands. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that tussock sedge Carex stricta cover was similar across plots, after two growing seasons, whether sedges were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nIndividual plant size (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that the biomass of tussock sedge Carex stricta plants was similar, after two growing seasons, whether they were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that the survival rate of tussock sedge Carex stricta plants was similar, after two growing seasons, whether they were planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil.\nGrowth (1 study): The same study found that the growth rate of tussock sedge Carex stricta was typically similar, over two growing seasons, when planted into peat pots or into existing wetland soil. However, in a dry area and in a dry year, planting in peat pots did increase the growth rate.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPots made from compressed peat can retain moisture during dry periods, which may improve survival or growth rates of planted marsh or swamp plants. Focal plants could be grown in peat pots in nurseries then planted with the pot in the field. Alternatively, peat pots could be inserted into the soil before planting. Caution: Extracting peat to produce peat pots could damage natural peatlands."
