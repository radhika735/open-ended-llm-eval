  "action_title": "Foster eggs or chicks of gannets and boobies with wild conspecifics",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA small controlled study in Australia found that Australasian gannet chicks Morus serrator were lighter, and hatching and fledging success lower in nests which had an additional egg or chick added. However, overall productivity was (non-significantly) higher in experimental nests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNatural variations in reproductive output can be detrimental when populations are very small, for example if pairs fail to produce fertile eggs or some pairs repeatedly fail to raise offspring successfully. One way to minimise this problem is to foster eggs and chicks between nests. Eggs and chicks from nests with more offspring than they are likely to be able to raise can be moved to those with infertile eggs. Alternatively, if a pair produces fertile eggs or healthy chicks but consistently fails to raise chicks then it may be possible to transfer offspring to a more successful pair.\nIn other circumstances it may be possible to foster chicks with other species (‘cross-fostering’). Studies describing this intervention are discussed in the following section ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering).’"
