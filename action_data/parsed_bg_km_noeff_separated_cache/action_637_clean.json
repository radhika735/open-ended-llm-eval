  "action_title": "Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA review from Pakistan and a small trial from Saudi Arabia found that pheasants and bustards had higher survival after release, when given pre-release predator training, compared to birds without training, many of which were predated.\nThe Saudi Arabian study found that introducing a model fox (as opposed to a live predator) to cages did not increase post-release survival. Introducing a live fox to the cage increased post-release survival more than other techniques used.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf individuals have been raised in captivity, it is unlikely that they will have encountered predators and, in consequence, may have lost some of their innate fear leaving them vulnerable after release. Using predators under controlled conditions can therefore teach them to avoid dangerous species and potentially increase post-release survival."
