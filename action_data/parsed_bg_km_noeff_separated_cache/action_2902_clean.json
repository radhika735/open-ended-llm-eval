  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the use of sonars on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSonar (sound navigation and ranging) may be used for military, civil and scientific applications to navigate, communicate or detect objects underwater. Research suggests that the use of active sonar can have behavioural and physiological effects on marine mammals and can lead to mass stranding events (Frantzis 1998, Jepson et al. 2003, Parsons 2017). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the use of underwater sonar may reduce these negative impacts.\nFrantzis A. (1998) Does acoustic testing strand whales?
