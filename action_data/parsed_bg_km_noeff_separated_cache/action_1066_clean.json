  "action_id": "1066",
  "action_title": "Ponto-Caspian gobies:  Netting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the use of seine netting to control goby populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGill netting and seine netting provide a potential tool for localised population reduction of invasive gobies. Studies have shown this to be effective for other fish species.Â  For example, a before-and-after study in the UK found repeated removal of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva by seine netting reduced pond and lake populations (Britton et al. 2010).\nBritton J. R., Davies G.D. & Brazier M. (2010) Towards the successful control of the invasive Pseudorasbora parva in the UK. Biological Invasions, 10, 125-131."
