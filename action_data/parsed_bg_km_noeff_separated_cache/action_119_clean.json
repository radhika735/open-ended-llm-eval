  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf three studies from Sweden and the UK (two before-and-after trials) looking at bird numbers or densities following water meadow restoration, one study found increases, one study found increases and decreases and one found northern lapwing populations did not increase despite an increase in the area of managed water meadows. \nSeventeen studies from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the UK (seven replicated controlled studies of which two were also randomized and two reviews) found one or more management techniques that were successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities. The techniques were topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing or a combination of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species, plus livestock exclusion. Three studies (one replicated controlled study and two reviews) from the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and the UK found restoration of wet meadow plant communities had reduced or limited success.\nThirteen studies (five replicated and controlled of which two randomized) from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK monitored the effects of methods to restore or create wet meadow plant communities over a relatively short time period after restoration, and found some positive effects within five years. Three replicated studies (one controlled, one a site comparison) from the Netherlands and Germany found restoration was not complete five, nine or 20 years later. A replicated controlled site comparison from Sweden found plant species richness increased with time since restoration.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves restoring or creating traditional water meadows, also known as wet meadows. Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for wading birds and other biodiversity.\nTechniques used to restore or create plant communities associated with wet meadows may include topsoil removal, which rapidly reduces nutrient levels in nutrient-enriched soils and increases flooding frequency by lowering the ground surface (Hölzel & Otte 2003). In areas where target plant species are not present in the seed bank or plant species have limited dispersal, it may also be important to introduce plant species through sowing, planting or spreading hay from existing wet meadows (Hölzel & Otte 2003).\nSee also ‘Raise water levels in ditches or grassland’ for studies looking at the effects of raising water levels on grassland.\nHölzel N. & Otte A. (2003) Restoration of a species-rich flood meadow by topsoil removal and diaspore transfer with plant material. Applied Vegetation Science, 6, 131-140."
