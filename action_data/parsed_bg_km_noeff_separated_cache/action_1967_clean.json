  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of creating spaces for roosting bats in road bridges. The study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)         \n\nUse (1 study): One review in the USA found that spaces created in road bridges for roosting bats to replace those lost during bridge works were recolonized by bats in similar or greater numbers to the original roosts at four of eight sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBackground\nBridges and culverts can provide roosting opportunities for bats. Suitable roosting spaces, such as crevices or chambers, can be incorporated into the design of new bridges and culverts, or can be retrofitted to existing structures (e.g. by adding wood strips or panels; see Keeley & Tuttle 1999).\nFor a similar intervention see ‘Maintain bat roosts in road/railway bridges and culverts’. For evidence relating to the use of bat boxes under bridges, see ‘Provide bat boxes for roosting bats’.\nKeeley B.W. & Tuttle M. (1999) Bats in American bridges.
