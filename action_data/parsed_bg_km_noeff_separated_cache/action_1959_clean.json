  "action_title": "Paint turbines to reduce insect attraction",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of painting turbines to reduce insect attraction on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere is evidence that bats actively feed on insects around wind turbines (e.g. Foo et al. 2017). Common turbine colours (white and grey) have been found to attract more insects than other colours, such as purple (Long et al. 2011). Painting turbines in colours that are less attractive to insects could reduce bat foraging activity and subsequent fatalities.\nFoo C.F., Bennett V.J., Hale A.M., Korstian J.M., Schildt A.J. & Williams D.A. (2017) Increasing evidence that bats actively forage at wind turbines. PeerJ, 5, e3985.\nLong C.V., Flint J.A. & Lepper P.A. (2011) Insect attraction to wind turbines: does colour play a role? European Journal of Wildlife Research, 57, 323–331."
