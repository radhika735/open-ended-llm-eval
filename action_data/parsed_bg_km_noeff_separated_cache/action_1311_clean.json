  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the impact of education programmes on control of Crassula helmsii.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nC. helmsii can easily be dispersed between water bodies via a variety of management and recreational activities. Public education about the species and the need to decontaminate equipment could reduce the spread of C. helmsii from ornamental ponds and aquaria, and between natural water bodies. Direct sales of the species were banned in the UK in 2014."
