  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing or enforcing legislation to prevent ponds and streams from being contaminated by toxins on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nContamination of ponds and streams by toxins can reduce the availability of prey and cause the build-up of toxins in the food chain. Toxic heavy metals have been found in high concentrations in bats (Zukal et al. 2015), although little is known about the long-term impacts.\nZukal J., Pikula J. & Bandouchova H. (2015) Bats as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution: history and prospect. Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde, 80, 220–227."
