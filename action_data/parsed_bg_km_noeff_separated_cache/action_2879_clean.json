  "action_id": "2879",
  "action_title": "Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nChemicals are often used in agriculture, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. They are designed to have long-lasting effects on living organisms, are often toxic to non-target species, and as such are a major source of pollution and toxicity in aquatic environments (Jepson et al. 2016). Agricultural run-off, including excess nutrients and toxic substances, can reach rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers in agriculture may reduce pollution levels and associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.\nJepson P.D., Deaville R., Barber J.L., Aguilar À., Borrell A., Murphy S., Barry J., Brownlow A., Barnett J., Berrow S., Cunningham A.A., Davison N.J., ten Doeschate M., Esteban R., Ferreira M., Foote A.D., Genov T., Giménez J., Loveridge J., Llavona Á., Martin V., Maxwell D.L., Papachlimitzou A., Penrose R., Perkins M.W., Smith B., de Stephanis R., Tregenza N., Verborgh P., Fernandez A. & Law R.J.
