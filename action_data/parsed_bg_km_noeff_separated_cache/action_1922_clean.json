  "action_id": "1922",
  "action_title": "Carnivores: Present food in/on water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effects of presenting food in/on water on captive carnivores.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany species of carnivore, particularly bears, hunt or forage in water. Many countries have regulations against feeding live vertebrate animals, including fish, to predatory species in captivity. Therefore, providing food in or floating on water aims to simulate a wild-type situation, encouraging natural foraging and hunting behaviours."
