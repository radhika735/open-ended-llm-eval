  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals to reduce overpopulation. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that adult elk numbers approximately halved after the translocation of wolves to the reserve.\nReproductive success (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that elk calf:cow ratios approximately halved after the translocation of wolves to the reserve.\nSurvival (2 studies): A study in Australia found that koalas translocated to reduce overpopulation had lower survival than individuals in the source population. A study in the USA found that following translocation to reduce over-abundance, white-tailed deer had lower survival rates compared to non-translocated deer at the recipient site.\nOccupancy/range (1 study): A study in the USA found that following translocation to reduce over-abundance at the source site, white-tailed deer had similar home range sizes compared to non-translocated deer at the recipient site.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOverpopulation can reduce the long-term persistence of a population, as competition for resources increases. Translocating individuals of the target species away from the area or predators into the area for example, to reduce population numbers may help reduce competition for resources and thus improve the fitness of the remaining population."
