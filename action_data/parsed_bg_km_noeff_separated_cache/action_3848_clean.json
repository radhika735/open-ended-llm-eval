  "action_title": "Increase consideration of butterflies and moths in international, national and local conservation plans",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of increasing the consideration of butterflies and moths in international, national and local conservation plans.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConservation planning, particularly at higher levels, traditionally focuses on charismatic vertebrate species. Despite being among the best studied and widely recognized invertebrates, explicit conservation plans for butterflies, and particularly moths, remain rare. The inclusion of butterflies and moths in conservation plans may help to raise awareness of the species, which may be important for stimulating research into their requirements, or funds for the protection and management of important sites for their conservation (Parsons 2004).\nParsons M.S. (2004) The United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan moths - selection, status and progress on conservation. Journal of Insect Conservation, 8, 95–107."
