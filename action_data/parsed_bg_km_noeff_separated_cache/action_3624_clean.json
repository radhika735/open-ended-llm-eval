  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of releasing accidentally caught reptiles. One study was in each of the Caribbean Sea, Costa Rica and the Republic of Korea.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated study in the Caribbean Sea found that from a released group of green turtles that included some accidentally caught and some head-started individuals, some survived for at least several months in the wild. One replicated study in the Republic of Korea found that green turtles caught in pound nets all survived for at least two weeks to a year after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One controlled study off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica found that the behaviour of longline-caught sea turtles following release was broadly similar to free-swimming turtles.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAfter reptiles have become caught in nets or traps, or hooked on lines, it may be possible to rehabilitate and release individuals depending on the extent or severity of any injuries incurred. Ideally rehabilitation and releases would follow established best practice guidelines to maximise survival rates and ensure each individual is sufficiently healthy prior to release. \nFor studies that test different methods for safely releasing accidentally captured reptiles, see also Establish handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled (‘bycatch’) reptiles. For studies where injured reptiles were rehabilitated prior to release, see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals."
