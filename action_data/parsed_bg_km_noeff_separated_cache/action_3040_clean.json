  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of active water level management in freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study of a swamp/marsh in the USA found that overall plant diversity was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One site comparison study of floodplain swamps in the USA found that an artificial flood had no significant effect on tree seedling density in a low and very wet swamp, but increased tree seedling density in a drier swamp higher on the floodplain.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study of a swamp/marsh in the USA reported mixed responses of individual plant species’ cover to active water level management. However, the study found that cover of the dominant woody species, Pacific willow Salix lucida, was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves active, repeated management of the amount of water in wetlands and when it is present, to mimic the natural hydrology of swamps. This may prevent excessively high or low water levels (e.g. during storm surges or droughts), or maintain wet/dry cycles that are a natural feature of many swamps (e.g. Conner & Buford 1998).\nThis action will usually involve some kind of water control structure: a valve, gate, sluice or pump. Water level management might aim to: mirror historical water level fluctuations or stability; manage salinity levels; increase sediment inputs; stimulate growth of desirable plant species; and/or create new wetland plant communities. Studies of “moist soil management”, “structural marsh management” and “environmental flows” along river courses all fall within the scope of this action. Caution: When managing water levels in a focal site, the effect on water levels in neighbouring sites should be considered.\nAlthough water levels may be managed to restore or enhance habitats for waterfowl, information on the value of vegetation for waterfowl (e.g. seed production; productivity measured as CO2 exchange rates) is not summarized in this synopsis. Also, this synopsis does not include information on riparian areas that are not clearly marshes or swamps (e.g. riparian forests that require only a brief flood pulse for germination; Taylor et al. 2006).\nRelated actions: Raise water level to restore degraded swamps or restore/create swamps from other land uses; Lower water level to restore degraded swamps or restore/create swamps from other land uses; Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded swamps or restore/create swamps from other land uses; Manage water level to control problematic plants; Actively manage water level to complement planting.\nConner W.H. & Buford M.A. (1998) Southern deepwater swamps.
