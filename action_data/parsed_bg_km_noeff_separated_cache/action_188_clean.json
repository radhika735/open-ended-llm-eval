  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study from the UK found an increase in tern numbers after the erection of an electric fence, whilst a study from the USA found an increase in the number of nests.\nFive studies from the USA found higher survival or productivity at wader or seabird colonies with electric fencing, compared to areas without fencing, although one study found that hatching rates were no different, whilst nesting success was only higher in one of two years.\nOne study from the USA found lower predation by mammalian predators inside electric fence exclosures, whilst predation by birds was higher.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFor fencing to be effective it has to physically prevent predators from entering an area, which is likely to be very difficult for species such as racoons Procyon lotor. Electric fences may offer a solution as animals will be unlikely to attempt to climb through them after receiving electric shocks."
