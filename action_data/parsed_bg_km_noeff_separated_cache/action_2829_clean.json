  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of establishing handling and release protocols for mammals captured by wild fisheries. The study was in the Great Australian Bight (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found that introducing a code of conduct for releasing dolphins trapped in nets, along with avoiding dolphins during fishing, resulted in lower mortality of short-beaked common dolphins.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEstablishing best practice protocols for handling and releasing marine and freshwater mammals entangled or captured in fishing gear may reduce the risk of injury and improve post-release survival. This may involve releasing mammals without delay, using appropriate techniques to remove fishing gear from entangled or hooked mammals, and using appropriate procedures to release mammals encircled in nets. See also Provide training and tools for safe release of mammals captured by fisheries.\nFor an intervention related to releasing mammals from derelict fishing gear, see Remove derelict fishing gear from mammals found entangled."
