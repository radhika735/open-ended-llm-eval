  "action_title": "Maintain or restore hedges",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of maintaining or restoring of hedges on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHedgerows can provide valuable migration corridors for wildlife, particularly in disturbed landscapes. For example, newts migrating away from breeding ponds were found to use hedgerows more than expected within a pastoral landscape (Jehle & Arntzen 2000).\nJehle, R. & Arntzen, J.W. (2000). Post-breeding migrations of newts (Triturus cristatus and T. marmoratus) with contrasting ecological requirements. Journal of Zoology, 251, 297â€“306."
