  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in Malaysia found that a population of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years despite staff and volunteers having received medical checks, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and Congo found that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while sick/unwell researchers and visitors were not allowed to visit gorillas, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of travellers at wildlife sanctuaries/ecotourism sites may be ill, potentially infectious and not protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses, creating unnecessary risk of pathogen transmission to the primates that are housed/live there (Muehlenbein et al. 2008, Muehlenbein et al. 2010). This intervention aims to prevent the spread of viral and bacterial diseases from humans to primates and can be implemented in situations where humans regularly come into close contact with primates, such as when researchers or tourists observe habituated primates in their natural habitat.\n            Other means of preventing the spread of bacterial and viral diseases from researchers/tourists/managers to primates are discussed under ‘Wear face-masks to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates’, ‘Keep safety distance to habituated animals’, ‘Limit time that researchers/tourists are allowed to spend with habituated animals’, ‘Implement quarantine for people arriving at, and leaving the site’, ‘Regularly disinfect clothes, boots etc.’, and ‘Wear gloves when handling primate food, tool items, etc.’.\n \nMuehlenbein M.P., Martinez L.A., Lemke A.A., Ambu L., Nathan S., Alsisto S., Andau P. & Sakong R.
