  "action_id": "1842",
  "action_title": "Protect or prepare vegetation before planting (other interventions)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting or preparing peatland vegetation before planting (other than by adding root-associated fungi).\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe handling of plants before planting can affect their germination, survival or growth rates. This section considers the effects of treatments applied to seedlings, seeds or other planted material before planting. For example, plant roots might be dipped in a substance to keep them moist during transportation to a site. Plants might be treated with hormones before planting to stimulate their growth. Seed germination rates might be improved by stratification (exposing seeds to a period of chilling) or scarification (damaging the seed coating to allow water to enter the seed).\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: add root-associated fungi to plants before planting."
