  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated laboratory study in Italy found that exposing male red swamp crayfish to X-rays reduced the number of offspring they produced by 43%.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSterilisation of males which are allowed to remain in wild populations can help to reduce the rate of population increase.  For example, a review study from the UK (Stebbing et al. 2012) reported that removal of pleopods used by males to deposit spermatophores onto the females led to a population decrease over a three year period.\nStebbing P.D., Longshaw M., Taylor N., Norman R., Lintott R., Pearce F. & Scott A.
