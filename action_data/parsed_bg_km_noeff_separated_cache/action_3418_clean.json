  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of applying herbicide before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one study was in each of Germany and the UK.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)\n\nSown/planted species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that applying herbicide before sowing seeds increased sown species richness.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased the cover of sown grass species.\nForb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that spraying with herbicide before sowing grass seeds did not alter or reduced the density of native forb species.\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that spraying with herbicide before sowing grass seeds led to an increase in the density of shrubs.\nIndividual plant species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that spraying with herbicide before sowing grass seeds did not alter the density of crested wheatgrass.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Germany found that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany degraded grasslands have few species and are dominated by grasses. In order to restore species-rich grasslands, herbicide may be applied to kill any vegetation that is present. Sowing seeds of grassland species after application of herbicide may help grassland species colonise the site more effectively. However, herbicide residues may also affect the germination and establishment of sown species.\nFor studies that remove vegetation prior to sowing or planting using mechanical methods, see ‘Remove vegetation before seeding/planting’ or for burning, see ‘Burn vegetation before seeding/planting’."
