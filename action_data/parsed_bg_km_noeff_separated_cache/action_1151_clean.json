  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in AustraliaÂ found that removing bell-miners from narrow-leaved peppermint forests did not improve the health of the trees in the forest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBirds can consume seeds or physically damage trees. However, insectivorous birds may also control invertebrate herbivore populations. Some territorial species (such as bell-miners) may also displace other insectivorous birds and hence affect the impact of invertebrates on forests."
