  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation, in habitat patches or within corridors, of retaining/creating habitat corridors in areas of energy production or mining.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat corridors are strips that link two larger habitat patches – in this case preventing peatland patches being separated by energy production or mining activities. By connecting the habitat patches, corridors could improve survival prospects of peatland plant populations. Seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can more easily move between the habitat patches (perhaps carried by animals), maintaining populations and diversity in each (Damschen et al. 2006).\nCaution: Habitat corridors can have negative effects. For example, corridors can allow diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: maintaining/creating habitat corridors across service corridors; rewetting, because peatlands may be drained directly for mining or dried out by drainage of sites nearby; habitat creation and restoration interventions.\nDamschen E.I., Haddad N.M., Orrock J.L., Tewksbury J.J. & Levey D.J. (2006) Corridors increase plant species richness at large scales. Science, 313, 1284–1286.\nResasco J., Haddad N.M., Orrock J.L., Shoemaker D., Brudvig L., Damschen E.I., Tewksbury J.J. & Levy D.J.
