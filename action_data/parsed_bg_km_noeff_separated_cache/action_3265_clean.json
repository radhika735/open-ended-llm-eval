  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing seeds of emergent, non-woody plants to brackish/saline wetlands. There were three studies in the USA, two in the Netherlands and two in China. The other study was a global systematic review.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (4 studies): Four replicated studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. One study in an estuary in China also gave a before-and-after comparison, and reported higher density and biomass of seablite Suaeda salsa five months after sowing its seeds than on the bare sediment present before sowing.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated study on a mudflat in the Netherlands reported that the average height of surviving common cordgrass Spartina anglica plants increased, between one and six months after sowing cordgrass seeds.\n\nOTHER           \n\nGermination/emergence (5 studies): Five replicated studies in the Netherlands, the USA and China quantified germination rates of seeds sown into intertidal areas. Some seeds germinated in all five studies, at a rate of &lt;1% to 25%. Two studies reported that no seeds germinated for some species and/or in some environments.\nSurvival (3 studies): One replicated study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands quantified survival rates of individual germinated seedlings: 0–83% over their first growing season, depending on species and site conditions. Another replicated study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported that after two growing seasons, common cordgrass Spartina anglica was absent from 90% of plots in which had been sown. One global systematic review reported variable survival of herbs sown (or planted) in salt marshes: 0% to ≥95% after 20 days to 13 years, depending on the study.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves introducing seeds of emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. Seeds may be collected from plants in greenhouses/laboratories, or from natural sites. They may be sown directly into the soil, scattered over the surface, or carried to suitable sites by water (e.g. after dropping them into the sea during an incoming tide).\nIntroduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. Seeds are easier to handle than plants, and can be a cost-effective way to introduce vegetation to large areas – but they can be more susceptible to herbivory or being washed away (e.g. Schoenholz et al. 2001).\nThe effects of sowing may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were seeds introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the conditions over the duration of the study?\nThe scope of this action does not include sowing nurse plants; sowing submerged or floating plants; sowing to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); or sowing facultative wetland plants in upland sites. In contrast, the scope does include sowing non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).\nRelated actions: Directly plant whole plants; Introduce vegetation fragments; Transplant or replace blocks of vegetation; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including planting.\nBrown S.C. & Bedford B.L.
