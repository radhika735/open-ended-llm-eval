  "action_title": "Remove debris from brackish/saline swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing debris from brackish/saline swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge debris (e.g. building materials, tyres) and accumulations of small debris (e.g. plant litter, wrack, plastics) can damage swamp vegetation. Debris can shade and crush vegetation. Movement of debris with water flows or tides can increase the area impacted beyond the footprint of the debris itself. Debris could also provide a refuge for animals that might damage vegetation, or release toxic chemicals (Uhrin & Schellinger 2011). Debris might be deposited directly into swamps by humans, or carried there by wind and water (e.g. storms and tsunamis; Valiela et al. 1998).\nRelated actions: Put up signs to discourage littering.\nUhrin A.V. & Schellinger J.
