  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of adding charcoal to soil before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. The study was in the Netherlands.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Netherlands found that adding charcoal to soil before sowing seeds did not alter overall plant biomass.\nGrass abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Netherlands found that adding charcoal to soil before sowing seeds did not alter grass cover.\nForb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Netherlands found that adding charcoal to soil before sowing seeds increased the cover of legumes but did not alter the cover of other forbs.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCharcoal can be added to soil to increase its fertility, carbon storage, and water retention. When charcoal is used for soil amendment it is commonly known as biochar. Charcoal has a long history of use as a fertilizer, and was used by pre-Colombian Amazonians to enhance soil productivity. Adding charcoal to soil can increase crop yield in agricultural systems (Jeffery et al. 2011), and so addition of charcoal to soil alongside seeding in grasslands may help to increase survival and growth of grassland plants.\nThe studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding charcoal to the soil before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an untreated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.\nJeffery, S., Verheijen, F.G., van der Velde, M. & Bastos, A.C.
