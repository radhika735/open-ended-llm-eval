  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from China compared plots with and without hedges and found no effect on spiders in crops. One of two studies from France and China found more natural enemies in a hedge than in adjacent crops while one study found this effect varied between crop types, hedge species and years. Two randomised, replicated, controlled studies from France and Kenya found natural enemy abundance in hedges was affected by the type of hedge shrub/tree planted and one also found this effect varied between natural enemy groups. Pests: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from Kenya compared fallow plots with and without hedges and found effects varied between nematode (roundworm) groups.\nCrops studied were barley, beans, maize and wheat.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHedges or windbreaks are lines of trees or shrubs grown along the margins of crop and pasture fields or along orchard and plantation boundaries. Growing trees in rows within fields is included under 'Use alley cropping'. Ground-dwelling invertebrates (such as ground beetles and spiders) are frequently surveyed using pitfall traps – small pots buried in the ground up to their rim and left empty or filled with liquid preservatives or water. Pitfall trap measurements relate to both the abundance of beetles and their levels of activity on the ground, therefore studies refer to ‘activity densities’.\nHere we present evidence from four of six studies."
