  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThirteen of 15 studies from across the world found that bird communities in restored forests were similar to original forests or that species returned to restored sites, that species recovered significantly better than ats unrestored site, that species richness, diversity or abundances increased over time or that restoration techniques themselves improved over time. \nNine of the studies found that some species did not return to restored sites, or were less common than in original forests.  One study also found that overall territory density decreased over time and another found that territory densities were similar between sites planted with oak Quercus spp. saplings and unplanted sites.\nOne study from the USA found that productivity of birds was similar in restored and natural forests. Another found that productivity was lower. \nA study from the USA found that fast-growing cottonwood forests less than ten years old held more territories and had higher diversity than similarly-aged oak forests.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome forests are the most complex terrestrial habitats, with countless species interacting. Restoring such complexity is difficult, but there is an ever-increasing amount of research and investment into the area. For example, insurance firms and shipping companies are financing a 25-year project to restore forest ecosystems along the Panama Canal (TEEB 2008); whilst mining companies in Australia are increasingly able to reconstruct the forests they destroyed after they have finished mining at a site (Nichols & Grant 2007).\nTrees grow slowly and therefore the effects of forest restoration may not be evident for decades or even longer after restoration begins. Care must therefore be taken when interpreting the results of these studies.\nSome studies below describe the effects of riparian forest and buffer strip creation as a habitat type. The effects of riparian buffer strips as a pollution-reducing intervention are discussed in ‘Threat: Pollution – Provide buffer strips along rivers and streams’.\nNichols, O.G. & Grant, C.D.
