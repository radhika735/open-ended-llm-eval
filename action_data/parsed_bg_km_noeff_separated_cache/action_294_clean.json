  "action_title": "Use high-visibility longlines to reduce seabird bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe captured no intervention-based evidence on the impact on seabird bycatch of high-visibility longlines.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf birds can see longlines then they may avoid them as they forage for baits, potentially reducing the risk of ‘foul hooking’ (birds being hooked through the body or wing), if not the risk of being hooked whilst taking bait."
