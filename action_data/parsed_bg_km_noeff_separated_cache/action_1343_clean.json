  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in the USA reported that an enrichment task took less time to complete when monkeys were in social groups than when feeding alone.\nOne before-and-after study in Italy found that in the presence of their groupmates monkeys ate more unfamiliar foods during the first encounter.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany primate species feed in social groups in the wild but may be housed individually in captivity either routinely (e.g. in some laboratory contexts) or temporarily (e.g. for medical treatment). Time spent feeding and foraging as a group may be important for reinforcing social structures (Brennan & Anderson, 1998) and for the development of natural feeding behaviours in young animals (Lefebvre 1995). Captive primates can be fed in social groups or given visual access to animals in other enclosures, with the aim of allowing natural group dynamics and social learning of feeding behaviours.\nBrennan, J & Anderson, J.R. (1998) Varying responses to feeding competition in a group of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Primates, 29, 353-360.\nLefebvre, L. (1995) Culturally-transmitted feeding behaviour in primates: Evidence for accelerating learning rates. Primates, 36, 227-239."
