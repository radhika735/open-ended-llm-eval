  "action_title": "Thin vegetation to prevent wild fires",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh/swamp vegetation, of thinning vegetation to prevent wild fires in or near these habitats.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFire is an important disturbance in some marshes and swamps, whether it occurs naturally (Sutter & Kral 1994) or is prescribed by humans to manage the vegetation (Middleton 2013). However, if fire becomes too frequent or intense, or occurs at the “wrong” time of year, it can cause undesirable damage to these ecosystems. Fires within marshes or swamps can directly damage the vegetation and soils (Kotze 2013). Fires in the watershed can affect the water quality in focal marshes or swamps (Pinel-Alloul et al. 2002). It is possible to manage the frequency, intensity and timing of wild fires by removing/thinning the vegetation, thereby reducing the amount of fuel available (WRC 2000).\nTo be summarized in this action, studies could have compared areas or time periods in which vegetation has been thinned (using any method, including prescribed burning, within or adjacent to focal marshes or swamps) with areas or time periods in which vegetation was not thinned and experienced wild fire. The study must have monitored the vegetation, not just properties of the fire.\nRelated actions: Raise water level to prevent wild fires; Build fire breaks; Increase ‘on the ground’ protection for marshes or swamps, including fire fighting teams.\nKotze D.C.
