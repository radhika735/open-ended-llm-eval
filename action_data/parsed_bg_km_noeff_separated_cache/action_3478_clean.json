  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBrownfield sites include land that was once used for industrial or other human activity but is then left disused or partially used, for example disused quarries or mines, demolished or derelict factory sites, derelict farm buildings, derelict railways or contaminated land. Natural recolonization of these sites can result in valuable habitats for wildlife and provide migration corridors in built-up or disturbed areas."
