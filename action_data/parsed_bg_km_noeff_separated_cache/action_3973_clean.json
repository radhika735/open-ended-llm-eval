  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of maintaining upland heath/moorland on butterflies and moths. All three studies were in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that lightly grazed or ungrazed upland acid grassland had a higher species richness of moths than commercially grazed grassland.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Three controlled studies (including two replicated, randomized studies) in the UK found that ungrazed, lightly grazed or summer grazed upland grassland had a higher abundance of adult moths, moth caterpillars and all caterpillars than grassland grazed at commercial stocking densities or all year round.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIncreased management of upland heath, or moorland, in particular by overgrazing, has led to a reduction in characteristic vegetation cover in favour of more dominant grass species, which are less favoured by sheep (Martin et al. 2013). A reduction in grazing pressure, or a switch to low intensity cutting or burning regimes, may allow moorland vegetation to recover, and in turn potentially support larger populations of heathland butterflies and moths.\nSee also “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore or create heathland/shrubland”.\nMartin D., Fraser M.D., Pakeman R.J. & Moffat A.M.
