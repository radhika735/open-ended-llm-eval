  "action_title": "Primates: Use of automated feeders",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of using an automated feeder for primates.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAnticipating the arrival of food can lead to stress behaviours in captive animals. Automated feeders work by dispensing fresh food in pre-measured quantities, at timed intervals throughout the day with the aim of increasing time spent searching for, extracting and consuming food."
