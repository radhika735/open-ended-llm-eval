  "action_title": "Can captive breeding have deleterious effects on individual fitness?",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies of wild populations, wild and captive populations and museum specimens, one replicated, found evidence forÂ  potentially deleterious physiological or genetic changes due to captive breeding. These studies did not investigate fitness.\nA study of a wild Mauritius kestrel, Falco punctatus, population derived totally from captive individuals found high inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity, but this was caused more by the very low population size (four wild birds) than by captivity per se.\nThe museum-based study found reduced relative brain volume in captive wildfowl, compared with wild birds, whilst a comparison of wild and captive populations of white-headed ducks Oxyura leucocephala found lower genetic diversity in captive populations.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne potential problem with captive breeding is that it limits the effective population of a species to the number of captive individuals that are available to interbreed. This could lead to inbreeding depression and a loss of fitness. Similarly, the different selection pressures on individuals in captivity may alter the physiology of captive populations, as has occurred in domesticated species.\nIt is important to note that low genetic diversity, inbreeding and changes due to captivity do not necessarily lead to reduced fitness. Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the results from the studies below."
