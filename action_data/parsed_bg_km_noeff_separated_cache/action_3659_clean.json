  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of putting out wildfires on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn some environments, fires can damage important habitats, particularly if habitat patches are small or fragmented, meaning that entire patches can be destroyed in fires. The impacts of large-scale wildfires may result in significant changes to species diversity and community composition in those areas that are affected (Rochester et al. 2010), though the effects of fires and differing fire histories on reptile species, species richness and community composition can be variable and difficult to predict (Lindenmayer et al. 2008 and references therein).\nTesting this intervention may present a number of challenges, not least the potential need to allow some wildfires to burn that would have otherwise been put out. Practitioners should therefore carefully consider the harms that could be caused to people’s health and livelihoods by allowing wildfires to burn, as well as the harms to other species and habitats.\nSee also: Create fire breaks\nLindenmayer D.B., Wood J.T., MacGregor C., Michael D.R., Cunningham R.B., Crane M., Montague‐Drake R., Brown D., Muntz R. & Driscoll D.A.
