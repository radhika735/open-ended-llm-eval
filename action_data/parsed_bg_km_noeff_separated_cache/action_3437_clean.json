  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating crevice habitats on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures.\n\nThis means we did not find any studies that directly evaluated this intervention during our literature searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Crevice habitats’ are depressions with a length to width ratio &gt;3:1 and depth &gt;50 mm (modified “Crevices” from Strain et al. 2018).\nCrevice habitats provide organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Williams & Morritt 1995). They also provide shelter from predation or grazing (Menge & Lubchenco 1981) and some species preferentially settle into them (Chabot & Bourget 1988). The size and density of crevices is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small crevices can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth et al. 2020). Large crevices can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, crevices contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).\nCrevices sometimes form on artificial structures through erosion. However, these are often filled or repaired during maintenance works (Moreira et al. 2007) and are absent from many structures (Aguilera et al. 2014). Crevice habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.\nSee also: Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures; Create pit habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Create groove habitats (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Create ‘rock pools’ on intertidal artificial structures; Create small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (≤100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Create groove habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1–50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures.\nAguilera M.A., Broitman B.R. & Thiel M.
