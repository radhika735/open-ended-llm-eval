  "action_title": "Primates: Formulate diet to reflect nutritional composition of wild foods (including removal of domestic fruits)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that replacing milk with fruit juice in gorilla diets led to a decrease in regurgitation and reingestion. \nOne replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that when lemurs were fed a fruit-free diet aggression and self-directed behaviour were lower.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany primates are classed as fruit eaters, and so are provided with a diet with a high proportion of domestic fruits in captivity. Studies have shown this can lead to obesity, diabetes and dental disease (Plowman et al 2014). Domestic fruits have now been replaced with vegetable diets in many zoos, with subsequent reductions in obesity and dental conditions (Plowman et al 2014). The aim of this intervention is to reduce abnormal feeding behaviours, social tension and aggression within primates.\nPlowman, A.
