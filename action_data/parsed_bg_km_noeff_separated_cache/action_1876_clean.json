  "action_title": "Amphibians: Provide particular enclosure furniture for calling sites, breeding areas or egg laying sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes, as well as a variety of substrates to an enclosure, promoted egg laying in frogs.\nOne before-and-after study in Austria found that captive frogs started breeding when animals were housed in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites, as well as simulated wet and dry seasons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpecific habitat features may be critical to amphibian breeding by offering sites for calling, courtship or egg laying. Mimicking an amphibian’s natural environment in captivity by providing these habitat features or artificial alternatives could improve breeding success."
