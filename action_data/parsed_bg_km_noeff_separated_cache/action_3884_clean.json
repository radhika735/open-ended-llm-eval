  "action_title": "Remove or control non-native predators",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing or controlling non-native predators.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native predators, introduced outside of their natural range, can cause problems for native prey species, such as butterflies and moths, which are not adapted to cope with the additional predation pressure. The ideal conservation outcome is often to entirely remove non-native species, but this may not be possible if the species has become too widespread or abundant, or is difficult to catch and kill. However, where removal is not possible, on-going control of the non-native species may allow native butterflies and moths to persist alongside them."
