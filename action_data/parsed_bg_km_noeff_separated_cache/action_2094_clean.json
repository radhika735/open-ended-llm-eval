  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting limits on hull depth on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVessels can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through disturbance to the seabed and water flow(Hammerstrom et al. 2007). Setting limits on hull depth of vessels (recreational or commercial) entering an area may potentially reduce disturbance to subtidal benthic invertebrates as the hull would be further from the seabed and less likely to result in direct physical damage from collision, grounding, or in changes in water flow or sediment transport (Whitfield et al. 2002).\n \nHammerstrom K.K., Kenworthy W.J., Whitfield P.E. & Merello M.F. (2007) Response and recovery dynamics of seagrasses Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme and macroalgae in experimental motor vessel disturbances. Marine Ecology Progress Series 345, 83–92.\nWhitfield P., Kenworthy W., Hammerstrom K. & Fonseca M.
