  "action_id": "2867",
  "action_title": "Set or improve minimum sewage treatment standards",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting or improving minimum sewage treatment standards on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUntreated sewage reaching aquatic environments may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria, viruses and parasites, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Setting minimum sewage treatment standards, or improving the standards already in place, could potentially ensure that pollution levels and associated risks to marine and freshwater mammals are minimized. This may involve carrying out secondary or tertiary treatment of wastewater to further reduce pollutant levels."
