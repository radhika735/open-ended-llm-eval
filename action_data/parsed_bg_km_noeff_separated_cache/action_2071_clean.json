The study was in the English Channel (UK).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall species richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in the English Channel found that a site where aggregate extraction was undertaken using a moving trailer suction hopper dredger had similar invertebrate species richness and lower diversity compared to a site where extraction occurred using a static suction hopper dredger.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the English Channel found that a site where aggregate extraction was undertaken using a moving trailer suction hopper dredger had higher abundance of invertebrates compared to a site where extraction occurred using a static suction hopper dredger.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes. Aggregate extraction can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical removal, loss and alteration of seabed and habitat, and direct physical damage from the machinery used (De Groot 1996). Two methods are commonly practised: anchor suction hopper dredging, a static type of extraction (De Groot 1996), and trailer suction hopper dredging which takes place from a moving vessel (Birchenough et al. 2010; Boyd & Rees 2003). In some areas, such as in the UK, both methods are used (Boyd & Rees 2003). Although both methods cause severe disturbance in seabed invertebrate communities (Desprez 2000, Sardá et al. 2000), the differences between dredged and surrounding undredged areas are more significant after static dredging (Boyd & Rees 2003). Trailer dredging is thought to reduce the intensity, and therefore the impact, of dredging in any one area by leaving small pockets of areas unaffected and from which recolonization and recovery may occur (Szymelfenig et al. 2006). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Mining and quarrying”.\n \nBirchenough S.N., Boyd S.E., Vanstaen K., Coggan R.A. & Limpenny D.S.
