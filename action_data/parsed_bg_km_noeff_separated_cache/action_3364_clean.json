  "action_title": "Soak seeds of non-woody plants before sowing: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of brackish/saline wetlands – of soaking their seeds before sowing.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoaking seeds in water before sowing could increase germination speed and percentages, although the effect may vary between species (Marty & Kettenring 2017). This action involves soaking in water at near-ambient temperatures; other actions consider soaking in chilled or heated water. \nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak vegetation before planting; Chill seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.\nMarty J.E. & Kettenring K.M. (2017) Seed dormancy break and germination for restoration of three globally important wetland bulrushes. Ecological Restoration, 35, 138–147."
