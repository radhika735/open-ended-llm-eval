  "action_title": "Regularly remove traps and snares around agricultural fields",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of regularly removing traps and snares around agricultural fields on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves the regular removal of snares and traps frequently found around agricultural areas. For example, a nationwide chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus survey in Liberia found that signs of hunting with snares were associated with non-forested agricultural land, whereas signs of hunting with guns overlapped substantially with unmodified, forested areas (Tweh et al. 2014).\n            The removal of traps and snares from areas other than agricultural lands is discussed under ‘Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares’.\n \nTweh C., Lormie M., Kouakou C., Hillers A., Kuehl H. & Junker J. (2014) Conservation status of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and other large mammals across Liberia: results from a nationwide survey. Oryx, 1–9."
