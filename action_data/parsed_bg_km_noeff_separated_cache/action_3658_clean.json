This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that in areas with fire suppression measures combined with fences to exclude predators, reptile abundance increased over time.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn some environments, fires can damage important habitats, particularly if habitat patches are small or fragmented, meaning that entire patches can be destroyed in fires. Fire breaks are ploughed, open or unplanted gaps of land around the perimeters of, or spaced within, areas of forest, grassland or farmland intended to prevent the spread of fire, thereby protecting important habitats.Â  While the primary purpose of creating firebreaks may be top prevent the spread of fire, the open areas created could act as suitable habitat for some species, or present barriers to the movement of others.\nSee also: Put out wildfires."
