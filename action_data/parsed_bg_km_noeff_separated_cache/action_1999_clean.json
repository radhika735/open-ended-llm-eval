  "action_id": "1999",
  "action_title": "Control invasive non-predatory competitors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of controlling invasive non-predatory competitors of bats on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-predatory invasive species may compete with bats for resources. For example, the invasive rose-ringed parakeet Psittacula krameria has been reported to compete with and attack Leisler’s bats Nyctalus Leisleri roosting in tree cavities (Hernández-Brito et al. 2018).\nHernández-Brito D., Carrete M., Ibáñez C., Juste J. & Tella J.L. (2018) Nest-site competition and killing by invasive parakeets cause the decline of a threatened bat population. Royal Society Open Science, 5, 172477."
