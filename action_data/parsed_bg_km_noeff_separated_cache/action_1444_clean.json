  "action_title": "Chase crop raiding primates using dogs",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of using dogs to chase crop raiding primates away on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs guarding is extremely time-consuming to the farmer, in some regions, farmers may employ dogs to frighten and chase crop raiders from their farm. However, some species, like chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, may not feel threatened by dogs, or may lose their fear of dogs over time (McLennon & Hill 2012).\n            The use of langurs (Colobinae) to deter rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta is discussed under ‘Train langurs to deter rhesus macaques’.\n \nLonsdorf E.V., Ross S.R., Matsuzawa T.
