  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing emergency pollution plans on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSudden acute pollution events, such as oil spills, can cause serious disturbances and harm to marine and freshwater mammals (Helm et al. 2014). Pollution emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, should a pollution event occur. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of the response to minimize harmful impacts (Li et al. 2016).\nHelm R.C., Costa D.P., DeBruyn T.D., O'Shea T.J., Wells R.S. & Williams T.M. (2014) Overview of effects of oil spills on marine mammals. Pages 455–475 in: Fingas M. (ed.) Handbook of Oil Spill Science and Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nLi P., Cai Q., Lin W., Chen B. & Zhang B. (2016) Offshore oil spill response practices and emerging challenges. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 110, 6–27."
