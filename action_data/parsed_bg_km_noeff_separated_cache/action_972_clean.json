  "action_title": "Close off potential access points on turbines to prevent roosting bats",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of closing off potential access points on turbines to prevent roosting bats on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats have been observed roosting in the nacelles of wind turbines (Ahlén et al. 2009), as well as in turbine door slats, stairwells and between the gills of the transformer (Bennett et al. 2017). Closing off potential access points on wind turbines to prevent bats from roosting may reduce the risk of bat collisions with turbine blades.\nAhlén I., Baagøe H.J. & Bach L. (2009) Behavior of Scandinavian bats during migration and foraging at sea. Journal of Mammalogy, 90, 1318–1323.\nBennett V.J., Hale A.M. & Williams D.A. (2017) When the excrement hits the fan: fecal surveys reveal species-specific bat activity at wind turbines. Mammalian Biology, 87, 125–129."
