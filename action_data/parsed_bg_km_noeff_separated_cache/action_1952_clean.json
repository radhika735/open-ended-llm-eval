  "action_title": "Prevent culling of bats around fruit orchards",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of preventing culling of bats around fruit orchards on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats are frequently shot, persecuted, and even legally culled around fruit orchards to prevent damage to or loss of fruit crops. This is likely to have a significant impact on the survival of fruit bat populations. For example, the Mauritius fruit bat Pteropus niger has undergone an estimated population decline of 50% since government-implemented culling took place in 2015 and 2016 (Vincenot et al. 2017).\nVincenot C.E., Florens F.B.V. & Kingston T. (2017) Can we protect island flying foxes? Science, 355, 1368–1370."
