  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of fitting mesh escape panels to a trawl net and using a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend on marine fish populations. The study was in the English Channel (UK). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the English Channel found that using a trawl net with square mesh escape panels and a square mesh codend reduced the numbers of discarded finfish compared to a diamond mesh codend with no panels.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMesh escape panels (or windows) in commercial trawl nets are sections of net inserted in the codend or extension piece of a different mesh size and/or orientation (i.e. square) to the rest of the codend. They were developed to provide an area of escape for some fish while retaining target species such as prawns/shrimps that are expected to pass underneath. Square mesh codends provide another area for selection in a trawl net and may allow the escape of smaller fish. Square meshes, as opposed to conventional diamond meshes, are more likely to stay open under tension during trawling and thus create a larger gap through which fish can more easily pass. Thus, the combination of a mesh panel and square mesh codend should allow a larger number and range of individuals to escape from a trawl net than a conventional diamond mesh codend, or one or other of the escape panel or square mesh codend alone. However, likelihood of escape may depend on the species being targeted and the fish assemblages in the area being fished.\nThe effects of using just mesh panels or just a square mesh codend are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit mesh panels/windows to a trawl net’ and ‘Use a square mesh instead of a diamond mesh codend in a trawl net’, respectively. Similar interventions of various combinations of unwanted catch reduction devices, including mesh panels and square mesh codends are summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification’."
