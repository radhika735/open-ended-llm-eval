  "action_title": "Physically remove problematic plants: brackish/saline swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically removing problematic plants from brackish/saline swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action considers complete physical removal of problematic plants, i.e. pulling up or digging up entire plants, or scraping living vegetation from the swamp surface. Removal may be targeted to individual organisms, or applied to the whole plant community. The most appropriate removal method will depend on the species to be removed, and the site conditions (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016).\nIf plants are completely removed, including roots where applicable, immediate regrowth will be prevented (although long-term recolonization from the seed bank or from neighbouring sites is possible). For some species, disposing of the problem plants off-site may help to prevent regrowth, but disposal should be done carefully to avoid causing an invasion elsewhere (Stevens et al. 1997).\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Remove surface soil/sediment, including any plants on it.\nStevens K.J., Peterson R.L. & Stephenson G.R.
