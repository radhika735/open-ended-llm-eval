  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation by camouflaging nests on reptile populations. One study was in the USA and one was in Costa Rica.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that Ouachita map turtle nests that were disguised by sweeping with a broom were predated at a similar rate as unswept nests. One before-and-after, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that camouflaged (details of method not provided) olive ridley turtle nests had similar hatching and emergence success compared to nests moved to a hatchery.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCamouflaging nests, for example by sweeping the surface substrate to remove evidence of nest laying, removes visual cues that predators and humans may use to locate nests and so may reduce incidences of predation or poaching."
