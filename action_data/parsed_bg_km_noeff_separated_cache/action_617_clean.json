  "action_title": "Use puppets to increase the survival or growth of hand-reared chicks",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nThree replicated studies from the USA and Saudi Arabia found that corvids and bustards raised using puppets did not have higher survival, dispersal or growth than conventionally hand-reared chicks.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nA potential problem with hand-rearing chicks is that they will ‘imprint’ on the humans raising them and be unable to adjust to life in the wild or breed with conspecifics. It has therefore been suggested that chicks should be fed with as little human contact as possible and that puppets, designed to look like parent birds, be used to feed them."
