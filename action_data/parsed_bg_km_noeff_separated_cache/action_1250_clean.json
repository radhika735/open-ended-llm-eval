  "action_title": "Add organic matter",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled study in Brazil found that leaf litter addition increased species richness of young trees. One replicated, controlled study in Costa Rica found leaf litter addition decreased young tree density in artificial forest gaps. Both studies found no effect of litter addition on the density of tree regenerations under intact forest canopy.\nOne replicated, controlled study in Portugal found that adding plant material to the soil surface increased total plant cover. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found mixed effects on cover depending on understory plant group.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding organic matter (plant remains) to the ground increases soil nutrient content and soil moisture. It can also stimulate microbial populations that can stabilize soil structure. That may increase soil fertility and increase biodiversity in degraded forest areas."
