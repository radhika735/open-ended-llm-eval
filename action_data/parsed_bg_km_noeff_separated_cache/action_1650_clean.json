  "action_title": "Add mulch to control grass and sow seed",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne randomized, controlled study in the USAÂ found that adding mulch, followed by seeding with shrub seeds, increased the seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species but did not reduce grass cover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMulch is usually an organic material such as leaves, grass cuttings, or wood chips that is applied to the top layer of soils. Using mulch directly on unwanted plants can reduce the amount of light they receive and therefore may reduce their abundance. Combining this with the addition of seeds of shrubland plants may aid on the establishment of shrubland species."
