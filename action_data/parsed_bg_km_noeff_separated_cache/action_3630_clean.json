  "action_id": "3630",
  "action_title": "Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRetaining forest strips along water courses or around ponds during timber harvest can help mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest species. They can also help sustain the microclimate and reduce potential problems such as soil erosion. Retained habitat strips also provide corridors for dispersal.\nFor other studies on the effects of buffer strips see Threat: Agriculture – Create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields; Threat: Pollution – Plant riparian buffer strips; and Habitat protection – Retain buffer zones around core habitat."
