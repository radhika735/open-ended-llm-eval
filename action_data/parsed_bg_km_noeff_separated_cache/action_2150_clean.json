  "action_title": "Release live unwanted catch first before handling commercial species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of releasing live unwanted catch first before handling commercial species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling can lead to the capture large amounts of unwanted catch species. Animals caught in trawling nets can die from injuries sustained in the net, during handling, or when the catch is processed (Revill & Jennings 2005). Releasing live unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrates before handling/processing the commercially targeted species may increase their chances of survival following release back into the water, because they would have been out of the water for less time.\n \nRevill A.S. & Jennings S. (2005) The capacity of benthos release panels to reduce the impacts of beam trawls on benthic communities. Fisheries Research, 75, 73–85."
