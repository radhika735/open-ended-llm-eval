  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of translocating marine mammals to re-establish or boost native populations. The four studies were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One replicated study and one review in the North Pacific Ocean found that after translocating Hawaiian monk seals, along with rehabilitation or at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, more than a quarter of the seals reproduced.\nSurvival (4 studies): Two studies (including one replicated and one controlled study) in the North Pacific Ocean found that 50–83% of translocated, and 52% of rehabilitated and translocated, Hawaiian monk seal pups survived for at least one year. One of the studies and one review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocated seal pups had similar survival rates to non-translocated pups born at release sites or greater survival rates than non-translocated pups remaining at the original site. One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocating Hawaiian monk seals, along with at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, resulted in more than a quarter of the seals surviving.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that translocated Hawaiian monk seal pups had similar dispersal times to non-translocated seal pups born at release sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught marine and freshwater mammals into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events, and/or increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations may also be used to move mammals to areas where the chances of survival are likely to be higher, such as areas with reduced predation or better foraging conditions.\nFor other interventions related to translocations, see Translocate marine and freshwater mammal species before onset of impactful activities, Translocate mammals away from aquaculture systems to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Translocate or temporarily bring marine and freshwater mammals into captivity to reduce exposure to disease."
