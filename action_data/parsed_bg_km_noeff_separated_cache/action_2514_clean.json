  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty-five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing tunnels, culverts or underpass under roads. Eight studies were in the USA, four were in Australia, four were in Canada, two were in Spain, one each was in Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea and three were reviews with wide geographic coverage.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (3 studies): A study in South Korea found that road sections with higher underpass density did not have fewer wildlife-vehicle collisions. A review found that most studies recorded no evidence of predation of mammals using crossings under roads. A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that overwinter survival of mountain pygmy-possums increased after an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was installed.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (23 STUDIES)\n\nUse (23 studies): Seventeen of 20 studies (including seven replicated studies and two reviews), in the USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, and across multiple continents, found that crossing structures beneath roads were used by mammals whilst two studies found mixed results depending on species and one study found that culverts were rarely used as crossings by mammals. One of the studies found that crossing structures were used by two of four species more than expected compared to their movements through adjacent habitats. A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was used by mountain pygmy-possums. A replicated study in Germany found that use of tunnels by fallow deer was affected by tunnel colour and design. A study in the USA found that a range of mammals used culverts, including those with shelves fastened to the sides.\nBehaviour change (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that after an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was installed, dispersal of mountain pygmy-possums increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTunnels, culverts and underpasses may provide safe road crossing opportunities for mammals. A range of different tunnels can be used, including purpose-built wildlife tunnels, culverts that assist with drainage and which can also be used by wildlife, and large passages beneath elevated road section which may sometimes also be used for local vehicle access.\nUnderpasses are frequently installed in conjunction with wildlife barrier fencing which funnels animals towards the tunnel and prevents them from accessing the road. For this combined intervention, see Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads. See also Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways.\nStudies included here are those where barrier fencing is not installed or not explicitly referred to in the study methods or where at least some underpasses were in unfenced areas. Most studies here report solely on the use of these structures, such as the number of crossings made. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures."
