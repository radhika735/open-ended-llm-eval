  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding cover other than mulch to freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Australia.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in floodplain swamps in Australia found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs increased their overall cover, one year later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that covering plots with plastic or jute mats before planting native understory herbs reduced the cover of two problematic herb species, one year later.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanted vegetation may be damaged by hot, dry and bright conditions on bare wetland surfaces. Covers such as plastic mesh, sheets, or shelters for individual plants could ameliorate these factors and help planted vegetation to establish. The precise effect of covers may vary depending on the material used and how it is applied (e.g. to a large area vs individual plants; on the wetland surface vs suspended above the surface).\nRelated actions: Add cover other than mulch, other than to complement planting; Add surface mulch to complement planting; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas from physical damage, e.g. with tree guards or breakwaters."
