  "action_title": "Switch off artificial lighting at wild fisheries",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on freshwater mammals of switching off artificial lights at a wild fishery. The study was in the Puntledge River (Canada).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One randomized, controlled study in the Puntledge River found that switching off artificial lights on a bridge did not deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine and freshwater mammals, such as seals, may use artificial lighting to feed on fish at wild fisheries at night. Switching off lighting that shines onto the water may reduce mammal predation, thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict and the motivation to use lethal or harmful deterrents."
