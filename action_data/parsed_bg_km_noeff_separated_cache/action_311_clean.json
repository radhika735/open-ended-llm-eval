  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStudies have shown that visitors keep to paths when they are provided, thereby reducing disturbance to the wider habitat without the need for specific access restrictions (e.g. Pearce-Higgins & Yalden 1997).\nPearce-Higgins, J.W. & Yalden, D.W.
