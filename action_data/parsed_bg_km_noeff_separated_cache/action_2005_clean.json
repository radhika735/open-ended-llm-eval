  "action_title": "Carry out surveillance of bats to prevent the spread of disease/viruses to humans to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of carrying out surveillance of bats to prevent the spread of disease/viruses to humans to reduce human-wildlife conflict.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats can carry diseases and viruses that may spillover to human populations with serious risks to public health (e.g. see Schneeberger & Voigt 2016). Carrying out surveillance of bats for diseases and viruses, particularly in areas where bats and humans are in close contact, could provide an early warning system for potential spillover events and may allow preventative measures to be taken. This may reduce the persecution and culling of bats. Surveillance programmes and sampling protocols should aim to minimize disturbance to bats.\nSchneeberger K. & Voigt C.C.
