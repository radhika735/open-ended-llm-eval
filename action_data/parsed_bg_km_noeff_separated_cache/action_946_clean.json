  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of relocating access points to bat roosts within building developments on bat populations. One study was in Ireland and one in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)      \n\nUse (2 studies): One before-and-after study in Ireland found that fewer brown long-eared bats used a roost after the access points were relocated, and no bats were observed flying through them. One before-and-after study in the UK found that few lesser horseshoe bats used an alternative access point with a ‘bend’ design to re-enter a roost in a building development, but the number of bats using the roost increased after an access point with a ‘straight’ design was installed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves relocating the access points to a bat roost within a building development when the original access has been removed or altered. This could involve leaving gaps in brickwork, lead flashing or sofits, or the use of purpose-made ridge and roof tiles, bat bricks, tubes or chutes. For an intervention that involves retaining existing access points, see ‘Retain existing bat roosts and access points within developments’."
