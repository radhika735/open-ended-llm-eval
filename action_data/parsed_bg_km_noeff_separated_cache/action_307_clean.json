  "action_id": "307",
  "action_title": "Reduce bycatch by employing seasonal or area closures",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects on seabird populations or bycatch rates of seasonal or area closures.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBirds show seasonal patterns of habitat use and therefore reducing fishing in areas where there are large populations of foraging birds may reduce bycatch. However, these areas may also be the most profitable to fish in, as seabirds are likely to follow fish stocks. Closures may therefore not be a viable option."
