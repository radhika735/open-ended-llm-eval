  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One randomized, replicated experiment from Belgium found increased microbial biomass when crop remains and straw were added.\nCompaction: One study from India found improved soil structure when straw was incorporated. One before-and-after trial from the UK found that incorporating straw residues by discing (reduced tillage) did not improve anaerobic soils (low oxygen levels) in compacted soils.\nErosion: Two randomized, replicated studies from Canada and India measured the effect of incorporating straw on erosion. One found straw addition reduced soil loss, and one found mixed effects depending on soil type.\nNutrient loss: Four replicated studies from Belgium, the UK and the USA (one also controlled, one also randomized, and two also controlled and randomized) reported higher soil nitrogen levels when compost or straw was applied, but mixed results when processed wastes were added. One also found reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated. One replicated study from China and the Philippines found mixed results depending on site.\nSoil organic carbon: Six studies from China, Denmark and India measured the effect of incorporating plant material into the soil. All (including one replicated, two randomized, replicated studies, one controlled, randomized, replicated studies and one controlled before-and-after site comparison) found higher carbon levels when plant material was added. One found higher carbon levels when straw was applied along with NPK fertilizers. One also found larger soil aggregates. One replicated study from China and the Philippines found mixed results depending on site.\nYield: One replicated trial from Denmark found higher barley yield when straw was incorporated. One trial from the Philippines found higher grain yields when crop remains were incorporated earlier in the season.\n \nSoil types covered: clay, clay loam, fine loam, loam/sandy loam, loamy sand, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy-silt, silt loam, silty, silty-clay.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention refers to plant material and crop remains which have been brought in from elsewhere, rather than being left as ‘residues’ in the soil or on the soil surface after harvest of the valuable crop part (see also ‘Retain crop remains’). Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms in a given amount of soil and is measured by the amount of carbon or nitrogen they release into the soil. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Nitrogen immobilisation (or demineralisation) is the conversion of inorganic compounds (e.g. nitrogen) to organic compounds by micro-organisms (e.g. incorporating it into cells), making it unavailable to plants. In this intervention, immobilisation is being encouraged after cropping to reduce nitrogen leaching. Macroorganic matter is defined as the fraction of soil organic matter with particles larger than 150 μm, made up of fragmented plant residues and microbial debris. Although a small component of soils (macroorganic matter makes up 3-6% of total soil organic matter), it is often called the ‘active’ fraction as it is linked to water availability and nutrient supply for both plants and microorganisms."
