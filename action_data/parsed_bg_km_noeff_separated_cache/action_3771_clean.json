  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTen studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of releasing captive-bred snakes and lizards into the wild. Three studies were in New Zealand, two were in the USA and one was in each of the Galápagos, Spain, Australia and Canada and one was global.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One global review found that when using recruitment to the adult population as a measure of success, 32% of reptile releases (releases of captive individuals were 7% of total projects) were successful. One review in New Zealand found that 13% of lizard releases (some involving captive-bred animals) found evidence of populations growth\nReproductive success (3 studies): Three studies (including two reviews) in the USA and New Zealand found evidence of breeding following release in one of two captive-bred populations of cornsnakes, one captive-bred population of Otago skinks and in at least 16 lizard mitigation translocations, some of which involved captive-bred animals.\nSurvival (9 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that released large psammodromus lizards had similar annual survival compared to resident lizards. Two of six studies (including one replicated study and two reviews) in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada reported that 13% of 40 indigo snakes were re-sighted at least once during 5–8 years following release or that 58% of 12 Otago skinks survived at least 18 months. Two studies found that zero of nine and 27 individuals survived more than 143 days or beyond their first hibernation. The other two studies found that one of two and five of 53 releases (only some of which involved captive-bred animals) failed completely (no individuals survived). One study in New Zealand found that survival of captive-bred Otago skinks released into an enclosure was higher when mice had been eradicated compared to when skinks were released in the presence of mice. One replicated study in the Galápagos found that while releases were ongoing over a decade (183 released in total), 17–32 Galápagos land iguanas were recaptured each year.\nCondition (1 study): One controlled study in New Zealand found that body condition of captive-reared Otago skinks was higher than wild skinks, but sprint speed was lower.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that released large psammodromus lizards moved between habitat fragments more frequently than resident lizards but showed similar behaviour in three other measures.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding is normally used to provide individuals that can then be released into the wild (often called ‘reintroduction’) to either re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population (‘restocking’).\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release, or post-release feeding and care.\nThis action includes studies describing the effects of release programmes for captive-bred reptiles that do not specifically test the effectiveness of specific release techniques. For studies that compare specific release techniques see Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of captive-bred reptiles; Use holding pens or enclosures at release site prior to release of wild reptiles and Release reptiles into burrows.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Crocodilians or Tuatara."
