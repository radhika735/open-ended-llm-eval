  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting unwanted catch quotas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn fisheries terms, unwanted catch (sometimes referred to as “bycatch”, although the exact meaning of this term varies) are species whose captures were unintentional or unwanted. For instance, these can include undersize or over quota for species of commercial value, but also species that hold no commercial value. Here, we only consider unintentionally captured species of no commercial value. Some fishing practices can lead to considerable amounts of benthic invertebrate unwanted catch (Davies et al. 2009). Unwanted catch quotas are used to set catch limits for unwanted species. When the quota for a particular species is reached, the fishery may be closed to all forms of fishing likely to catch that species. This may potentially reduce fishing in an area, thereby reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.\n \nDavies R.W.D., Cripps S.J., Nickson A. & Porter G.
