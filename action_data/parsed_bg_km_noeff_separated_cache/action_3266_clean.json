  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing seeds or propagules of trees/shrubs to freshwater wetlands. One study was in Australia and one study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): One study in a floodplain swamp clearing in the USA simply reported the number of tree seedlings present within three years of sowing tree seeds. There were no seedlings of two of the five sown species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER           \n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated study in Australia reported 0–18% germination of tree/shrub seeds sown into a wet meadow, depending on the species and whether vegetation was cleared before sowing.\nSurvival (1 study): The same study reported 0% survival, after 8 months, of seedlings that had germinated from sown tree/shrub seeds.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves introducing seeds or propagules of emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. “Propagules” is the term used to describe the seed-like, usually leafless structures produced by mangrove trees to allow them to reproduce and disperse. Seeds or propagules may be collected from plants in greenhouses/laboratories, or from natural sites. They may be sown directly into the soil, scattered over the surface, or carried to suitable sites by water (e.g. after dropping them into the sea during an incoming tide).\nIntroduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. Seeds and propagules are easier to handle than plants, and can be a cost-effective way to introduce vegetation to large areas – but they can be more susceptible to herbivory or being washed away (e.g. Schoenholz et al. 2001).\nThe effects of sowing may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were seeds/propagules introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the conditions over the duration of the study?\nThe scope of this action does not include sowing nurse plants; sowing submerged or floating plants; sowing to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); or sowing facultative wetland plants in upland sites. In contrast, the scope does include sowing non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).\nRelated actions: Directly plant whole plants; Introduce vegetation fragments; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including planting.\nBrown S.C. & Bedford B.L.
