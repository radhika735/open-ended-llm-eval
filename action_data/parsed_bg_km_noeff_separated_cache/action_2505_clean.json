  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of using predator scent to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. All three studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (3 studies): Two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (including two before-and-after studies), in the USA, found that coyote scent reduced food consumption by mountain beavers and white-tailed deer. The third study found that it did not reduce trail use by white-tailed deer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWild herbivores may be sensitive to scents from predators and may alter their behaviour or visitation rates to a site accordingly (Wikenros et al. 2015). If scents can be deployed artificially, they could reduce crop damage caused by wild herbivores and, hence, reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of these animals.\n \nWikenros C., Kuijper D.P.J., Behnke R. & Schmidt K.
