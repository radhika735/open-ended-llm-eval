  "action_title": "Use shelterwood harvest instead of clearcutting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree replicated, controlled studies in SwedenÂ and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity,  lower grass cover and higher  density of tree species compared with clearcutting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nShelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged trees without clearcutting. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuts, with trees removed uniformly over the plot. This allows new seedlings to grow from seeds dispersed by older trees. This can help in maintaining distinctive forest species and increase structural diversity of stands."
