  "action_id": "2900",
  "action_title": "Reduce hammer energy during pile driving",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing hammer energy during pile driving on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPile driving is the process of driving large supports or foundations (‘piles’) into the sea floor or river bed with an impact hammer during the construction of wind turbines, offshore oil and gas structures, bridges and wharfs etc. The high intensity sounds produced by pile driving may disturb and cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Bailey et al. 2010). Reducing the hammer energy used during pile driving may reduce noise exposure and the risk of injury.\nBailey H., Senior B., Simmons D., Rusin J., Picken G. & Thompson P.M. (2010) Assessing underwater noise levels during pile-driving at an offshore windfarm and its potential effects on marine mammals. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 60, 888–897."
