  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on the use of suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal to control parrot’s feather.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSuction dredging consists of the use of high pressure water pumps to remove submerged vegetation. This method removes the plants with their root system and therefore reduces their capacity to regrow. The use of scuba divers allows for high species specificity and a combination of suction dredging and hand weeding has successfully eradicated small populations of other invasive aquatic plants (Hussner et al. 2017), including species of the same genus as parrot’s feather (e.g. Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum; Boylen et al. 1996). The control of parrot’s feather using water jet ventilation is presented in ‘Removal using water jets’ and the use of manual and mechanical harvesting to control parrot’s feather are respectively discussed in ‘Manual harvesting (hand-weeding)’ and ‘Mechanical harvesting or cutting’. Control via mechanical excavation is discussed under ‘Mechanical excavation’.\nBoylen C.W., Eichler L.W., & Sutherland J.W. (1996).
