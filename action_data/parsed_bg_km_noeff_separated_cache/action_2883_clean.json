  "action_title": "Establish aquaculture to extract the nutrients from run-offs",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing aquaculture to extract the nutrients from run-offs on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Agricultural waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Excess nutrients from agricultural waste can lead to diminished water quality and eutrophication events, including harmful algal blooms. Some species used in aquaculture can naturally improve water quality through feeding (e.g. filter feeding species, such as mussels) or through photosynthesis (e.g. algae species). Establishing certain types of aquaculture near polluted areas may be an effective method for the removal of excess nutrients (Duarte & Krause-Jensen 2018).\nDuarte C.M. & Krause-Jensen D. (2018) Intervention options to accelerate ecosystem recovery from coastal eutrophication. Frontiers in Marine Science, 5."
