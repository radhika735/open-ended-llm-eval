  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies (including four replicated and/or controlled studies) in the USA compared amphibians in thinned to unharvested forest. Two found mixed effects of thinning on abundance, depending on amphibian species and time since harvest. One found that amphibian abundance increased, except for ensatina salamanders. One found a negative overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians and one found that thinning did not affect abundance. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North AmericaÂ found that partial harvest, which included thinning with three other types, decreased salamander populations. One controlled, before-and-after site comparison study in the USA found that high volumes of pre-existing downed wood prevented declines in amphibian populations following thinning.\nFour studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA compared amphibians in thinned to clearcut forest. Two found higher amphibian abundance, apart from ensatina salamanders, or a less negative overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians in thinned forest. Two found mixed effects on abundance depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included thinning with three other types, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting.\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used thinned forest a similar amount, or for one species more than unharvested forest and that emigrating salamanders, but not frogs, used it significantly more than clearcuts.\nOne site comparison study in the USA found that thinning decreased the body condition of ensatina salamanders 10 years after harvest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning of trees, that is removal of trees to reduce density (by up to 50%), is undertaken in commercial forestry such as in plantations to ensure that stands are made up of healthy, evenly spaced trees. However, it can also be used as a conservation management practice to restore more natural open woodland. It can also increase structural diversity of young even-aged stands and promote development of late-successional characteristics such as larger trees, multi-level canopies and understory vegetation. Such features are often lost due to active fire suppression or loss of populations of large mammal grazers and browsers."
