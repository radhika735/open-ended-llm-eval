  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of using reward removal to prevent non-target species from entering traps. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USAÂ found that when reward removal was practiced, the rate of San Clemente Island fox entry into traps set for feral cats was reduced.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAnimals may be trapped for a variety of reasons. In some cases, such as where trapping is aimed at non-native species, a large number of traps might be set across the landscape. If there is a risk of catching non-target species, these will typically be live traps, from which individuals of non-target species can be released. However, trapping of animals usually entails at least some risk of injury to the animal as well as further risks, such as keeping parents away from their young. Furthermore, a trap holding a non-target animal is generally not then available for capturing the target animal until next visited by an operator. Reward removal may be attempted, whereby strong-smelling bait is left in a form or situation where it is unavailable to animals, to consume. The intention is that non-target species will learn not to pursue that smell."
