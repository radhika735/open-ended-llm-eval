  "action_title": "Water primrose: Biological control using fungal-based herbicides",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was found on the use of biological control of water primrose using fungal-based herbicides.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nApplication of a mass-produced, formulated product made of microorganisms can potentially be used as a means of controlling invasive plants (Gassmann et al. 2006).  For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that certain strains of a plant pathogenic fungus Glomerella cingulata may be effective against water primrose Ludwigia adscendens, St. John's wort Hypericum perforatum and other plant species such as Koster's Curse Clidemia hirta and Needlebush Hakea sericea (Jensen 1992).\nGassmann A., Cock M.J.W., Shaw R. & Evans H.C. (2006) The potential for biological control of invasive alien aquatic weeds in Europe: a review. Hydrobiologia, 570, 217-222.\nJensen K.I.N.
