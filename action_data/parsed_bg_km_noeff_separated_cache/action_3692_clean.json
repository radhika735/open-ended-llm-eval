  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using visual deterrents on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that a similar number of loggerhead turtle nests marked with red flags were predated compared to those marked only with wooden stakes.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
