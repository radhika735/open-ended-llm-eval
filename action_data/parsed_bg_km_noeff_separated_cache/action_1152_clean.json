  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies from Ethiopia and Nepal (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities. One replicated, site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommunity-managed forests are forests managed by local communities. They aim to provide a livelihood for local communities while, at the same time, conserving biodiversity. However, a clearly established definition of community-managed forests is missing, and the difference with state and privately managed forests is not always clear (Casse & Millhøj 2013).\nCasse T. & Milhøj A. (2013) While waiting for the answer: A critical review of meta-studies of tropical forest management. Journal of Environmental Management, 131, 334–342."
