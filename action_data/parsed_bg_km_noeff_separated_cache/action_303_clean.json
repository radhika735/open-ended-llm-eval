  "action_title": "Use high-visibility mesh on gillnets to reduce seabird bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA repeated, randomised and controlled trial in the USA found that having gillnets made partially from high-visibility mesh was effective in reducing seabird bycatch.\nHaving a greater percentage (25% vs. 10%) of the net made from high-visibility mesh was more effective, but also reduced catch of the target species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPursuit-diving birds (those most vulnerable to gillnets) are visual hunters, and so high-visibility mesh may reduce the number caught as bycatch. There is also the possibility, however, that highly-visible nets will reduce the number of target species caught."
