  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using non-offset hooks on reptile populations. One study was off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and one was in the north-east Atlantic.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled, paired study in the north-east Atlantic Ocean found that mortality of leatherback turtles was similar when caught with non-offset hooks or offset hooks.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nUnwanted catch (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired studies (including one controlled study) off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and in the north-east Atlantic found that non-offset circle hooks caught a similar number of olive ridley and green turtles compared to offset circle hooks in a shallow-set longline fishery. The other study found that non-offset G-style circle hooks caught fewer leatherback and hard-shell turtles compared to offset Gt-style circle hooks or offset J-hooks in a longline swordfish fishery.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe hook points on non-offset hooks lie along the same plane as the hook shaft, whereas the points on offset hooks are bent sideways and out of alignment with the hook shaft (usually within 25áµ’). As a result, offset hooks may be more likely to catch turtles in the mouth or on the body than non-off set hooks.\nStudies in this action specifically test whether non-offset hooks are more, or less likely to catch sea turtles than offset hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to different types of J-hooks, see: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.\nSee Use non-ringed hooks and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test the effect of using these variations in hook design.
