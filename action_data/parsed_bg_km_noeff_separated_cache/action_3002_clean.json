  "action_title": "Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest: brackish/salt marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of harvest in brackish/salt marshes (or harvesting at different intensities).\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHarvesting vegetation less intensely may increase its capacity to recover. Harvesting a smaller area or removing fewer plants leaves a larger population of plants to grow or spread into harvested gaps. Removing less of each plant might avoid killing them and allow them to regrow. Techniques such as selective harvesting, thinning rather than clear-cutting, and patch retention harvesting are all included within this action. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.\nNote that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any intensity, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing, including studies where cut vegetation is not removed."
