  "action_title": "Limit the number of fishing permits/licences to limit vessel or fisher numbers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of fishing licences or permits to limit vessel or fisher numbers on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRestrictions on the number of permits or licences issued to fish in an area or fishery is often termed ‘limited entry’. This prevents the entry of new fishing vessels and/or fishers operating without vessels (fishing from shore for example), with the aim of controlling fishing effort and capacity of a fleet, and in turn reduce the effects of overfishing on fish populations. However, the effectiveness of permits/licences may depend partly on other mechanisms to prevent increases in capacity by other means, such as increases in vessel horsepower or size, gear changes or improvements or changes in fishing periods or areas (Ward et al. 2004).\nWard J.M., Kirkley J.E., Metzner R. & Pascoe S.
