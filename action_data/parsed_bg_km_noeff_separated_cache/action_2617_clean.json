  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of providing food or salt licks to divert mammals from roads. One study was in the USA, one was in Norway and one was a review of studies from across North America and Europe.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that intercept feeding reduced mule deer road deaths along two of three highways in one of two years. A replicated, site comparison study in Norway found that intercept feeding reduced moose collisions with trains.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A review of feeding wild ungulates in North America, and Europe found that feeding diverted ungulates away from roads in one of three studies.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n‘Intercept feeding’ provides supplemental food sources in a particular location in an attempt to divert animals away from roads or railways. It is typically used as a technique aimed at ungulates, which can account for a large number of collisions between vehicles and wildlife (e.g. an estimated &gt;1 million deer-vehicle collisions annually in the USA, Conover et al. 1995).\nConover M.R., Pitt W.C., Kessler K.K., DuBow T.J. & Sanborn W.A.
