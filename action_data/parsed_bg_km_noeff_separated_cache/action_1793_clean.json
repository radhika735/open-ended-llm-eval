  "action_id": "1793",
  "action_title": "Plant shelter belts to protect peatlands from wind",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of planting shelter belts to protect peatlands from wind.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRows of trees can be planted as windbreaks, which could prevent excess drying and erosion of surface peat. Strong winds and storms may become more common with climate change. Some trees do not grow in wet peat but could be planted in natural or created mounds, or along the edges of other land uses such as roads or farms.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: retain/create pollution buffer zones; build fire breaks. These could both be dual functions of shelter belts."
