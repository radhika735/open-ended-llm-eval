  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Water level drawdown",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that water removal to expose plants to drying during the summer led to lower survival of parrot’s feather plants than exposing plants to drying during the winter.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention, although limited to waterbodies in which water levels can be regulated, has the potential to reduce or eliminate aquatic invasive plants (Hussner et al. 2017). Water level drawdown consists of reducing the water level of a waterbody to expose submerged plants to drying (or freezing) conditions (De Winton et al. 2013). Desiccation may then result in plant mortality. However, parrot’s feather plants can withstand some level of desiccation (Cook 2004) and therefore control using this technique is dependent on the duration of the water level drawdown. The reduction of water levels could also impact non-target native aquatic species.\n \nCook C.D.K (2004) Aquatic and wetland plants of Southern Africa.
