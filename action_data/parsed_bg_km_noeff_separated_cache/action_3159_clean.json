  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to freshwater swamps or their catchments. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nRelative abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of shrubby wetland vegetation in the USA found that liming had no significant effect on the relative abundance of plant taxa. For 49 of 49 taxa, differences or similarities in relative abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years after intervention.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of shrubby wetland vegetation in the USA found that for most plant taxa, differences or similarities in abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years following intervention. This was true for 31 of 31 herbaceous plant taxa, 16 of 16 woody plant taxa, and one of two moss taxa.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWetlands can become acidified through processes such as:\n\ndeposition of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the air. These originate from a range of man-made sources, e.g. transport exhausts and gas flaring on oil wells (Uyigue & Agho 2007).\nexposure of acid sulfate soils to oxygen, for example through drought, drainage or dredging. These soils are present in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (Dent 1986) and salinized inland areas (Baldwin 2011).\ninflows of acidic waste water from mining operations, for example in the Odiel Marshes, southwest Spain (Davila et al. 2019). This is formed when metal sulfide minerals, exposed during mining, react with oxygen.\n\nAcidity can be reduced with calcium and/or magnesium-rich substances, such as lime CaO or Ca(OH)2, limestone CaCO3, magnesium oxide MgO, fly ash (residue from burning coal) or biochar (a type of charcoal). Adding these chemicals can also affect nutrient availability, because nutrients such as phosphorous become locked away in acidic soils or sediments (Weil & Brady 2016).\nNeutralizing chemicals might be added directly to a focal site, added to an adjacent water body, or applied elsewhere in the watershed (which may reduce negative impacts on water quality associated with direct addition; Dorland et al. 2005).\nRelated actions: Clean waste water before it enters the environment, including diversion of acidified water into designated treatment wetlands; Add lime or similar chemicals to complement planting.\nBaldwin D.
