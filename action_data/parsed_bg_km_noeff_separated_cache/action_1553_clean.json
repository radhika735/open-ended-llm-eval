  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years, despite undergoing pre-release veterinary screens, alongside other interventions. One study in Brazil found that most reintroduced black lion tamarins that underwent veterinary screens, alongside other interventions, survived over four months.\nOne before-and-after study in Malaysia found that 90% of reintroduced Müller's Bornean gibbons did not survive despite undergoing veterinary screens, alongside other interventions. One controlled study in Indonesia found that reintroduced Bornean agile gibbons that underwent veterinary screens, alongside other interventions, behaved similarly to wild gibbons.\nTwo studies, including one controlled, in Malaysia and Indonesia found that most translocated orangutans that underwent veterinary screens, along with other interventions, survived translocation and the first three months post-translocation.\nFour studies, including three before-and-after studies, in Liberia, the Republilc of Congo and Guinea found that most reintroduced chimpanzees that underwent veterinary screens, alongside other interventions, survived over 1-5 years. One before and after study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements after undergoing pre-release veterinary screens, alongside other interventions.\nFive studies, including four before-and-after studies, in Belize, French Guiana, Madagascar, Congo and Gabon found that most reintroduced or translocated primates that underwent veterinary screens, alongside other interventions, survived at least four months or increased in population size.\nFive studies, including four before-and-after studies, in French Guiana, Madagascar, South Africa and Vietnam found that most reintroduced or translocated primates were assumed to have died post-release despite undergoing pre-release veterinary screens, alongside other interventions.\nOne controlled study in Kenya found that a population of translocated olive baboons were still surviving 16 years after translocation when veterinary screens were applied alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention aims to detect potentially dangerous diseases in primates that are being introduced/translocated to prevent disease transmission to resident, wild primates. The IUCN guidelines suggest that disease screening should test primates for infectious agents that are not found naturally in wild populations of the species/taxonomic group of concern (such as pathogens acquired from people or other animals) and agents that may result in the introduction or spread of potentially dangerous diseases. The infectious agents that are ultimately tested for depend on the geographical region, taxon of concern, available technologies, funding, and other such factors (Soorae & Baker 2002).\n \nSoorae P.S. & Baker L.R.
