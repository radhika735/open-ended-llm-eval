  "action_title": "Employ hunters in the conservation sector to reduce their impact",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of employing hunters in the conservation sector to reduce their impact on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIt is believed that one way to control the hunting of primates is to offer employment to hunters in the conservation sector, for instance as anti-poaching rangers, monitoring and data collection officers, or eco-tourist guides. Employment provides the hunter with a regular income source and the hunter will gain knowledge on the importance of conserving primates and potentially pass this knowledge on to other hunters/members in the community. Furthermore, employing hunters as conservation practitioners makes use of the excellent tracking skills and large knowledge base."
