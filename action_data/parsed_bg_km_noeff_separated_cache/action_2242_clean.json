  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of establishing community-based fisheries management on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in the Foveaux Straight (New Zealand).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nMollusc abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Foveaux Straight found that a customary fisheries area where management was community-based had more New Zealand scallops compared to a protected area prohibiting all fishing and an area allowing recreational harvest.\nMollusc condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Foveaux Straight found that a customary fisheries area where management was community-based, tended to have smaller New Zealand scallops compared to a protected area prohibiting all fishing and an area allowing recreational harvest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Community-based fisheries management, sometimes referred to as indigenous customary management (Twist et al. 2016), assigns the management of marine resources to the local community who often possesses traditional and local knowledge crucial to local management. Community-based fisheries management is often based on a partial protection strategy, which uses one or more spatial management measures (for instance measures that restrict some aspect of the fishery; Cinner & Aswani 2007). Community-based management gives local communities the power to set regional fisheries bylaws and/or regulations and has been implemented into legislation in several countries (Ruddle 1998). By regulating and limiting fishing effort, and protecting the marine environment, community-based fisheries management can, in theory, reduce the impacts on the seabed, the amount of bycatch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Twist et al. 2016).\nEvidence for related intervention is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Establish territorial user rights for fisheries”.\n \nCinner J.E. & Aswani S.
