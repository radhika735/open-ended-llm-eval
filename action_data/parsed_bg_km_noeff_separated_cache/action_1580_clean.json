  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCorridors are areas of natural habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones) and enable particular plant and animal species to disperse and migrate, processes which are necessary for their survival (Rouget et al. 2006). For example, a simulation study by Bruford et al. (2010) examined the genetic implications of management options for the highly fragmented orangutan population in the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Malaysia and demonstrated that a combination of modest translocation rates (one individual every 20 years) and corridor establishment enabled even the most isolated subpopulations to retain demographic stability and constrain localised inbreeding to small levels. Simiarily, a study in Kenya (Anderson et al. 2007) found that perennial plantations of cashew nut, mango or coconut as well as timber plantations and remnants of indigenous shrubland vegetation were frequently used by Angolan black-and-white colobus Colobus angolensis palliatus to move between fragments of their main coastal forest habitats.\n \nAnderson, J., Rowcliffe, J.M. and Cowlishaw, G.
