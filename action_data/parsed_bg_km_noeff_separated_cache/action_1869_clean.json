  "action_title": "Amphibians: Allow amphibians from highly seasonal environments to have a period of dormancy during a simulated drought period",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of allowing amphibians from highly seasonal environments to have a period of dormancy during a simulated drought period.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDormancy (or aestivation) is a natural process for some amphibians from warmer regions, where they move underground and dramatically slow down their metabolic processes in order to save energy in hot, dry weather. Breeding is also seasonal and can be triggered by longer periods of sunlight, changing temperatures or increased/decreased rainfall. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure."
