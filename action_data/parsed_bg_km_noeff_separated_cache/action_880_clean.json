  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFifteen studies investigated the effectiveness of creating wetlands for amphibians.\nFive site comparison studies (including four replicated studies) in the USA compared created to natural wetlands and found that created wetlands had similar numbers of amphibian species, amphibian abundance or communities depending on depth as natural wetlands. Two of the studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands. One site comparison study in the USA found that created wetlands had similar numbers of species to adjacent forest. One global review and two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the USA combined created and restored wetlands and compared them to natural wetlands and found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands. Three site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that certain amphibian species were only found in created or natural wetlands. \nOne before-and-after study in Australia found that captive-bred green and golden bell frog tadpoles released into a created wetland did not establish a self-sustaining population.\nFive studies (including two replicated studies) in Kenya and the USA that investigated colonization of created wetlands found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized the wetlands. One global review and three studies (including two replicated studies) in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and amphibian abundance in created wetlands were affected by wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence and distance to source wetlands.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLoss and degradation of wetlands are two major factors contributing to the global decline of amphibians. Many wetlands have been drained and altered to allow for agriculture and urban development. It has been estimated that the number of wetlands had declined by 33–90% depending on the region of the world (Mitsch & Gosselink 2007).\nCreation of wetlands may help to replace some of the habitat lost and therefore help to maintain and increase amphibian populations. However, wetland dynamics are complex and the success of created wetlands depends on many factors such as vegetation, geomorphology and hydrology.\nThere is additional literature describing the presence of amphibians in agricultural and mine-drainage treatment wetlands designed to intercept and process pollutants (Lacki et al. 1992; Smiley et al. 2011). Use by wildlife is not typically considered in the design of treatment wetlands and wildlife may be restricted using exclusion barriers, trapping or other habitat modifications. Therefore, these studies are not included here.\nStudy ‘ponds’ and ‘pools’ have been referred to as ‘ponds’ within this section. Studies investigating the creation of individual ponds are discussed in: 'Create ponds for amphibians', 'Create ponds for frogs', 'Create ponds for toads', 'Create ponds for natterjack toads', 'Create ponds for green toads', 'Create ponds for salamanders (including newts)' and 'Create ponds for great crested newts'.\nLacki M.J., Hummer J.W. & Webster H.J.
