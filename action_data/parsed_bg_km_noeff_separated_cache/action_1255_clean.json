  "action_title": "Use prescribed fire after tree planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo of four studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Finland, France and the USA found that using prescribed fire after replanting increased the survival and  sprouting rate of planted trees.  One study found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect of prescribed fire on the size and survival rate of planted trees.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed fires are used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional ‘wildfires’ that have been suppressed through management. Using prescribed fires in such habitats can improve the establishment of the planted tree seedlings."
