  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of controlling ectoparasites in wild reptile populations. This study was in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One controlled study in New Zealand found that McCann’s skinks treated for mites had more successful pregnancies and produced more viable offspring than untreated skinks.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAlthough the effects of parasites, such as ticks and mites, on their hosts are often undetectable, there can be serious adverse health effects of high parasite burdens, including reduced reproductive output and increased mortality (Wall 2007). Treatments, developed primarily for domestic animals, may be administered to wild reptiles to reduce parasite burdens. The administering of such treatments, though, can be challenging.\nWall R. (2007) Ectoparasites: future challenges in a changing world. Veterinary Parasitology, 148, 62–74."
