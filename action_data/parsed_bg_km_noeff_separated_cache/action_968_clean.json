  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of deterring bats from wind turbines using ultrasound on bat populations. The four studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (one with a before-and-after trial in the second year) in the USA found mixed results. In the first year of one study, 21-51% fewer bats were killed at turbines with an ultrasonic deterrent fitted than at control turbines, but in the second year, from 2% more to 64% fewer bats were killed at turbines with ultrasonic deterrents fitted. One study found that using an ultrasonic deterrent emitting a constant or pulsed signal had mixed effects on the fatality rates of three bat species. One study found that using ultrasonic deterrents resulted in fewer fatalities for two of three bat species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One paired sites study in the USA found fewer bats flying near one of two wind turbines with an ultrasonic deterrent compared to turbines without, but the effect of the deterrent overall was not significant.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats rely on ultrasound to echolocate for foraging and navigation. Broadcasting ultrasonic sounds at the frequency range which bats use for echolocation may act as a deterrent by interfering with their ability to perceive echoes. Three studies in the USA found reduced bat activity at pond sites when ultrasonic deterrents were used (Szewczak & Arnett 2006, Szewczak & Arnett 2008, Johnson et al. 2012).
