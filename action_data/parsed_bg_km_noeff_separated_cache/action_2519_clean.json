  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing tunnels, culverts or underpass under railways. Two studies were in Spain, one was in each of Australia, Canada and the Netherlands and one reviewed literature from a range of countries.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A review found that most studies recorded no evidence of predation in or around passages under railways or roads of mammals using those passages.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\n\nUse (5 studies): Five studies, in Spain, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands, found that tunnels, culverts and underpasses beneath railways were used by a range of mammals including rodents, rabbits and hares, carnivores, marsupials, deer and bears. One of these studies found that existing culverts were used more than were specifically designed wildlife tunnels.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTunnels, culverts and underpasses may provide safe railway crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different tunnels can be used, often in combination with wildlife barrier fencing which funnels animals towards the tunnel and prevents them from accessing the railway (see Install barrier fencing along railways). Studies summarised within this intervention cover both tunnels created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes (e.g. drainage or farm access) but where information about use of such structures by mammals is included. Studies mostly report on the use of these structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.\nSee also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads and Install overpasses over roads/railways."
