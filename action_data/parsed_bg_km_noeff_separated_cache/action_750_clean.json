  "action_title": "Use pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: One randomised, replicated, controlled study from Finland found that threshold-based spraying regimes increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years but effects lasted for as little as three weeks. Pests and disease: Two of four studies from France, Malaysia and the USA reported that pests were satisfactorily controlled. One randomised, replicated, controlled study found pest numbers were similar under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes and one study reported that pest control was inadequate. A randomised, replicated, controlled study found mixed effects on disease severity. Crop damage: Four of five randomised, replicated, controlled studies from New Zealand, the Philippines and the USA found similar crop damage under threshold-based and conventional, preventative spraying regimes, but one study found damage increased. Another study found slightly less crop damage compared to unsprayed controls. Yield: Two of four randomised, replicated, controlled studies found similar yields under threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes. Two studies found mixed effects depending on site, year, pest stage/type or control treatment. Profit: Two of three randomised, replicated, controlled studies found similar profits using threshold-based and conventional spraying regimes. One study found effects varied between sites and years. Costs: Nine studies found fewer pesticide applications were needed and three studies found or predicted lower production costs.\nCrops studied were barley, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, celery, cocoa, cotton, grape, peanut, potato, rice, tomato and wheat.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis involves switching from conventional, preventative pesticide applications (e.g. spraying every week, month or season) to a regime that monitors pest numbers or crop damage and applies pesticides only when these reach economically damaging levels (thresholds). Spraying regimes can be evaluated by assessing the number of occasions on which pests reached economically damaging levels after decisions to spray/not spray. Strategically timing insecticide sprays to coincide with periods of likely pest abundance or natural enemy susceptibility (anticipated in advance based on prior knowledge, experience or predictive models) is included in 'Alter the timing of insectide use'. We use the term ‘pesticide’ to refer to insecticides (covering the majority of the evidence), fungicides and other chemicals to control non-plant organisms.\nHere we present evidence from 14 of 29 studies testing this intervention."
