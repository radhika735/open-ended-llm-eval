  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study found an increase in Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis population on a farm after the creation of skylark plots; a replicated, controlled study from the UK found higher densities of skylarks on fields with plots, compared to those without. No other studies investigated population-level effects.\nTwo UK studies, one replicated and controlled, found that skylark productivity was higher in plots or in fields with plots than in controls. One replicated and controlled study from Switzerland found no differences in productivity between territories that included plots and those that did not.\nTwo replicated studies (one controlled) from Denmark and Switzerland found that skylark plots were used by skylarks more than expected. A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that seed-eating songbirds did not use skylark plots more than surrounding crops.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis require short vegetation to nest in and skylark plots are small (usually 4â€“16 m2) undrilled patches within cereal fields that provide this, with little impact on overall yield. They are similar to lapwing plots (see above) but much smaller."
