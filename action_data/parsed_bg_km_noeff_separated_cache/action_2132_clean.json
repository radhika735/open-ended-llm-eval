  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies examined the effects of adding one or more mesh escape panels/windows to trawl nets on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Six were in the North Sea (Belgium, Netherlands, UK), two in the Thames estuary (UK), one in the English Channel (UK), and one in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nOverall survival (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the English Channel and the North Sea found that fitting nets with either one of seven designs of square mesh escape panels (varying mesh size and twine type) led to higher survival rates of invertebrates that escaped the nets compared to unmodified nets.\nUnwanted catch overall abundance (7 studies): Three of seven replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea, the Thames estuary, the English Channel and the Gulf of Carpentaria  found that trawl nets fitted with one or more mesh escape panels/windows/zones reduced the unwanted catch of invertebrates compared to unmodified nets. Two found mixed effects of fitting escape panels on the unwanted catch of invertebrates and fish depending on the panel design. Two found that trawl nets fitted with escape panels  caught similar amounts of unwanted invertebrates and fish compared to unmodified nets.\n\nOTHERS (7 STUDIES)\n\nCommercially targeted catch abundance (7 studies): Three of seven replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea, the Thames estuary, the English Channel and the Gulf of Carpentaria, found that trawl nets fitted with one or more mesh escape panels/windows/zones caught similar amounts of all or most commercial species to unmodified nets. Three found mixed effects of fitting escape panels on the catch of all or most commercial species depending on the species and/or panel design. One found that trawl nets fitted with escape panels reduced the catch of commercial species compared to unmodified nets.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The net is wide at the opening and narrows to a bag or ‘codend’, tied at the end with a drawstring, where organisms are trapped. Trawl nets can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. Standard trawl nets are made from diamond-shaped mesh. To potentially reduce the amount of unwanted organisms, a net can be modified by fitting one or more mesh “escape panels” in the outer mesh of the net before the codend (Brčić et al. 2017; Fonteyne & Polet 2002; Revill & Jennings 2005). These panels are sections of netting made from a different mesh design than the rest of the net, for instance made from square mesh or large diamond mesh. The panels are designed to allow smaller unwanted organisms to escape, while retaining the commercially targeted ones. Mesh panels, which are also referred to as escape windows, escape zones, and drop-out panels, or more generally as “bycatch reduction devices”, can be fitted directly before the codend, or elsewhere on the main body of the net such as behind the groundrope. Here, we included escape zones such as “Bigeye” and “Fisheye” devices, as although they do not strictly use mesh sections, they have similar functions of letting organisms escape through a specific area of the net.\n \nBrčić J., Herrmann B. & Sala A.
