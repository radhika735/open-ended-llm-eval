  "action_title": "Primates: Provide nectar (including artificial nectar)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of providing nectar (including artificial nectar) to primates.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNectar forms a significant component of the wild diets of many species of primate (Sussman 1978, Cabana et al. 2014). In captivity providing nectar offers primates the opportunity to manipulate their food with their feed and hands to extract the nectar, expecially if given in line with an enrichment device.\nCabana F. & Plowman A. (2014) Pygmy slow loris Nycticebus pygmaeus – natural diet replication in captivity. Endangered Species Research, 23, 197-204.\nSussman R. (1978). Nectar-feeding by prosimians and its evolutionary and ecological implications. In: Chivers D, Joysey K, editors. Recent Advances in Promatology. New York, NY, USA, Academic Press pp. 119–126."
