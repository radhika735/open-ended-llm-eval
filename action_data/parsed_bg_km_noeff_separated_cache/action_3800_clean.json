  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of relocating nests/eggs for artificial incubation on tuatara populations. Both studies were in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study) in New Zealand reported that hatching success of tuatara eggs relocated for artificial incubation was 86–100%. The other study reported hatching success of 44%.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in New Zealand found that 10 months after hatching, artificially incubated tuatara were larger that those from natural nests.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRelocating eggs to artificially incubate them may be used as a way to maximise hatching success as the eggs will no longer be vulnerable to natural threats such as predation. Consideration must be given to the potential impacts of incubation conditions (for example temperature and humidity) on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of reptile hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006).\nThis action includes studies where eggs are incubated in artificial conditions, which ranges from controlled laboratory settings to using polystyrene boxes to incubate eggs in buildings. Studies are also included where gravid females are brought into captivity to lay eggs, but eggs are taken away from the females for artificial incubation.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards or Crocodilians.\nFor studies that discuss the effects of relocating and re-burying eggs in natural habitats to avoid threats, see Relocate nests/eggs to a hatchery and Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries).\nSee also Maintain wild-caught, gravid females in captivity during gestation and Alter incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratio.\nBooth D.T.
