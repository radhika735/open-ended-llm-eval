  "action_title": "Add woody debris to protect seeds/plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of adding woody debris to protect seeds/plants on grassland vegetation. The study was in Kenya.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Kenya found that sowing buffel grass seeds beside woody debris did not affect seedling survival.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn natural grasslands, the survival and growth of some plant species may be positively influenced by another plant species as a result of protection from drought or from grazing (Brooker et al. 2008). This observation has led to the use of nurse plants – where the seeds of plants are sown underneath other existing plants in the hope that this will improve their chances of establishment. Adding woody debris for protection is a modification of this idea, where woody debris is added to increase the likelihood that plants sown underneath the debris will survive.\nBrooker, R.W., Maestre, F.T., Callaway, R.M., Lortie, C.L., Cavieres, L.A., Kunstler, G., Liancourt, P., Tielbörger, K., Travis, J.M.J., Anthelme, F., Armas, C., Coll, L., Corcket, E., Delzon, S., Forey, E., Kikvidze, Z., Olofsson, J., Pugnaire, F., Quiroz, C.L., Saccone, P., Schiffers, K., Seifan, M., Touzard, B. & Michalet, R.
