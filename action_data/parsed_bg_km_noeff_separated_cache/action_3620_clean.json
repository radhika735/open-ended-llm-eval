  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of introducing fishing gear exchange programs to encourage fishers to use gear that reduces unwanted catch of reptiles.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntroducing fishing gear exchange programmes may encourage fishers to use gear types that reduce the unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of aquatic reptiles. Fishers may be provided with alternative gear types that are less harmful to reptiles after surrendering their existing gear. Training on the use of new fishing gear may also be required.\nSee also: Involve fishers in designing and trialling new fishing gear types to encourage uptake of gear that reduces unwanted catch of reptiles and Finance low interest loans to convert to fishing gear that reduces unwanted catch of reptiles."
