  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on marine and freshwater mammals of setting and enforcing vessel speed limits. One study was in the Indian River estuarine system (USA) and the other in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the Indian River estuarine system found similar numbers of manatee deaths before and after vessel speed limits were set in ‘zones’, but fewer deaths were recorded after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. One before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntroducing vessel speed limits may reduce disturbance and the risk of lethal collisions and severe injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Vanderlaan & Taggart 2007, Currie et al.  2017, Chion et al. 2018). Speed limits may be permanent, seasonal (e.g. during migration, breeding, or nursing periods) or temporary (e.g. in response to mammal sightings within an area) and may apply to all vessels or to certain vessel types or sizes. Speed limits may also be mandatory or voluntary, although greater compliance has been reported with mandatory speed limits (Lagueux et al. 2011). Enforcement may be required if compliance is low (Silber et al. 2014). \nThis intervention is often combined with changes to shipping routes, see Divert shipping routes.\nChion C., Turgeon S., Cantin G., Michaud R., Ménard N., Lesage V., Parrott L., Beaufils P., Clermont Y. & Gravel C.
