  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using holding pens or enclosures at release sites prior to release of captive-bred reptiles. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the USA found that survival of captive-bred smooth green snakes and desert tortoises held in pens before release was similar over 3–5 months or 2–3 years compared to individuals released directly.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One controlled study in the USA found that movement of smooth green snakes held in pens before release was similar compared to snakes that were released directly.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHolding pens or enclosures at release sites (sometimes termed ‘soft release’) may be used to enable reptiles to become accustomed to new surroundings before release and may contain some natural habitat and burrows. Pens or enclosures may increase the chance that released animals will settle at the release site, potentially increasing the chance that the release will be successful. Captive-bred, naïve animals in particular may benefit from the acclimation period that holding pens provide.\nThis action discusses studies that test the effectiveness of placing captive-bred individuals into holding pens at the release site prior to release.
