  "action_title": "Remove woody debris after timber harvest",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne of six studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in the USA and France found that woody debris removal increased understory vegetation cover. Three studies found no effect or mixed effects on cover. Four of the studies found no effect or mixed effects on understory vegetation species richness and diversity and two found no effect of woody debris removal on coverand species diversity of trees.\nSix studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Canada, Ethiopia, Spain and the USA examined the effect of woody debris removal on young trees. One study found that debris removal increased young tree density, another study found that it decreased young tree density, and three studies found mixed effects or no effect on young tree density. One found no effect of woody-debris removal on young tree survival.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCoarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches (&gt; 10 cm diameter) that are left during tree harvesting. Removal of coarse woody debris uncovers the ground and allows sunlight to reach it, which may enhance seed germination and increase plant biodiversity."
