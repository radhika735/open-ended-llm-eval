  "action_title": "Limit the density of livestock on farmland near peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of limiting the density of livestock on farmland near peatlands.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWaste products from livestock can run off agricultural land and flow into peatlands. This is a particular problem when land is compacted due to trampling by many animals. Excess nutrients in peatlands could reduce their ability to support their characteristic, and sometimes diverse, vegetation. Reducing the number of livestock on land near peatlands would reduce the amount of excrement and compaction, potentially reducing nutrient inputs to peatlands.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: interventions to reduce the impact of livestock grazing directly on peatlands i.e. use barriers to protect pristine peatlands; exclude or remove livestock from degraded peatlands; reduce intensity of grazing; change type of livestock; change season/timing of grazing."
