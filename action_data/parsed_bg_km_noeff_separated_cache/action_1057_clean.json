  "action_title": "Red-eared terrapin:  Draining invaded waterbodies",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the impact of draining invaded waterbodies on reduction of red-eared terrapin populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDraining invaded waterbodies may offer a tool for localised management of red-eared terrapin Trachemys scripta populations, provided potentially negative side effects on native species are carefully managed.  Following draining, red eared terrapins may burrow into the silt at the bottom of the waterbody.  For example, a field trial in Queensland, Australia drained a small irrigation dam and found that red-eared terrapins burrowed to a depth of up to 2 m in the silt at the bottom and had to be removed by mechanical excavator (O’Keefe 2009).  The silt was spread in a secure area, raked, and any red-eared terrapins present were removed by hand.  To prevent red-eared terrapins from emigrating during the draining process, the site was first secured with barrier fences and pitfall traps.  No additional details about the methods or results were provided.\nO’Keefe S.
