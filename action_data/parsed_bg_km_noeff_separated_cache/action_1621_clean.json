  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting spiny shrubs to act as barriers to people on shrublands.\n\n'We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanting spiny shrubs in sensitive shrubland areas may help to reduce access by people therefore reducing negative impacts such as trampling. However, planting of some spiny plants, such as cacti can result in spread of invasive species (Essl & Kobler 2009; Novoa et al. 2015). As such any use of this intervention should first assess the potential risks associated with introducing spiny plants, particularly if they are not-native to the region of interest.\nEssl, F. & Kobler, J. (2009) Spiny invaders – Patterns and determinants of cacti invasion in Europe. Flora - Morphology, Distribution, Functional Ecology of Plants, 204, 485-494.\nNovoa, A., Kaplan, H., Kumschick, S., Wilson, J.R.U. & Richardson, D.M. (2015) Soft Touch or Heavy Hand?
