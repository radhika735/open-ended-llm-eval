  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing shipping along inland waterways on freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHigh levels of industrial and commercial ship traffic along inland waterways may result in disturbance and collision mortality of freshwater mammals, such as river dolphins (Van Waerebeek et al. 2007). This intervention involves reducing shipping along inland waterways, e.g. by using alternative modes of transport.\nSee also Limit vessel traffic in shallow rivers.\nVan Waerebeek K., Baker A., Félix F., Gedamke J., Iñiguez M., Sanino G.P., Secchi E.R., Sutaria D., Helden A.V. & Wang Y.
