  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using repellents to reduce cable gnawing. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that repellents only deterred cable gnawing by northern pocket gophers when encased in shrink-tubing.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHuman-wildlife conflict can arise where animals cause damage to equipment or installations. Damage, such as that caused by gophers to underground cables, can represent substantial financial losses (Ramey & McCann 1997). If repellents can reduce or prevent damage to cables, this might reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.\nRamey C.A. & McCann G.R. (1997) Evaluating cable resistance to pocket gopher damage-a review. Great Plains Wildlife Damage Control Workshop, 13, 107–113."
