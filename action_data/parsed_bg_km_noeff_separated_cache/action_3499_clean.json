  "action_title": "Use fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere is a risk to reptiles from becoming trapped, falling into mining pits or being electrocuted in mining or energy production facilities. Fencing may be used around such sites to deter reptile entry. As well as reducing direct risks to reptiles, if successful the intervention may also reduce the need to carry out lethal control of reptiles on such sites."
