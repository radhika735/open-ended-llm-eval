  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of retaining forested corridors in logged areas on bat populations. The three studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that bat activity (relative abundance) was significantly higher along the edges of forested corridors than in corridor interiors or in adjacent logged stands, which had similar activity levels.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)   \n\nUse (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found more Seminole bats roosting in forested corridors than logged stands or mature forest. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found more male but fewer female evening bats roosting in forested corridors than logged stands.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves retaining corridors of unlogged mature forest within logged areas. This may provide foraging and roosting opportunities for bats and maintain connectivity in disturbed landscapes. See also ‘Retain riparian buffers in logged areas’.\nTo be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared logged areas where forested corridors have been kept intact with similar/nearby logged areas where forested corridors have not been kept. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the forested corridors and the study must state when the intervention was carried out."
