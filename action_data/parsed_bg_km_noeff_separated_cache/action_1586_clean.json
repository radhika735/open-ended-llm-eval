  "action_title": "Plant indigenous fast-growing trees (will not necessarily resemble original community) in clear-cut areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of planting indigenous fast-growing trees in clear-cut areas on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves the planting of indigenous fast-growing trees after clear-cutting. Because the focus of this intervention is to regrow a forest in a relatively short period of time with the aid of fast-growing indigenous trees, the planted forest will not necessarily resemble the original forest community when it has fully regrown. In addition, it should be noted that natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests. Therefore, this intervention should only be considered if the natural habitat is already lost or if preserving it will not be possible.\n            In terms of facilitating the establishment and growth of indigenous tree species in severely degraded areas, plantations of fast-growing trees have been shown to facilitate the establishment and growth of indigenous tree species. For example, Zanne & Chapman (2001) found that five plantations in Kibale National Park in Uganda had higher tree species richness and stem density than nearby human-modified grasslands from which they were derived.\n \nZanne A. & Chapman C.A.
