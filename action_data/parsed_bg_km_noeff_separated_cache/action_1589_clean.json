  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in Tanzania found that a reintroduced population of chimpanzees increased in size after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals, alongside other interventions. One study in Senegal found that an infant chimpanzee was reunited with its mother after reintroduction, alongside other interventions.\nTwo studies in Brazil and Thailand found that populations of reintroduced primates declined after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals, alongside other interventions.\nFour studies in French Guiana, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam found that a minority of primates survived after between two months and one year after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals, alongside other interventions. One study in Vietnam found that half of introduced primates survived after two months.\nOne study in Brazil found that an abandoned infant muriqui was reunited with its mother after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals, alongside other interventions. One study in Indonesia found that Bornean agile gibbons had similar behaviour and diet to wild populations after reintroduction as single/multiple individuals, alongside other interventions.\nOne controlled study in Malaysia found that a reintroduced population of orangutans declined in size after reintroduction, alongside other interventions. One study in Malaysia found that 98% of orangutans survived release after reintroduction, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFor the purpose of the primate synopsis, the scientific evidence for reintroductions is separated into six different interventions, which refer to slightly different methodological approaches (see sections 12.15-12.20):\n1) ‘Reintroduce primates in groups’\n2) ‘Reintroduce primates as single/multiple individuals’\n3) ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is absent’\n4) ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is present’\n5) ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat without predators’\n6) ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat with predators’"
