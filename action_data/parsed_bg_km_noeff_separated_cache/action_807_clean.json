  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of providing shelter habitat on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanting trees or scrub can act as a windbreak and create a warm microclimate around breeding sites. Alternatively, management such as increasing tree canopies can help to provide shade from the sun to reduce temperatures where they become too high."
