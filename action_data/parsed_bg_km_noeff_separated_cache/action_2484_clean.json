  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing artificial waterholes in the dry season. One study was in South Africa, one was in Tanzania and one was in Jordan.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A site comparison study in Tanzania found that artificial waterholes were used by a similar number of large mammal species as was a natural waterhole.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): A study in South Africa found that areas around artificial waterholes were used more by eight out of 13 mammalian herbivore species than was the wider landscape. A study in Jordan found that artificial waterholes were used by striped hyenas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn response to reduced availability of natural water sources for mammals, artificial water holes may be constructed. These can help to enhance survival during drought periods. However, there are also concerns about negative effects on mammals from artificial waterholes, such as there being increased numbers of some common water-dependent species at expense of rarer herbivores (Smuts 1978), or that artificial waterholes maintain high populations that are then vulnerable to starvation (Walker at al. 1987).\nSmuts G.L. (1978) Interrelations between predators, prey and their environment. Bioscience, 28, 316–320.\nWalker B.H., Emslie R.H., Owen-Smith R.N., Scholes R.J.
