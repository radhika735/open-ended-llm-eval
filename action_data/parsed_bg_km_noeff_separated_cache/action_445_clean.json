  "action_title": "Provide supplementary food to increase parental presence and so reduce brood parasitism",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on providing supplementary food to increase parental presence and so reduce boord parasitims on bird populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBrood parasites only tend to lay in host nests when the parents are absent, to reduce the risk of eggs being rejected. Therefore, maximising the time parent birds spend at their nest may reduce the incidence of parasitism. One possible way of doing this would be to provide supplementary food, meaning that birds have to spend less time foraging. Studies discussing this and other uses of supplementary feeding are discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’."
