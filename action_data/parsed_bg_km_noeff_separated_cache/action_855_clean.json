  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo of four studies (including two replicated studies) in Denmark, Germany, the UK and USA found that translocating eggs and/or adults established common toad breeding populations. One found populations of garlic toads established at two of four sites. One found that breeding populations of boreal toads were not established.\nOne before-and-after study in Denmark found that translocating green toad eggs to existing populations, along with aquatic and terrestrial habitat management, increased population numbers. \nThree studies (including one before-and-after study) in Germany, Italy and the USA found that 33â€“100% of translocated adult toads reproduced, 19% survived up to six years or some metamorphs survived over winter. One replicated study in South Africa found that translocated Cape platanna metamorphs survived up to 23 years at one of four sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs there is a larger literature for natterjack toads Bufo calamita than other species, evidence is considered in a separate section."
