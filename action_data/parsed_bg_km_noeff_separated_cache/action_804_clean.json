  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nOne study investigating the effect of applying water to an amphibian site is outlined in ‘Threat: Energy production and mining - Artificially mist habitat to keep it damp’.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConservation of some species may require intensive management such as the redistribution of water resources. This could be achieved by using irrigation systems. Irrigation sprayers have been used to manipulate water at toadlet breeding sites (Mitchell 2001).\nMitchell, N.J. (2001) Males call more from wetter nests: effects of substrate water potential on reproductive behaviours of terrestrial toadlets. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 268, 87–93."
