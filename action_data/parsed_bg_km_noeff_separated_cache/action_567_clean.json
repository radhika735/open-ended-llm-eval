  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated study from Indonesia found that up to 78% of maleo Macrocephalon maleo eggs hatched after translocation, with higher success if eggs were reburied as they were found. There was only anecdotal evidence that the translocations increased local populations.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMegapodes are a family of birds found in East Asia, Australasia and Oceania that build large nest mounds filled with vegetation which rots to heat and incubate the eggs. The chicks are extremely independent and can run immediately after hatching, with some species even able to fly on the day they hatch. As eggs are not incubated by parents, they can be translocated and re-buried elsewhere."
