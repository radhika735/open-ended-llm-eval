  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of prohibiting activities that cause disturbance in sensitive areas for marine mammals. One study was in the Kattegat Sea (Denmark) and one in the Indian Ocean (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Kattegat sea found that harbour porpoise activity increased at a stony reef after fishing was prohibited and the reef was restored with boulders.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that a beach where human access was fully prohibited had fewer Australian sea lions showing aggression or retreating compared to a beach where access was partly prohibited.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere are many human activities that may cause disturbance and harm to marine and freshwater mammals and their habitats. This intervention involves prohibiting any such activity that may cause disturbance in particularly sensitive areas for marine and freshwater mammals. For example, in important feeding or resting grounds.\nFor studies that involve prohibiting activities as part of legal protection of an area, see Legally protect habitat for marine and freshwater mammals."
