  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf four studies found, one paired sites study from the USA found that bird species richness was similar in burned and unburned aspen forests, although there were significant changes in the relative abundances of some species. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found no evidence for changes in community composition in oak and hickory forests following burning.\nA replicated controlled trial from the USA found no differences in wood thrush nest survival in burned compared to unburned areas. Another replicated controlled trial from the USA found a reduction in the number of black-chinned hummingbird nests following fuel reduction treatments that included burning.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nControlled burning of accumulated litter (fuel reduction) may reduce the risk of hotter, more extensive and potentially more damaging, wildfires in temperate woodland habitats (e.g. Wooller & Brooker 1980). Periodic prescribed burns may also be used to reinstate/restore ecosystem processes in forests historically subject to occasional wildfires but where active fire suppression has occurred, often over many decades. Changes likely to occur with burning include a reduction in hardwood understorey vegetation and an increase in grasses and herbaceous vegetation. Other habitat modifications or interventions may be undertaken in combination with fire, such as thinning trees or the removal of mid- and understorey vegetation. Sometimes conflicts arise as to conservation priorities and possible detrimental effects on non-target species or communities.\nWooller, R.D. & Brooker, K.S., 1980. The effects of controlled burning on some birds of the understorey in karri forest. Emu, 80, pp.165â€“166."
