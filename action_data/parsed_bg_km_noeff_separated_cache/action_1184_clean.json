  "action_id": "1184",
  "action_title": "Provide paraffin stoves",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of providing paraffin stoves on forests.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn many areas wood is the main fuel used for cooking and heating. The high demand for firewood can lead to strong pressure on forests. By providing alternative stoves that do not require wood (such as paraffin stoves), less wood is required, which may lead to reduced exploitation of forests."
