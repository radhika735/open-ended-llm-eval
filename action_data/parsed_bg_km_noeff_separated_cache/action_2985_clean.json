  "action_title": "Abandon mined land: allow brackish/saline marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning formerly mined land with the expectation that brackish/saline marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. The study was in France.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity types (1 study): One replicated study in France simply classified the plant community types that developed on abandoned salt pans. Areas flooded for at least part of the year developed salt marsh plant communities, with the exact community composition depending on the duration of flooding and soil salinity.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIt may be possible that marshes or swamps will recover on their own, without any active intervention, if human activities are stopped. Such passive recovery can be cheaper than active intervention and allow development of a community well adapted to local conditions. However, plant colonization may not occur at all or, if it does, occur slowly or be dominated by invasive species (Zahawi et al. 2014). Successful recovery may be hindered by physical degradation (e.g. a water table that is too low, restricted tidal exchange, compacted sediment), chemical degradation (e.g. acidified soils or presence of heavy metals) or an insufficient supply of propagules.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have monitored historically mined land that has been abandoned (mining activities completely stopped, with no additional intervention) with the expectation that marshes or swamps could recover (i.e. excluding studies of abandoned upland mines). Therefore, the summarized evidence is best considered as an indication of what kind of vegetation can develop in historically mined areas, and how long it takes to develop, rather than a complete survey of all relevant evidence.\nRelated actions: Abandon cropland; Abandon plantations.\nZahawi R.A., Reid J.L. & Holl K.D.
