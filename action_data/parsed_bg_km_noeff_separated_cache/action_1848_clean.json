  "action_title": "Provide education or training programmes about peatlands or peatland management",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of peatland education/training programmes on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. Both studies were in tropical peat swamps.\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One study in peat swamps in Indonesia reported that over 3,500 households adopted sustainable farming practices following workshops about sustainable farming. One before-and-after study in peat swamps in Indonesia reported that a training course on rubber farming increased the quality of rubber produced by local farmers.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the effects of education programmes, training courses or workshops, generally aimed at people who manage peatlands (landowners, land managers, local people). They may be about peatlands in general (e.g. their wildlife, their value to humans) or about management techniques (including sustainable land use practices). They may be specifically about peatland vegetation or about broader aspects of peatland ecosystems.\nAs an example, the ‘Bogathon’ and ‘Sphagathon’ programmes in the UK involved a range of land managers (from private estates, landowner organizations, conservation organizations and water companies) in discussions about the most desirable state for upland bogs and how to achieve it (BASC n.d.). In tropical peat swamps, blocking drainage canals can ultimately reduce fire risk, restore forest and create aquaculture ponds. Discussions with local people may alleviate concerns over the immediate loss of transport routes and ensure the blockages remain in place (Page et al. 2009).\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: adopt voluntary agreements or pay landowners to protect peatlands, because these schemes are often linked with education or training; allow sustainable use of peatlands, possibly supported by education/training programmes.\nBASC (n.d.)
