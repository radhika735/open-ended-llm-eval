  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nScrub may consist of vegetation dominated by bushes, shrubs and tree saplings (Mortimer et al. 2000). Scrub on farmland can add habitat complexity and heterogeneity. However, if scrub dominates non-productive land on farms it may lead to declines in species that require grassland and other farmland habitats. Scrub control may include cutting, grazing or herbicide application (Mortimer et al. 2000).\nMortimer S.R., Turner A.J., Brown V.K., Fuller R.J., Good J.E.G., Bell S.A.
