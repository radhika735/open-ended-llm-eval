  "action_title": "Remove vegetation that could compete with planted peatland vegetation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of removing competing plants to aid planted peatland vegetation. The study was in a bog.\nSurvival (1 study): One controlled study in a bog in the UK reported that some Sphagnum moss survived when sown (in gel beads) into a plot where purple moor grass had previously been cut, but no moss survived in a plot where grass had not been cut.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRemoving other plants before or after planting peatland vegetation could reduce competition for space, light and nutrients. Survival and growth of planted vegetation may be improved. Note that abundant competitors, and/or the absence of the vegetation to be introduced, could be symptoms of inappropriate physical conditions that may also need to be managed.\nCaution: Existing vegetation may help planted vegetation to establish, protecting it from extreme temperatures, strong sunlight and desiccation.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: interventions to control competing plants without introducing vegetation (e.g. cutting/mowing or applying herbicide); introduce nurse plants with or without introducing peatland vegetation."
