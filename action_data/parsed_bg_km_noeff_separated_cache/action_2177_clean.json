  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing pollution emergency plans on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSudden acute pollution events, for instance oil spills, can cause serious disturbances and harm to marine life (White et al. 2012). Pollution emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, in case of a pollution event. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of response, should a pollution event occur (Li et al. 2016; Qiao et al. 2002). Establishing emergency plans may benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates through a faster response and a more efficient control of the pollution, should such event occur.\n \nLi P., Cai Q., Lin W., Chen B. & Zhang B.
