  "action_title": "Relocate marine and freshwater mammals following oil spills",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of relocating marine and freshwater mammals following oil spills.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf an oil spill has the potential to affect marine and freshwater mammals and there is sufficient warning, it may be possible to temporarily relocate mammals away from the danger. However, this may be expensive and there is the risk that relocated mammals will not be able to return to the original site and/or may have a negative impact on native populations. Some mammals may also attempt to return before clean-up operations are complete."
