  "action_title": "Add lime or similar chemicals before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Two studies were in Canada. One study was in the USA. One study was in a greenhouse.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada reported that liming reduced the above-ground biomass of planted salt marsh vegetation after one year.\nIndividual species abundance (2 studies): One controlled study in former borrow pits in the USA found that limed and unlimed plots supported similar biomass of a planted herb species after 1–2 growing seasons. In contrast, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in salt-contaminated peat in Canada found that limed pots supported lower biomass of two sown herb species than unlimed pots, after four months.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in salt-contaminated peat in Canada found that for each of two sown herb species, germination rates were similar in limed and unlimed pots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves adding chemicals – such as lime (CaO or Ca(OH)2), limestone (CaCO3), magnesium oxide (MgO), fly ash (residue from burning coal) and biochar (a type of charcoal) – to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. These calcium and/or magnesium-rich chemicals may reduce acidity and modify nutrient availability (Weil & Brady 2016), potentially increasing plant survival or growth.\nRelated actions: Add lime or similar chemicals to wetlands, other than to complement planting.\nWeil R.R. & Brady N.C.
