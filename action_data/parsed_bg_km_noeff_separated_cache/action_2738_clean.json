  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of deploying patrol boats on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Compliance with these measures is important to protect commercially targeted and non-targeted species and their habitats: non-compliance has been shown to have a negative impact on the biomass of targeted species in no-take marine reserves (Bergseth et al. 2013). One way to enforce compliance is to deploy dedicated fisheries patrol boats. Fisheries enforcement patrols have the powers to board vessels to inspect for non-compliance and any illegal activity and heavy financial penalties can be issued. These may act as deterrents to fishers and help prevent attempts at illegal fishing altogether. The fish resource and habitats may thus be sustained or conserved by ensuring that the aims of management regulations have the best chance of being met.\nBergseth B.J., Russ G.R. & Cinner J.E. (2015) Measuring and monitoring compliance in no-take marine reserves. Fish and Fisheries, 16, 240–258."
