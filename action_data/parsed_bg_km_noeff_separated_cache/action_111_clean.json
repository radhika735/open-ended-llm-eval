  "action_title": "Manage wild deer numbers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe have captured no evidence for the effects of managing wild deer numbers on farmland wildlife.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention involves controlling numbers of wild deer on farmland. Wild deer populations can cause damage to woodlands, crops and other wildlife habitats through browsing and bark stripping. The introduction of non-native deer species to the UK and a lack of predators to naturally control deer populations mean that management of deer numbers may be required to prevent damage to farmland habitats (Mayle 1999).\nMayle B. (1999) Managing deer in the countryside – practice note July 1999. Forestry Commission, Edinburgh, UK."
