  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of legally protecting reptile species on their populations. Two studies were in the Netherlands and one was in each of the USA, Australia, the Seychelles and Cape Verde.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two studies (including one replicated, site comparison study and one before-and-after study) in the USA and Australia found that waterbodies where turtle harvesting was prohibited had a similar abundance of red-eared sliders and Texas spiny softshell turtles compared to unprotected waterbodies. The other study found that following legal protection and harvest regulation, the density of saltwater crocodile populations increased.\nReproductive success (1 studies): One before-and-after study in the Seychelles found that following legal protection of both green turtles and their habitat, nesting activity increased.\nCondition (2 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, site comparison study and one before-and-after study) in the USA and Australia found that in areas with legal protection and/or harvest regulation, Texas spiny softshell turtles and saltwater crocodiles were larger than in areas with no protection or before protection began. One study also found that female red-eared sliders were larger, but males were a similar size in protected compared to unprotected waterbodies.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 studies)\n\nHuman behaviour change (3 studies): Two reviews in the Netherlands found that despite legislation protecting reptiles and their habitat, only one of four development projects completed their habitat compensation requirements or that compensatory slow worm habitat was not completed in time. Both studies also found that monitoring data was not available or that the success of a slow worm mitigation translocation could not be assessed. One replicated, before-and-after study in Cape Verde reported that following legal protections combined with public awareness campaigns, self-reported harvesting, selling and purchasing of sea turtles and turtle products decreased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLegal protection can be given to species on a national or international scale. Levels of protection vary for species and may include protection against killing, capturing, disturbing or trading, or damaging or destroying breeding sites or resting places. Legal protection may be complete (for example no take) or partial (for example limitations to harvest that are seasonal or location specific).\nDepending on the level of protection, individual species protection may mean that habitats are also protected. This means that activities such as development that are likely to affect protected species and their habitat may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.\nOther studies that discuss legal protection of reptiles are included in Threat: Biological resource use – Regulate wildlife harvesting and Habitat protection – Protect habitat. For studies that look at the effect of specific action plans for species recovery see Develop/implement species recovery plans."
