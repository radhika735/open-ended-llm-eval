  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in the UK found that grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads. Five studies (including four replicated studies) in Denmark, Estonia and the UK found that habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing increased green toad populations, maintained or increased natterjack toad populations and maintained common toad populations. \nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that the decline in amphibian species was similar under traditional season-long or intensive-early cattle stocking.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLivestock grazing changes habitats in a number of ways such as reducing vegetation height, changing plant diversity, creating openings for seed growth and preventing reed and shrub growth. Such changes can have beneficial or detrimental effects on amphibian populations, depending on the amphibian species, grazing intensity and timing.\nFor an intervention that aims to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing see ‘Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’."
