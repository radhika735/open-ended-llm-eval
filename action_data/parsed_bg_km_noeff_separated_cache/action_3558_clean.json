  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of promoting knowledge exchange between fishers to improve good practice. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that following the introduction of a tool to help facilitate knowledge exchange and the avoidance of loggerhead turtles, loggerhead turtle bycatch was similar compared to the two years before the tool was introduced.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\nHuman behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that following the introduction of a tool to help facilitate avoidance of loggerhead turtles, fishers did not spend less time fishing in the areas recommended for avoidance by the tool.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishers commonly share information through social relationships, and this may lead to increased fishing success (Turner et al. 2014). However, knowledge exchange between fishers could also be used as a tool to help promote sustainable practices, particularly if the central fishers in information-sharing networks can be identified and co-opted to assist managers in the spreading of conservation information (Mbaru & Barnes 2017).\nMbaru E.K. & Barnes M.L.
