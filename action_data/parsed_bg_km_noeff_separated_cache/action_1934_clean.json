  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n‘Greenfield sites’ are areas of previously undeveloped land within urban areas, such as agricultural and amenity land, forests, parks and gardens. Such sites may provide important habitat for wildlife and act as wildlife corridors. However, greenfield sites are frequently built upon with the growing pressure for urban development. See also ‘Create or restore bat foraging habitat in urban areas’."
