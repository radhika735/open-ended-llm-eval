  "action_title": "Implement monitoring surveillance strategies (e.g. SMART) or use monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Nigeria found that more gorillas and chimpanzees were observed after the implementation of law enforcement and a monitoring system.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention entails using surveillance strategies, such as SMART (http://smartconservationtools.org/), or monitoring data, such as spatial data on hunting intensity and/or primate density, to improve the efficiency of law enforcement patrols. For example, an analysis by N’Goran et al. (2012) of monitoring and patrol data from Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, found that patrol teams spent more time in areas of high human activity and poaching, implying that the monitoring data helped to guide law enforcement patrols to areas where hunting was concentrated, thereby increasing their efficiency. However, the study did not relate patrol effort to primate densities and therefore conclusions could not be drawn about the effectiveness of patrols.\n            The regular patrolling of primate habitat by anti-poaching teams and the removing of snares by snare-removal teams that may form part of anti-poaching patrols are discussed separately under ‘Conduct regular anti-poaching patrols’ and ‘Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares’. The training and the providing of equipment to anti-poaching patrols is discussed under ‘Provide training to anti-poaching ranger patrols’, and ‘Provide better equipment (e.g. guns) to anti-poaching ranger patrols’.\n \nN’Goran P., Boesch C., Mundry R., N’Goran E.N., Herbinger I., Yapi F.A. & Kühl H.S.
