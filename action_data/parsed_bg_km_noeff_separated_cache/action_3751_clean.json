  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of creating or restoring shrubland on reptile populations. This study was in Mexico.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Mexico found that areas of restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness compared to areas that were not restored.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Mexico found that areas of restored shrubland had a higher abundance of lizards than areas that were not restored.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLoss of shrubland may be due to a range of factors, including too many grazing animals inhibiting regeneration of shrubs, too few grazing animals or fire suppression leading to reversion to woodland, or invasion by non-native species. Shrubland restoration or creation may benefit reptiles associated with the habitat."
