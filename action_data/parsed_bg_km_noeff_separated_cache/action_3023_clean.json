  "action_title": "Physically exclude pedestrians",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically excluding pedestrians from marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWalking on marshes or swamps can damage their vegetation, soils and hydrology (e.g. Ross 2006; Woolfolk 1999). This is a particular problem when the same area is repeatedly crossed e.g. in popular hiking areas, in tourist sites/nature reserves, or when scientists make repeat visits to sample plots. Pedestrians could be physically excluded from pristine areas to prevent damage, or from degraded areas to let them recover. Physical barriers could be fences, fallen trees or water/wet ground.\nRelated actions: Restrict pedestrian access, using non-physical means such as signs or voluntary codes; Install boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling.\nRoss P.M. (2006) Macrofaunal loss and microhabitat destruction: the impact of trampling in a temperate mangrove forest, NSW Australia. Wetlands Ecology and Management, 14, 167–184.\nWoolfolk A.M. (1999) Effects of human trampling and cattle grazing on salt marsh assemblages in Elkhorn Slough, California. Masters Thesis, California State University, USA."
