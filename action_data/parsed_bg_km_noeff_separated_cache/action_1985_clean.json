  "action_title": "Retain riparian buffers in logged areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining riparian buffers in logged areas on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves retaining unlogged buffers along streams and rivers in logged areas. This may provide foraging and roosting opportunities for bats and maintain connectivity in disturbed landscapes. A study in Australia found that riparian buffers in logged areas had similar overall bat activity and species richness to unlogged mature forest (Lloyd et al. 2006). See also ‘Retain forested corridors in logged areas’.\nTo be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared logged areas where riparian buffers have been kept intact with similar/nearby logged areas where riparian buffers have not been kept. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the riparian buffer and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.\nFor a similar intervention relevant to agriculture, see ‘Retain riparian buffers on agricultural land’. For an intervention that involves planting riparian buffers to reduce pollution, see ‘Plant riparian buffer strips’.\nLloyd A., Law B. & Goldingay R.
