  "action_title": "Carnivores: Provide food during natural active periods",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of providing food during natural active periods.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the wild, carnivorous species have a range of different circadian rhythms, hunting or foraging at different times of the day. This could be due to food abundance, temperature or physical adaptations. Providing food during natural active periods aims to replicate wild-type behavioural rhythms."
