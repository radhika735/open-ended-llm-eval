  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial and recreational vessels can generate large amounts of garbage and solid waste (Butt 2007). Wastes discharged overboard from vessels can sink to the seabed and impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area may reduce or stop the source of pollution and allow subtidal benthic invertebrates to recover over time. However, solid waste can accumulate and subsist in the marine environment for a long time due to very slow degradation (Andrady 2015; Pham et al. 2014), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting discharge alone might not be sufficient.\nEvidence for intervention related to the discharge of waste effluents is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels”.\n \nAndrady A.L.
