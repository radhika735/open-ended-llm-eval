  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo before-and-after studies in Belize found that black howler monkey numbers increased by 61-138% over 3–13 years after the implementation of a multimedia campaign or the opening of a museum for wildlife education, alongside other interventions.\nTwo before-and-after studies in Brazil and Colombia found that the implementation of education programs focusing on tamarins improved attitudes towards- and knowledge about tamarins.\nOne study in the Republic of Congo found that large numbers of people were informed about lowland gorillas through multimedia campaigns using theatre and film.\nOne before-and-after study in Madagascar found that poaching of diademed sifakas and black and white ruffed lemurs appeared to have ceased after the distribution of conservation books in local primary schools.\nOne before-and-after study in India found that numbers of hoolock gibbons increased by 66% over five years after the implementation of an education and awareness programme, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in four African countries found that the level of knowledge about primates of visitors to a sanctuary housing guenons, mangabeys, chimpanzees and bonobos increased after the implementation of an education programme.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere are different types of media that can be used to inform people and raise their awareness about threats to primates and their conservation. Environmental education campaigns frequently use film or print media, theatre plays, group discussions, or a combination of these. For example, Mujaasi et al. (2006) found that after an education programme that involved lectures, distributed working papers, cross word puzzles, discussions, debates, and a visit to the Limbe Wildlife Centre in Cameroon where a wide variety of primate orphans, including chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla were housed, was implemented, students were able to list at least three endangered primate species in Cameroon. They also learnt which human activities had negative impact on the environment and many agreed that keeping primates as pets was wrong. An education and outreach programme implemented by CERCOPAN, a non-profit, non-governmental sanctuary, resulted in increased knowledge of students about primates after participating in the programme. The data also showed that the number of students that thought that primates made good pets, decreased significantly after participating in the programme and students were able to give examples of why primates should remain in the wild (Akparawa 2006). The results of an evaluation study of an education programme implemented across 14 schools outside the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda (Kuhar et al. 2010) demonstrated both long-term consistency in the effectiveness of delivering conservation-related knowledge and long-term retention of that information. Another study from Uganda showed that the ‘Great Ape Education Project’ designed to educate children and rural communities about the threats to great apes through ape-focused conservation films and supporting educational materials (magazines, brochures, posters), resulted in children being able to identify with and frequently cheer on the main characters in the film and encouraging them to save the great apes in their communities (Slavin 2014).\n            The above studies were not included in the synopsis, because their measure of effectiveness of the intervention was too indirect (Mujaasi et al. 2006), the study was not available as a full-text document thus lacking detailed information on results (Akparawa 2006), or the intervention did not specifically address primate species (Kuhar et al. 2010).\n \nMujaasi I., Cartwright B. & Kemigisa M.
