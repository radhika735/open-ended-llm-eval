  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects of using education and/or awareness campaigns to improve behaviour towards reptiles and reduce threats. One study was in each of Costa Rica, India, the Philippines, Dominica, the USA, Saint Kitts and Colombia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (1 studies): One before-and-after study in the Philippines found that following a communication, education, and public awareness campaign, the population of Philippine crocodiles increased.\nReproductive success (1 study): One study in Costa Rica found that during a community-based education programme the percentage of leatherback turtle nests lost to poaching decreased.\nSurvival (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies in the Philippines and Dominica found that following education and awareness campaigns, one in combination with use of road signs, human killing of Philippine crocodiles decreased and there were fewer road-deaths of lesser Antillean iguanas compared to before the campaigns began. One study in India reported that following education and awareness campaigns in combination with creating a network of local snake experts, local snake experts reported that they intervened to save 276 non-venomous snakes from being killed over six years.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (5 STUDIES)\n\nHuman behaviour change (3 studies): One replicated study in Colombia found that in areas with conservation initiatives relating to turtles, more people reported changing consumption habitats and fewer people reported using turtles for food compared to in areas with no initiatives, however, stated rates of hunting, buying and selling of turtles remained similar. One study in Saint Kitts found that attending an educational summer camp on turtle conservation had mixed effects on reported behaviours in relation to sea turtles of attendees and their parents/guardians, and mixed effects on whether they took part in conservation activities after the camp. One study in the USA found that providing an information leaflet did not decrease the number of hotel rooms that left lights on at night compared to when no leaflet was provided.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEducation programmes or awareness raising campaigns may be devised to address some of the threats posed to reptiles by humans. Such programmes may be aimed at a wide range of audiences, such as tourists, local residents, farmers or other businesses, and may tackle a wide range of threats, from exploitation through hunting, to the trade in exotic pets. In some cases, reptiles are protected by regulations and laws, but these may be difficult to enforce. Some infringements may be difficult to detect, whilst in other cases, people may be unaware of their responsibilities under such rules. Campaigns may be designed to increase compliance with laws, to encourage reporting of infringements (e.g. illegal hunting) or to reduce behaviours that can be a threat to reptiles (e.g. consumption of products derived from wild reptiles). Interventions may be carried out at a range of scales, from specific groups, largely through one-to-one interactions and targeted education programmes, through to large scale campaigns that spread awareness through broadcast and social media, signs and leaflets.\nThe effects of programmes may be measured in terms of the response of target species or in terms of changes in human behaviour that directly impact the magnitude of the threat."
