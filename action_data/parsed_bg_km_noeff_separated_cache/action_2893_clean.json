  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial and recreational vessels can generate large amounts of garbage and solid waste (Butt 2007). Wastes discharged overboard can pollute marine and freshwater environments through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, solid particles, and litter. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area may reduce or stop the source of pollution, and therefore reduce associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. However, solid waste can accumulate and persist in aquatic environments for a long time due to slow degradation (Pham et al. 2014, Andrady 2015), therefore this intervention alone may not be sufficient.\nFor an intervention related to the discharge of waste effluents, see Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels.\nAndrady A.L. (2015) Persistence of plastic litter in the oceans. Pages 57-72 in: Bergmann M., Gutow L. & Klages M. (eds.) Marine Anthropogenic Litter. Springer International Publishing, Cham.\nButt N.
