  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restricting the use of certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals. Three studies were in the UK, and one was in each of Germany and Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Italy found that arable field margins and rice field banks which were not sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate had a greater species richness of butterflies than margins and banks sprayed once/year for 1–3 years. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grass strips which were not sprayed with the herbicide fluazifop-P-butyl had a similar species richness of butterflies to strips sprayed once.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies (including two randomized studies) in the UK and Italy found that arable field margins and rice field banks which were not sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate had a higher total abundance of butterflies, and of meadow brown and large copper specifically, than margins and banks sprayed once/year for 1–3 years. One controlled study in Germany found that white campion plants sprayed with water had a higher abundance of lychnis moth eggs and caterpillars after one night than plants sprayed with the insecticide Karate Zeon. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that grass strips which were not sprayed with the herbicide fluazifop-P-butyl had a similar abundance of butterflies to strips sprayed once.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn conventional farming, a wide range of chemicals are commonly applied for pest control. Specific pesticides (including insecticides, herbicides or fungicides) vary in their ability to specifically target certain species, and the extent of their wider, detrimental effects on other species, including butterflies and moths (Russell & Schultz 2010, Schultz et al. 2016). Therefore, restricting the use of specific, more toxic, chemicals, may benefit species living on farmland.\nThis action includes studies where the use of a specific, named chemical has been reduced or stopped. For studies on a general reduction of multiple or unnamed chemicals, either without cessation or across a small area, see “Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally”. For studies on the complete cessation of chemical applications across an entire farm, see “Convert to organic farming”.\nRussell C. & Schultz C.B.
