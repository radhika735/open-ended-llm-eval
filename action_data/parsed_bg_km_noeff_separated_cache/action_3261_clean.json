  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing fragments of emergent, non-woody plants to brackish/saline wetlands. Two studies were in one bog in Canada. One study was in China.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that plots planted with rhizomes or sown with fragments of salt marsh herbs had similar overall vegetation biomass, after one year, to plots that had not been planted or sown.\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that plots sown with fragments of salt marsh herbs had greater overall cover of the introduced species, after one year, to unsown plots. However, biomass of the introduced species did not significantly differ between sown and unsown plots.\nIndividual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one also before-and-after) in brackish/saline wetlands in Canada and China simply quantified the abundance of herb species, over one year or growing season after planting herb fragments.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated study on a tidal flat in China reported that at least 25% of bulrush Scirpus mariqueter corms (bulb-like organs) produced shoots within the first growing season after planting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves introducing fragments of non-woody emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. This includes unrooted cuttings, roots, tubers/bulbs/corms (underground storage organs), rhizomes (underground horizontal stems) or stolons/runners (above-ground horizontal stems). Vegetation fragments may be planted directly into the soil, or spread on the soil surface. Fragments may be obtained from plants raised in greenhouses/laboratories, or collected from natural sites (with potential damage to donor site; Laegdsgaard 2002).\nIntroduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. However, note that up-front costs can be high.\nThe effects of planting may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were fragments introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the environmental conditions over the duration of the study?\nThe scope of this action does not include planting nurse plants; planting submerged or floating plants; planting to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); or planting facultative wetland plants in upland sites. In contrast, the scope does include planting non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).\nRelated actions: Directly plant whole plants; Introduce seeds or propagules; Transplant or replace blocks of vegetation; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including planting.\nBrown S.C. & Bedford B.L.
