  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of placing orphaned or abandoned wild young with wild foster parents. One study was in the USA, one was in South Africa and one was in Botswana.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (3 studies): Two studies (one controlled) in the USA and Botswana, found that orphaned young black bears and African wild dogs had greater or equal survival compared to animals released alone or young of wild mammals with their biological parents. A study in South Africa found that an orphaned cheetah cub was not accepted by a family of cheetahs.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nYoung mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. An alternative to captive rearing may be to attempt to foster young into existing wild families. If this can be achieved, it may improve their ability to find food in the wild and reduce the extent to which they become imprinted on humans and could, thus, improve the prospects of longer-term survival in the wild. However, the success of such programmes can be difficult to judge, without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.\nSee also Place orphaned or abandoned wild young with captive foster parents."
