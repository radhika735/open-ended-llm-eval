  "action_title": "Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants: freshwater swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using covers or barriers to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCovers such as plastic sheeting, fabric sheeting, wood chips or straw mulch could be used to control problematic plants. These may act as direct physical barriers, temporarily covering the ground or water surface to prevent seeds from settling and establishing. Barriers could also be used to modify environmental conditions to the detriment of problematic species. Shading or opaque screens can limit photosynthesis. In areas where the sun is strong, black plastic placed on the soil/sediment surface can increase temperatures to kill problematic plants and their seeds (a technique known as solarization; Katan & DeVay 1991). Covers can be anchored underwater, if necessary.\nCaution: Covers will also affect, and may kill, desirable plant species. Temporary application, when a site is most vulnerable to invasion by problematic plants, could solve this problem. Covers may need to be punctured to allow gas to escape.\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Add surface mulch or Add cover other than mulch, primarily to benefit desirable plants rather than harm problematic plants; Add surface mulch to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting.\nKatan J. & DeVay J.E.
