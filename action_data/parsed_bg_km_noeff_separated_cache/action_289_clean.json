  "action_title": "Set longlines at the side of the boat to reduce seabird bycatch",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects on seabird bycatch rates of setting longlines from the side of the boat.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSetting longlines off the side of the boat allows baits to sink before they reach the stern, where most of the birds following boats will be flying. However, it may require refitting boats, which is potentially expensive."
