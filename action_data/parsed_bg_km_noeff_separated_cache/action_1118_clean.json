  "action_title": "Asian clams: Add chemicals to the water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated laboratory study in the USA found that dosing with the biocides chlorine, potassium and copper killed Asian clams. \nA controlled, replicated laboratory study and a controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine, delivered at higher temperatures, shortened the time required to kill the Asian clams. \nA controlled field-based trial in Spanish irrigation systems showed that fat-coated particles called BioBullets could kill 100% of the Asian clams within pipes.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany chemicals will be effective at killing Asian clams Corbicula spp., but the wider impacts on non-target organisms must also be taken into account. Control agents that do not persist or accumulate in the wider environment are preferable, as are agents that might offer some specificity to bivalve molluscs. Combinations of control agents can offer particular benefits if they enhance one another’s toxicity effect upon the clams."
