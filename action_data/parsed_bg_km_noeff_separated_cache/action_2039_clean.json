  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred bats on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe aim of captive breeding is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. For studies that released hand-reared bats into the wild, see ‘Rehabilitate injured/orphaned bats to maintain wild bat populations’."
