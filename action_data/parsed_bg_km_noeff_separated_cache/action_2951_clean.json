  "action_title": "Regulate farming to allow gradual regeneration of marshes or swamps",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh/swamp vegetation, of regulating farming to allow gradual habitat regeneration.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe Tanzanian Forest Service provides renewable, one-year licenses that allow rice farming to continue if the farmers allow mangrove trees to grow. The intention is that several years later, the farmland is abandoned because the trees cast too much shade for the rice, and full regeneration of the mangrove habitat can occur (Evans 2017). This principle could be applied to other habitats. However, such a scheme creates a perverse incentive for farmers to prevent recovery of the target vegetation to avoid being forced off their land (Evans 2017). Even if farmers do abandon their original plot following habitat regeneration, it is possible they will clear vegetation elsewhere to begin farming again.\nRelated actions: Abandon cropland (freshwater – brackish/saline);     Abandon plantations; Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed sites (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps.\nEvans M.
