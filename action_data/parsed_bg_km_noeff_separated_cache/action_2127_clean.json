  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of using a smaller beam trawl on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the North Sea (Germany and Netherlands).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the North Sea found that a smaller beam trawl caused similar mortality of invertebrates in the trawl tracks compared to a larger beam trawl.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. A beam trawl is a type of trawl where the mouth of the net is held open by a wooden or metal beam, which can be up to 14 m long. Beam trawls can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through direct physical damage, bycatch, and alterations to the seabed (Bergman & Van Santbrink 2000). A smaller beam could be used, which may potentially limit impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates through reduced damage to the seabed. Evidence related to the use of other fishing gear instead of a beam trawl is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Use a pulse trawl instead of a beam trawl” and “Use an otter trawl instead of a beam trawl”.\n \nBergman M.J.N. & Van Santbrink J.W.
