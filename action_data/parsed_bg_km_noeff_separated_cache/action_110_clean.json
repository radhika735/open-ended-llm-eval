  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe have captured no evidence for the effects of removing coarse fish on farmland wildlife.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves removing coarse fish from waterbodies on farmland. Coarse fish include species such as common carp Cyprinus carpio which are typically stocked at high levels for recreational fishing. These species may have a negative impact on aquatic wildlife through competition for resources, predation and damage to habitats. Removal of coarse fish may benefit wildlife including waterbirds by reducing competition (Phillips 1992).\nPhillips V. E. (1992) Variation in winter wildfowl numbers on gravel pit lakes at Great Linford, Buckinghamshire, 1974-79 and 1984-91, with particular reference to the effects of fish removal.
