  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled, before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that the population size of mountain gorillas that were continuously monitored by vets, alongside other interventions, increased by 168% over 41 years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves the continuous health monitoring of primates by vets who are permanently based on site. There are only few organizations that provide in situ veterinary treatment for wild animals (e.g. Robbins et al. 2011). The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Program, for example, intervenes in cases of human-induced illnesses, such as injuries incurred by snares or respiratory disease, as well as when the life of an individual is at risk and there is the chance that the illness can spread to other individuals.\n \nRobbins M.M., Gray M., Fawcett K.A., Nutter F.B., Uwingeli P., Mburanumwe I., Kagoda E., Basabose A., Stoinski T.S., Cranfield M.R., Byamukama J., Spelman L.H., Robbins A.M. (2011) Extreme conservation leads to recovery of the Virunga mountain gorillas. PLoS ONE, 6, e19788."
