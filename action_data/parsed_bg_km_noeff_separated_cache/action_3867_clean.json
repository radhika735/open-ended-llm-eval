  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging. Two studies were in Brazil and one was in each of Sweden and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at different intensities had a different community composition of fruit-feeding butterflies to pristine forest.\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that forests harvested by single tree selection had a similar species richness of moths to forests managed by group selection harvesting or clearcutting, but a lower species richness than unharvested forest. One site comparison study in Brazil found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a similar species richness and diversity of butterflies to primary forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at different intensities had a similar species richness of fruit-feeding butterflies.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Sweden found that selectively logged forests had a higher abundance of exposed moth caterpillars, but a similar abundance of concealed moth caterpillars, to clearcut forests, and a similar abundance of all moth caterpillars to undisturbed forests. One site comparison study in Brazil found that a forest managed by reduced impact logging had a higher abundance of butterflies than primary forest. One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that forests managed by reduced impact logging at intermediate intensity had a higher abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies than forests managed by high or low intensity reduced impact logging.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHarvesting timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height, or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to conventional clearcutting where all trees are felled. Reduced impact logging is a sustainable harvesting and management method that aims to minimize ecological disturbance. It involves selective logging as well as other practices such as mapping large target trees prior to felling, limiting the number of trees which can be felled/hectare, pre-cutting heavy vines and controlling the direction in which trees fall to minimize collateral damage, and planning the routes of access roads to reduce disturbance (Montejo-Kovacevich et al. 2018, Ribeiro & Freitas 2012). The aim is to preserve the integrity of the forest structure, which may also be termed “continuous cover forestry” if the canopy remains intact.\nFor other options for harvesting timber, see “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.\nMontejo-Kovacevich G., Hethcoat M.G., Lim F.K.S., Marsh C.J., Bonfantti D., Peres C.A. & Edwards D.P.
