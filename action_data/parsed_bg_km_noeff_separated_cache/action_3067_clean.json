  "action_title": "Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing: brackish/salt marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the frequency of cutting/mowing in brackish/salt marshes (or cutting/mowing them at different frequencies).\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the effects of different cutting/mowing frequencies, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve the target vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared cutting/mowing at different frequencies (e.g. 1 vs 2 cuts/year) but with the same intensity and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). For this action, “reduction” includes stopping disturbance altogether. However, studies comparing areas that remain uncut to areas that become cut, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.\nConnell, J.H.
