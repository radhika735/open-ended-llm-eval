  "action_title": "Use voluntary agreements with locals to reduce disturbance",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of using voluntary agreements with locals to reduce disturbance.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHuman access can be a major cause of disturbance to wild mammals. In some cases, disturbance can be reduced by restricting access using regulations or laws. In other instances, local communities may have long-standing access rights or traditions and voluntary agreements drawn up in consultation with such stakeholders may be attempted.\nSee also: Agriculture and aquaculture - Relocate local pastoralist communities to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
