  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using prescribed burning in wetlands on reptile populations. One study was in each of the USA and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two controlled studies (including one replicated, randomized study) in the USA and Australia found mixed effects of using prescribed burning in wetlands on the abundance of western yellow-bellied racer snakes. The other study found that found that burned areas had a similar abundance of reptiles and amphibians compared to unburned areas, but that delicate skinks were less abundant in burned areas.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone, and others have been shaped by long-term use of prescribed burning (Bowman 1998). Prescribed burns are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging, ‘wildfires’. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires that have been suppressed through management or with the expressed purpose of enhancing wildlife habitat (Russell et al. 1999). Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, the intensity of the fire may influence the response of reptiles to the prescribed burn–low-intensity fires may reduce shelters and prey availability while high-intensity fires may increase prey food items but reduce over wintering sites (Pearson et al. 2005). The impact of prescribed burning on habitats and their associated reptile populations are likely to vary depending on whether the vegetation is dominated by woody species, or by grasses and other herbaceous plants. As such, the impact of prescribed burning on reptile populations may vary in different habitats.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type. See here for: Forest, open woodland & savanna or Grassland & shrubland.\nFor studies that assess the affect of burning in combination with other actions see Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing.\nBowman D.M.J.S.
