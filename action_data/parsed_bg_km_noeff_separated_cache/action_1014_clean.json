  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of different sewage treatments on the activity of foraging bats. The study was in the UK. We found no studies that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments of domestic and urban waste water discharged into rivers on bat populations.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found higher activity (relative abundance) of foraging bats over filter bed sewage treatment works than over active sludge systems.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic pollution occurs when treated sewage effluents containing organic compounds are discharged into rivers affecting plant growth and the number and diversity of insects. Riparian habitats are important for foraging bats and changes in water quality may have positive effects on foraging activity for some species, and negative effects for others (Vaughan et al. 1996, Kalcounis-Rüppell et al. 2007, Abbott et al. 2009).\nWe found evidence that filter sewage bed treatment works can provide foraging habitat for bats. However, the results should be treated with caution as a subsequent study found that insects above these filter beds were contaminated with endocrine disrupting chemicals that may have adverse effects on bats feeding on them (Park et al. 2009).\nAbbott I.M., Sleeman D.P. & Harrison S.
