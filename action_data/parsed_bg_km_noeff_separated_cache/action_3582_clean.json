  "action_title": "Use catch and hook protection devices",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using catch and hook protection devices on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCatch and hook protection devices may be used to cover caught fish and hooks during hauling to reduce the chance of entanglement with aquatic reptiles. This may include ‘net sleeves’ which cover caught fish and hooks with the downward pressure of hauling, or triggered devices (e.g. chains, cages, cones etc.) that automatically release when a fish is hooked. This may prevent reptile injury or death due to hooking."
