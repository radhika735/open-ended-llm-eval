  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring waterways on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA found that restored and pristine streams had similar turtle community composition.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One site comparison study in the USA found that restored and pristine streams had a similar abundance of turtles. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that creating new waterways by redirecting flows during forest restoration had mixed effects of reptile abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStreams may be drained or redirected during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Many waterways have been cleared of submerged wood (‘desnagging’) for recreational purposes (e.g. fishing) or to allow boat access or protect against perceived flooding risks.\nRiver restoration projects often include returning large woody material into streams and rivers (‘resnagging’), to slow down river flow, provide shelter for native fishes and increase basking areas for reptiles, especially freshwater turtles (Bodie 2001). Other restoration activities may include planting new or managing existing vegetation to provide appropriate shading levels for reptiles, and redirecting water flows.\nFor studies discussing wetlands and pond creation and restoration, see Create or restore wetlands and Create or restore ponds.\nBodie J.R. (2001) Stream and riparian management for freshwater turtles. Journal of Environmental Management, 62,443–444."
