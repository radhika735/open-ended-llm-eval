  "action_title": "Isolate colonies of beneficial ants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nNatural enemies: One replicated, controlled study from Australia found predatory ants occupied more cashew trees when colonies were kept isolated. Pest damage and yield: The same study found lower pest damage to cashews and higher yields.\nThe crop studied was cashew.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves pruning perennial crop trees to isolate ant colonies living in the tree canopy. Where ants act as natural predators, this action may improve pest control by reducing the time, energy and ant population losses incurred when rival ant colonies interact and viciously fight each other. This differs from the action 'Exclude ants that protect pests' for managing ants that limit rather than benefit natural pest control (for inclusion in a future synopsis)."
