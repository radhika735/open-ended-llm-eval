  "action_id": "3144",
  "action_title": "Slow down input water to allow more time for pollutants to be removed",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh or swamp vegetation, of slowing down input water to allow more time for pollutants to be removed.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPolluted water entering a marsh or swamp could be slowed down, allowing more time for natural breakdown or removal of pollutants. This intervention includes various ways of slowing down input water by altering the structure of input channels, such as making them longer or damming them.\n \nRelated actions: Clean waste water before it enters the environment;     Divert/block/stop polluted water inputs;     Retain/restore/create vegetation around focal sites, including in waterways (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps)."
