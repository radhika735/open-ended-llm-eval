  "action_title": "Use visual or acoustic deterrents to discourage reptiles from approaching vessels",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using visual or acoustic deterrents to discourage reptiles from approaching vessels.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAcoustic and visual deterrents have been developed to cause sea turtles to flee from vessels (e.g. Lenhardt 2002) but little is known about their efficacy in practice. However, practitioners need to consider the potential for acoustic trauma resulting from sound transmissions, the habituation of target species to sounds and the potential to disturb and displace other non-target marine fauna (Schoeman et al. 2020).\nFor studies describing the effects of using visual deterrents or adding lights to fishing gear, see Threat: Biological resource use – Use visual deterrents on fishing gear and Add lights to fishing gear.\nLenhardt M.L. (2002) Marine Turtle Acoustic Repellent/Alerting Apparatus and Method. US Patent No 6,388,949 B1. Arlington, VA: Sound Technique Systems.\nSchoeman R.P., Patterson-Abrolat C., & Plön S.
