  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining buffer zones around core habitat.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProtected areas are usually subject to the influence of activities in surrounding areas. Buffer zones around core habitat in protected areas are usually areas of land which do not receive full protection and are not subject to the same management intensity of core areas, but on which there may be some degree of limit to activities such as hunting, agriculture and development. In some cases, buffer zones themselves can provide additional habitat for mammals (Paolino et al. 2016) though this can also expose them to a higher level of human-related threats (van der Meer et al. 2013).\nvan der Meer E., Fritz H., Blinston P. & Rasmussen G.S.A. (2013) Ecological trap in the buffer zone of a protected area: effects of indirect anthropogenic mortality on the African wild dog Lycaon pictus. Oryx, 48, 285–293.\nPaolino R.M., Versiani N.F., Pasqualotto N., Rodrigues T.F., Krepschi V.G. & Chiarello A.G. (2016) Buffer zone use by mammals in a Cerrado protected area.
