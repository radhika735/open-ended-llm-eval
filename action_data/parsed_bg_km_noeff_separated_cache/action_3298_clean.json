  "action_title": "Add upland topsoil before/after planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding upland topsoil to freshwater wetlands planted with trees/shrubs.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTopsoil can be a source of soil organic matter and help to improve water retention (Bruland & Richardson 2004). This might benefit wetland vegetation, particularly when creating new swamps. Topsoil may often be added to complement planting (current intervention) rather than without planting: upland soil will probably not contain seeds or fragments of swamp plants. Caution: Topsoil may contain seeds or fragments of undesirable vegetation.\nRelated actions: Add upland topsoil, other than to complement planting; Transplant wetland soil before/after planting.\nBruland G.L. & Richardson C.J. (2004) Hydrologic gradients and topsoil additions affect soil properties of Virginia created wetlands. Soil Science Society of America Journal, 68, 2069–2077."
