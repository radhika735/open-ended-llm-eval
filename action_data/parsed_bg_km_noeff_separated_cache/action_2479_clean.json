  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using ultrasonic noises to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, controlled, paired sites study in Australia found that ultrasonic devices did not repel eastern gray kangaroos.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUltrasonic noise is sound waves at higher frequencies than those audible to humans. Different mammal species can detect sound at different ranges of frequencies, so some ultrasonic noises may be audible to a range of mammal species. If ultrasonic noises can deter animals from damaging crops, this could reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of such species.\nSee also: Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict, Use noise aversive conditioning to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflictÂ and Use loud noises to deter crop damage (e.g. banger sticks, drums, tins, iron sheets) by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
