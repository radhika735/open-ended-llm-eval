  "action_title": "Control non-native/problematic plants to restore habitat",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of controlling invasive or problematic plants to restore habitat.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasive plant species can drive large scale changes to habitats. These changes can make habitats less suitable for use by mammal species. Control of invasive or problematic plants might be undertaken to recreate suitable conditions for fauna, including target mammals (e.g. Dumalisile Somers 2017).\nDumalisile L. & Somers M.J. (2017) The effects of an invasive alien plant (Chromolaena odorata) on large African mammals. Nature Conservation Research, 2, 102â€“108."
