  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDrill cuttings from oil and gas drilling activities are often discharged onto the sea floor or river bed to form a cuttings pile. Drill cuttings consist of fragments of rock contaminated with drilling fluids, oil, and chemicals, which may have adverse impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. Ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers may reduce pollution and potential harm to marine and freshwater mammals."
