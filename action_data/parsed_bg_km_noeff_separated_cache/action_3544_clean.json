  "action_title": "Cease or prohibit commercial fishing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of ceasing or prohibiting commercial fishing.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial fishing is extraction of marine organisms by any method for sale and profit and poses a threat to reptiles through accidental entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’). Ceasing or prohibiting commercial fishing in specific areas may allow time for populations of reptiles and the species they rely on (e.g. prey species) to recover.\nFor other studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting fishing see Cease or prohibit all types of fishing and Limit or prohibit specific fishing methods.  For studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting fishing at certain times see Establish temporary fishery closures."
