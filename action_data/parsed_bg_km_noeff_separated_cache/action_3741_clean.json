  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating and releasing injured or accidentally caught tortoises, terrapins, side-necked and softshell turtles on their populations. Two studies were in France and one was in each of South Africa and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One controlled study in France found that some rehabilitated Hermann’s tortoises were observed mating with resident tortoises following release.\nSurvival (4 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that survival of rehabilitated and released Hermann’s tortoises was similar compared to wild tortoises over a two-year period. Three studies (including two replicated studies) in South Africa, France and the USA found that Babcock’s leopard tortoises, Herman’s tortoises and ornate box turtles released following rehabilitation survived for varying durations during monitoring periods that ranged from three months to 25 months or until the end of the active season during the year of release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One controlled study in France found that 12 rehabilitated Herman’s tortoises remained within 2 km of their release site over a three-month period. This study also found that daily movement of rehabilitated and released tortoises was similar to residents. One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that rehabilitated tortoises released in autumn took longer to establish a home range than those released in spring.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReptiles that are injured, sick or found in a weak condition are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be treated and released back into the wild. Animals may be injured or weakened due to direct interactions with human threats, for example entanglement in fishing gear, or due to natural threats such as extremes of weather caused by climate change (for example sea turtles may become ‘cold-shocked’ due to sudden severe cold weather). Often rehabilitation is carried out more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation. However, for rare species it may be essential to preserve populations and release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared reptiles. It is also important to note that some of the studies summarized below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are less likely to have been reported.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians or Tuatara.\nFor studies evaluating the effect of releasing reptiles that were accidentally caught in fishing gear, see Threat: Biological resource use – Establish handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled (‘bycatch’) reptiles and Release accidentally caught (‘bycatch’) reptiles."
