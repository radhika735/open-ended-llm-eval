  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of establishing long-term cover on erodible cropland. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA, found that establishing long-term cover on erodible cropland did not increase the abundance of eastern cottontails.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEstablishing long-term cover on cropland that is highly susceptible to erosion may be carried out for a number of reasons including conserving soil fertility, limiting carbon emissions and enhancing habitat for biodiversity. The provision of long-term cover has potential to benefit mammals that are able to exploit increased shelter and food resources."
