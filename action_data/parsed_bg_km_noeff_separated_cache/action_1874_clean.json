  "action_title": "Amphibians: Provide natural substrate for species which do not breed in water (e.g. burrowing/tunnel breeders)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated studies in Australia and Fiji found that adding a variety of substrates to an enclosure, as well as rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes in one case, promoted egg laying in frogs. The Australian study also temporarily flooded enclosures, manipulated sex ratios and played recorded mating calls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBreeding may be stimulated by promoting natural breeding behaviours, such as digging or nest building. By providing natural substrate, which may be present in the amphibian’s wild environment, natural digging and building behaviour may be triggered, leading to breeding."
