  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of lobbying/campaigning/demonstrating to protect marshes or swamps. The study was in Brazil.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nHuman behaviour (1 study): One study in Brazil reported after lobbying local and national governments, a wetland complex was designated as a sustainable development reserve (rather than being strictly protected) and a sustainable development research institute was created.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLobbying or peaceful demonstrations could put pressure on projects that threaten marshes or swamps, preventing them from occurring or minimizing their impact. Specific actions include demonstrating on site, writing letters and social media campaigns.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must involve campaigns targeted at organizations such as businesses or governments. Studies must provide some detail about what the lobbying, campaigning or demonstrating involved in practice. For example, Wetlands International (2014) report that their “advocacy influence” has led to the alteration or abandonment of several projects that could have impacted marshes or swamps (e.g. delay and redesign of the Fomi Dam, Upper Niger River, and consideration of marsh ecosystems in Shell’s oil and gas operations in Iraq). We have not summarized these examples as evidence because there is little detail about the methods used in their advocacy.\nTo be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the lobbying is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).\nRelated actions: Raise public awareness about marshes or swamps.\nWetlands International (2014) Our Achievements 2011–2013.
