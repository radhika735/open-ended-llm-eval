  "action_title": "Install speed bumps to reduce vehicle collisions with primates",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of installing speed bumps to reduce vehicle collisions with primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpeed limits in areas with high traffic and high primate densities may help to avoid vehicle collisions with primates and reduce stress levels in primates. Furthermore, primates may be able to cross roads more easily in areas where speed limits are enforced compared to areas with no traffic regulations. While the enforcement of speed limits by traffic police may not be feasible in protected areas, the implementation of speed bumps may effectively reduce vehicle speed in these areas. For example, speed bumps were found to be effective at reducing vehicle speeds on Ghanaian roads (Afukaar 2003). \n            Implementing and enforcing speed limits is discussed under ‘Implement speed limits in particular areas (e.g. with high primate densities) to reduce vehicle collisions with primates’ and imposing fines for breaking the speed limit or for colliding with primates is discussed under ‘Impose fines for breaking the speed limit or colliding with primates’.\n \nAfukaar F.K.
