  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on native mammals of removing or controlling non-native mammals within a fenced area. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A site comparison study in Australia found that in a fenced area where invasive cats, red foxes and European rabbits were removed, native mammal species richness was higher than outside the fenced area.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A site comparison study in Australia found that in a fenced area where invasive cats, red foxes and European rabbits were removed, native mammals overall and two out of four small mammal species were more abundant than outside the fenced area.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nControl of non-native mammals may be carried out to reverse detrimental impacts of such species on native plants and animals. Total elimination of non-native mammals may be difficult or impossible to carry out on a large scale, with control programmes often being confined to small islands, where elimination may be achievable. However, away from islands, a similar benefit might be realised if non-native mammals can be removed from within an area that is fenced to prevent their recolonization."
