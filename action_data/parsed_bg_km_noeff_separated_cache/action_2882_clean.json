  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing riparian buffers to reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAgricultural and forestry effluents, which may contain chemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients, solid particles, and sediment, can enter rivers and other watercourses, and be discharged into the sea. Riparian buffers (uncultivated strips of vegetation along waterways) may be created to help reduce diffuse pollution from agriculture and forestry. For example, trees and plants within riparian buffers may trap sediments and solid particles and uptake excess nutrients (Collins et al. 2009). Establishing riparian buffers in agricultural and forestry areas may reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.\nCollins A.L., Hughes G., Zhang Y. & Whitehead J. (2009) Mitigating diffuse water pollution from agriculture: riparian buffer strip performance with width. CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, 4, 1–15."
