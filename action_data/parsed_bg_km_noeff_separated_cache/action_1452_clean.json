  "action_title": "Establish no-mining zones in/near watersheds so as to preserve water levels and water quality",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of establishing no-mining zones in/near watersheds so as to preserve water levels and water quality on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWatersheds in mining zones affected by active and/or abandoned hard rock mining may act as sources of metals contamination and acid mine drainage. This is because in order to cluster the mineral extractions, chemicals such as cyanide and mercury are used and are often discharged, intentionally or not, into nearby rivers and streams (A.P.E.S. undated). Establishing no mining zones in/near watersheds may help to prevent water pollution and thus help maintain primate populations.\nÂ \nA.P.E.S. Portal (Undated) Threats: Mineral Resource Extraction.
