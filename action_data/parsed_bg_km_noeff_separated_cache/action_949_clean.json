  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of creating alternative bat roosts within developments on bat populations. Nine studies were in Europe and two were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (11 STUDIES)     \n\nUse: (11 studies): Two replicated studies in the USA and UK found that bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or a purpose-built bat wall after exclusion from buildings. Three studies (two replicated) in the USA and UK and one review in the UK found that bat boxes or bat lofts/barns were used by bats at 13–74% of development sites, and bat lofts/barns were used by maternity colonies at one of 19 development sites. Three of five before-and-after studies in Portugal, Ireland, Spain and the UK found that bat colonies used purpose-built roosts in higher or similar numbers after the original roosts were destroyed. The other two studies found that bats used purpose-built roosts in lower numbers than the original roost. One review in the UK found that new bat boxes/lofts built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts retained during development.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNew alternative bat roosts are often created within developments to replace original roosts that have been destroyed. This can include purpose-built bat barns, lofts or houses, bat boxes, or features created within existing buildings such as specially designed crevices and bat bricks.\nFor an intervention that involves retaining existing bat roosts within developments, see ‘Retain existing bat roosts and access points within developments’. For a general intervention relating to bat boxes, see 'Provide bat boxes for roosting bats'."
