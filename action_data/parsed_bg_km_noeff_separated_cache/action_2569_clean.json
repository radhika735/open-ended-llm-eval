  "action_title": "Restore or create shrubland",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating shrubland. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Mexico.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies, in the USA and Mexico, found that following desert scrub or shrubland restoration, mammal species richness was similar to that in undisturbed areas.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that restored desert scrub hosted similar small mammal abundance compared to undisturbed desert scrub.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that restoring shrubland following tree clearance did not increase usage of areas by mule deer compared to tree clearance alone.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLoss of shrubland may be due to a range of factors, including too many grazing animals inhibiting regeneration of shrubs, too few grazing animals or fire suppression leading to reversion to woodland, or invasion by non-native species. Shrubland restoration or creation may benefit mammals associated with the habitat."
