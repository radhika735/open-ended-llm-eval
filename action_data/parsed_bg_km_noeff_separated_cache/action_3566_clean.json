  "action_title": "Prevent the loss and discard of fishing gear and related debris",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of preventing the loss and discard of fishing gear and related debris.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAbandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016).\nPotential options for reducing the amount of discarded fishing gear include: offering incentives for recovering, reusing or recycling gear; equipping ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities; improving methods for locating abandoned gear; establishing fishing gear registration programmes to encourage responsible use of gear; and informing fishers of the impacts of derelict fishing gear on reptiles to encourage its responsible disposal.\nFor studies on the recovery of fishing gear that has already been discarded see Recover lost or discarded fishing gear."
