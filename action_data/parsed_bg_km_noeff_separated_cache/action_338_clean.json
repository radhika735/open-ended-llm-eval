  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf six studies, two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found higher densities of birds or nests on mown grasslands, compared to unmanaged or burned areas. Two controlled studies from the USA, one replicated, found lower nesting or population densities of some species, on mown grasslands compared to unmown areas. Two replicated and controlled studies found no significant differences in nesting densities or community composition between mown and unmown areas.\nOne study from the USA found that grasshopper sparrow nesting success was higher on mown areas than grazed areas of grassland. A replicated controlled study from the USA found that ducks had similar nesting success on cut and uncut areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCutting and mowing of grasslands can help maintain grass cover, as grasses can survive cutting, whilst herbs and woody plants may not. Cutting can also encourage grass re-growth and increase productivity. Alternatively, in improved soils, cutting and removing the cut vegetation can reduce the nutrient content of the grassland and allow species that rely on nutrient poor soils to return."
