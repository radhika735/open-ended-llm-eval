  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of limiting vessel speeds on reptiles. One study was in each of Australia, Costa Rica and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that in waterways with enforced speed limits, fewer spectacled caiman were found dead with boat-related injuries compared to waterways with no speed limits. One replicated study in the USA found that vessels travelling at lower speeds caused fewer catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells, though vessels with jet motors caused no catastrophic injuries at any speed tested.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that in waterways with enforced speed limits, fewer spectacled caiman were found with boat-related injuries compared to waterways with no speed limits.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated study in Australia found that green turtles were more likely to flee from vessels travelling at lower speeds.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTurtle collisions with boats are of major concern due to the high rate of strike injury found in all species, both freshwater (Bennett & Litzgus 2014) and oceanic (Hazel et al. 2007, Denkinger et al. 2013). Establishing speed limits for watercraft in important areas has been found to benefit some aquatic animals by giving them more time to avoid collisions with approaching vessels (Nowacek et al. 2004, Laist & Shaw 2006) and may similarly benefit aquatic reptiles.\nBennett A.M. & Litzgus J.D.
