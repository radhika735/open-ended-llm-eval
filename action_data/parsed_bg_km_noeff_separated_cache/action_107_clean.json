  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA systematic review found seven studies demonstrating that trapping appears to be an effective method of reducing American mink populations, but firm conclusions could not be made due to limitations in experimental design.\nA large-scale trapping programme in the UK demonstrated that American mink have been successfully eradicated over a large area and this may have been associated with some localized water vole expansions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThe UK water vole Arvicola amphibius population has declined by 96% since 1950, which is largely thought to be due to predation by invasive non-native American mink Mustela vison. Mink also prey on fish, birds and other mammals, and can have a significant effect on local wildlife (Defra 2005). This intervention may involve controlling mink populations through trapping.\nDefra (2005) Mink. Defra Rural Development Service. Rural Development Service Technical Advice Note 02."
