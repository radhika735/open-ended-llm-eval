  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining or planting trees to act as windbreaks. This study was in Sweden.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One site comparison study in Sweden reported that sheltered grassland strips were more likely to be used by one of four butterfly species than strips providing nectar resources or no resources.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEven under normal weather conditions many species of butterfly and moth, particularly those which are weak fliers, show a preference for sheltered areas (Hayes et al. 2018). However, during extreme weather events, high winds are a particular problem as they prevent adults from being able to fly, and therefore potentially find food, defend territories, or mate. Retaining or planting trees, which act as wind breaks, may enable butterflies and moths to maintain activity during higher winds, reducing the impact of extreme weather events resulting from climate change.\nHayes M.P., Rhodes M.W., Turner E.C., Hitchcock G.E., Knock R.I., Lucas C.B.H. & Chaney P.K. (2018) Determining the long-term habitat preferences of the Duke of Burgundy butterfly, Hamearis lucina, on a chalk grassland reserve in the UK. Journal of Insect Conservation, 22, 329–343."
