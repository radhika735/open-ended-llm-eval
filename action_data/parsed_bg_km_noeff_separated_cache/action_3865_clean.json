  "action_title": "Legally protect large native trees",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of legally protecting large native trees.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrees, in particular large, old individuals of native species, provide a range of important resources for butterflies and moths. Many species feed on trees as caterpillars, or nectar from them as adults, and trees also provide perches from which they can defend territories, or shelter where they can rest (Thomas & Lewington 2016). However, trees may take 100 years or more to reach large sizes, making them functionally irreplaceable components of the landscape. Therefore, when harvesting trees for commercial use, legally mandating the protection of large, native individuals may have a disproportionate impact on the conservation of butterflies and moths which rely on them.\nThomas J.A. & Lewington R. (2016) The Butterflies of Britain and Ireland. Bloomsbury, London, UK."
