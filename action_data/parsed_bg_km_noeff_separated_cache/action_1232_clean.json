  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in New Zealand1 found that rodent control decreased native plant species richness and did not affect total plant species richness.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany rodents feed on seeds. Others that feed on tree bark may cause tree death by girdling (damaging round tree trunks). Controlling rodent populations can minimize seed predation or girdling and thus increase the abundance or reduce death of some plant species."
