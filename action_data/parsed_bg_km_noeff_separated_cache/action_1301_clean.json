  "action_title": "<i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use grazing to control plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that excluding grazing reduced the abundance and coverage of Crassula helmsii. The other study found no difference in cover of C. helmsii between ungrazed and grazed plots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGrazing by livestock is often used as a conservation measure to increase plant species diversity in grassland. Depending on the dietary preferences of the animals, grazing could potentially increase or reduce the competitive advantage and coverage of C. helmsii on the margins of waterbodies or marshy areas. Increased grazing pressure was observed to be related to a decrease in C. helmsii cover at waterbodies in the New Forest, but several potentially confounding factors were present (Ewald 2014).\nEwald N.C. (2014) Crassula helmsii in the New Forest. Final report on the status, spread and impact of this non-native invasive plant, and the efficacy of control techniques following a 3 year trial.
