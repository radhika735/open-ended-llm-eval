  "action_title": "Cut or burn oil-contaminated vegetation: freshwater marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting or burning oil-contaminated vegetation in freshwater marshes.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOil spills can damage vegetation in marshes. Lighter oils can kill plants through their toxic effects, whilst heavier oils coat and smother vegetation (Michel & Rutherford 2013). Coastal sites are vulnerable to offshore tanker spillages. For example, an estimated 5.5 million tonnes of oil has been released into mangrove-lined coastal waters around the world since 1958, killing at least 126,000 ha of mangrove vegetation (Duke 2016). Oil pipelines crossing inland wetlands (e.g. the Russia-China Oil Pipeline; Yu et al. 2010) pose a threat from leaks and malfunctions. Loss of vegetation can increase the risk of erosion and permanent habitat loss (Beland et al. 2017; https://youtu.be/UkATPicHIo4).\nThis action involves cutting or burning above-ground plant parts from oil-contaminated marshes. This may increase oxygen supply to the root zone (oil smothering leaves may interfere with oxygen diffusion) and prevent complete death of the oiled plants (Zengel & Michel 1996).\nCaution: Activity on the wetland surface (e.g. foot traffic) could churn oil further into the sediment. Removing above-ground vegetation could increase rates of erosion.\nRelated actions: Use artificial barriers to block pollution; Physically or chemically remove oil; Stimulate microbial breakdown of oil.\nBeland M., Biggs T.W., Roberts D.A., Peterson S.H., Kokaly R.F. & Piazza S.
