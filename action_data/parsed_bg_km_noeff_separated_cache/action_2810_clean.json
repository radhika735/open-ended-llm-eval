  "action_title": "Involve fishers in designing and trialling new gear types to encourage uptake of more selective fishing gear",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of involving fishers in designing and trialling new gear types on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne of the core aims of any management plan to sustainably harvest the marine fish resource is to only remove specific sizes or species, thereby minimizing unwanted catch and mortality. This can partly be achieved by making fishing gear as selective as possible. Fishers have knowledge and information about the marine environment that may be invaluable in informing the design and potential uptake of new fishing gear. Fishers are unlikely to use new gear that is impractical to handle and deploy or that causes large losses of their commercial target catch. Involving fishers in the process may not only help encourage development of more selective fishing gears, but it may ensure more successful uptake if the potential solutions have fisher buy-in and approval (Eliasen et al. 2019; Feekings et al. 2019).\nEliasen S.Q., Feekings J., Krag L., Veiga–Malta T., Mortensen L.O. & Ulrich C.
