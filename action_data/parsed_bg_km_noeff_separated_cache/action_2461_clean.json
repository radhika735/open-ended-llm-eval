  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of using noise aversive conditioning to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in USA found that noise aversive conditioning reduced bait consumption by white-tailed deer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAversive conditioning is the process of associating a negative stimulus with a secondary behaviour or outcome. In the case of this intervention, it involves associating a negative stimuli with a neutral one (noise) when carrying out undesirable behaviour (feeding on crops) to the extent that the neutral stimuli alone deters this behaviour. If this reduces crop damage, it may reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of wild mammalian herbivores."
