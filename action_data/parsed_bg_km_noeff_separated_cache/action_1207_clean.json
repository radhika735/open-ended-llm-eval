  "action_title": "Reduce the intensity of livestock grazing in forests",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated study in the UK found that reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled study in Greece found that reducing grazing intensity increased understory biomass.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nComplete removal of livestock by fencing tends to promote regeneration, mainly in the early stages after removal. This is due to the removal of the disturbance effect of animals, which commonly provides ‘niches’ for seedling establishment. Reducing grazing intensity rather than complete removal may allow continued income from livestock."
