  "action_title": "Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHarvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Leave-tree harvest retains a low density of high-quality trees uniformly through the forest stand. Trees can be retained in groups or dispersed and may contain trees with structural characteristics important to wildlife. Compared to clearcutting, this type of management can help maintain forest species.\nFor other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”."
