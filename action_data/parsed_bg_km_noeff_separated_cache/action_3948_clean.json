  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or creating peatland. Two studies were in each of Finland and the UK, and one was in each of the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Finland found that mires restored by filling ditches and cutting trees had a moth community which was intermediate between drained and pristine mires.\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in Finland found that after mires were restored by raising the water table and removing large trees, they had a higher species richness of mire specialist butterflies than before restoration or than unrestored, drained mires, and a similar species richness to pristine mires. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Ireland reported that protected bogs re-wetted by blocking drains had a similar species richness of moths to unrestored and unprotected bogs.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (4 studies): Two before-and-after studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled study) in the UK and Finland found that bogs re-wetted by blocking drains and mires restored by raising the water table and removing large trees had a higher abundance of rosy marsh moth caterpillars and mire specialist butterflies than before restoration or than unrestored mires, and a similar abundance to pristine mires. Two replicated, paired, site comparison studies in Finland and Ireland found that mires restored by filling ditches and cutting trees and bogs restored by blocking drains (along with legal protection) had mixed effects on moth abundance compared to unrestored sites depending on species.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in the UK found that where water levels had risen due to peatland restoration, large heath butterfly caterpillars had lower winter survival than in areas where water levels had not risen.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that wet heathland where water levels had been recently raised were less frequently occupied by Alcon large blue than sites where the water level had not been raised.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge areas of peatland have been deliberately or unintentionally drained (for example extracting drinking water from below ground lowers the water table over a large area) for human activities. Drained peat can be too dry and chemically unsuitable for peatland plants (Lamers et al. 2002), reducing the suitability of habitat for specialist butterflies and moths. Peatland restoration typically involves raising the water table to rewet the surface peat. This creates more suitable conditions for recolonization by peatland plants (Money & Wheeler 1999; Ritzema et al. 2014), such as bog myrtle Myrica gale, which could benefit butterflies and moths which depend upon them as a caterpillar food source (Fowles et al. 2004). However, the rate at which water levels are raised may need to be controlled, so as not to submerge overwintering caterpillars (Joy & Pullin 1997, 1999). It may also be necessary to rewet the area around a peatland (creating a ‘hydrological buffer zone’) to prevent water simply draining away from the peatland.\nA range of techniques may be used to raise the water table to restore peatlands, for example blocking drainage ditches, planting flood-resistant vegetation to slow water flow, blocking underground channels, building raised embankments to retain water, inserting dams below the peat surface to slow subsurface drainage, switching off drainage pumps, felling trees, or restoring inflows. These interventions are all considered in this action. For studies of specific actions for creating, restoring, or managing peatlands, see “Replant native vegetation” and “Employ areas of semi-natural habitat for rough grazing (includes salt marsh, lowland heath, bog, fen)”.\nHabitats within this action include peatland, bogs, mires, and wet heathland, where the water table is close to the ground surface. For studies on restoring wet grasslands, fenland and floodplains, see “Restore or create wetlands and floodplains”. For studies on restoring dry heathland and shrubland, see “Restore or create heathland/shrubland”.\nFowles A.P., Bailey M.P. & Hale A.D.
