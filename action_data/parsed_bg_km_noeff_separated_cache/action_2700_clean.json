  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies examined the effects of using different bait on marine fish populations. Two studies were global systematic reviews. Three studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA, Iceland).Two studies were in the South Pacific Ocean (New Zealand). One study was in each of the Norwegian/Barents Seas (Norway), the Barents Sea (Norway), the Denmark Strait (Greenland) and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated study in the South Pacific Ocean and one global systematic review found that using different bait species did not reduce hooking injuries (associated with higher post-release mortality) of undersized snapper or sharks and rays, and did not increase survival of sharks and rays on gear retrieval.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (10 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (10 studies): Six of eight replicated studies (three controlled and one randomized) in the Norwegian/Barents Seas, Barents Sea, Denmark Strait, North Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the South Pacific Ocean, found that using a different bait type (including size, species and manufacture method) reduced the unwanted catches of undersized haddock (although in one case in only two of six comparisons), Atlantic cod and other unwanted or non-target fish catch, but unwanted catches of torsk and ling were similar, compared to standard or other bait types. Two other studies found no reduction in unwanted catches of pelagic stingray and overall unwanted fish with different bait types. Two systematic global reviews found that using different bait types did not affect the number of unwanted sharks and rays caught.\nImproved size-selectivity of fishing gear (1 study): One replicated study in the Denmark Strait found that using a different bait species increased the size-selectivity of commercially targeted Greenland halibut.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome static (non-mobile) fishing gears typically attract fish using bait, as opposed to mobile gears that move through the water column to capture fish, or other static gears that passively allow fish to swim into the gear. The use of bait exploits a species’ natural feeding behaviour to increase the chances of capture, for example by encouraging entry into traps where exit is limited, or by taking bait from hook and line and becoming caught on the hook. Static gear fishing is highly dependent on the feeding ecology of the target species (Løkkeborg et al. 2014) and changing the type or size of bait may influence fishing efficiency and the amount of unwanted species or sizes caught. For example, the size of prey consumed is limited by fish gape size (Mittelbach & Persson 1998), and using larger bait may therefore limit the capture of smaller fish, whilst one type of bait may be less attractive to non-target and unwanted species over another and reduce their capture.\nEvidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a different hook type’ and ‘Modify longline configuration’. See also, ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’."
