  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using watchmen to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDamage to agricultural crops by mammalian herbivores may cause substantial losses for some farmers. Although labour-intensive, farmers in some areas may directly guard crops. If this can reduce crop losses to mammals, it could reduce incentive for carrying out lethal control of such species."
