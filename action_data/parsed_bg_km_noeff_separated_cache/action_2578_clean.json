  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on potential prey mammals of providing diversionary feeding for predators. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after study in CanadaÂ found that diversionary feeding of predators appeared to increase woodland caribou calf survival.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredators can limit population sizes of prey species. Changes in habitat or land management can lead to increases in predator populations, which might negatively affect prey. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for reduced predator activities to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproductive success of prey species. Supplementary feeding of predators may be proposed as an alternative strategy that may be regarded as being more acceptable than removal or lethal control."
