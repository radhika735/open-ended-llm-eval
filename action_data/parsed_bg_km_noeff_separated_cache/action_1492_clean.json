  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of manually controlling or removing secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTo avoid overgrowth of the vegetation in the understorey that is typical for many selectively logged forests, this intervention involves manually controlling or removing secondary mid-storey and ground-level re-growth.\n            The clearing of open patches in the forest to reduce undergrowth density is discussed under ‘Clear open patches in the forest’. The removal of trees to reduce density is discussed under ‘Thin trees within forests’."
