  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effects of excluding livestock from semi-natural habitat on mammals. Six studies were in the USA, two were in Spain and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found more small mammal species on areas from which livestock were excluded.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (9 studies): Four out of eight studies (including four site comparisons and four controlled studies), in the USA and Spain, found that excluding grazing livestock led to higher abundances of mule deer, small mammals and, when combined with provision of water, of European rabbits. One study found higher densities of some but not all small mammals species when livestock were excluded and the other three studies found that grazing exclusion did not lead to higher abundances of black-tailed hares, California ground squirrel burrows or of five small mammal species. A site comparison study in Australia found more small mammals where cattle were excluded compared to high intensity cattle-grazing but not compared to medium or low cattle-grazing intensities.\n\n BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves preventing livestock from grazing certain semi-natural habitats, such as grasslands and woodland, to benefit wildlife. Mammal responses may be linked to reduction in competition from domestic herbivores or to changes in the vegetation structure.\n \nSee also Reduce intensity of grazing by domestic livestock for studies where livestock are removed from areas of permanent grassland."
