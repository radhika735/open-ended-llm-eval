  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of training mammals to avoid problematic species. Both studies were in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled study in AustraliaÂ found that training greater bilbies to avoid introduced predators did not increase their post-release survival.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One of two controlled studies in Australia found that greater bilbies trained to avoid introduced predators showed more predator avoidance behaviour, the second study found no difference in behaviour between trained and untrained bilbies.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals raised in areas free of non-native predators may be poorly adapted for use in translocations into areas where they have a greater chance of encountering such predators. This intervention includes cases where attempts are made to expose them to non-native predator cues with the intent that they will be able to avoid these after release. This intervention covers specifically training attempts on wild-born mammals. For captive-born mammals, see: Species management - Train captive-bred mammals to avoid predators."
