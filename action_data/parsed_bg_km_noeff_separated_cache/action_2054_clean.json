  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating injured/orphaned bats on bat populations. Two studies were in the UK, one was in Italy and one in Brazil.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (4 studies): One study in Brazil found that two hand-reared orphaned greater spear-nosed bats survived for over three months in captivity. Two studies in the UK and Italy found that 70–90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4–14 days after release into the wild, and six of 21 bats joined wild bat colonies. One study in the UK found that pipistrelle bats that flew in a large flight cage for long periods before release survived for longer and were more active than bats that flew for short periods or in a small enclosure. One study in the UK found that 13% of ringed hand-reared pipstrelle bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release into the wild.\nCondition (1 study): One study in Brazil found that two orphaned greater spear-nosed bats increased in body weight and size after being hand-reared, and reached a normal size for the species after 60 days.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInjured or orphaned bats may be rehabilitated with the aim of releasing them back into the wild to maintain wild bat populations. This often involves the use of volunteers, which may help to raise awareness for bat conservation. Although bat rehabilitation activities are carried out in many countries, we only found two studies that provide evidence for the effects of this intervention on the survival of rehabilitated bats. We found no studies evaluating the effects of this intervention on maintaining wild bat populations."
