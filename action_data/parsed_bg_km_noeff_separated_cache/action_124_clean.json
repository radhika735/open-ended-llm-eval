  "action_title": "Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree replicated, controlled and randomized studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK found that intercropping cabbage with French beans or clover resulted in increased ground beetle abundance.\nA trial from Switzerland found increased earthworm abundance in a maize plot immediately followed by a rye grass crop.\n\n\nA review found ground beetle numbers were enhanced by intercropping relative to single crops.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nPlanting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Farmland heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003) and so planting multiple crops in a single field may help increase its biological value.\nBenton T.G., Vickery J.A. & Wilson J.D. (2003) Farmland biodiversity: is habitat heterogeneity the key? Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, 182-188."
