This study was in Poland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in Poland reported that after marsh fritillary caterpillar webs were marked before mowing, the number of webs increased the following year.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn productive grasslands, cutting or mowing is used to harvest vegetation, such as for hay or silage, but the process kills or injures the eggs and caterpillars of butterflies and moths living within the grassland (Humbert et al. 2010). However, for conspicuous species, individual caterpillars or their webs can be located and marked prior to mowing so that they can be avoided during the harvest (Błoński 2016), which may increase survival.\nBłoński W.
