  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using flags to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Italy and one was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (5 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Three studies (including two before-and-after studies and a controlled study), in Italy, Canada and the USA, found that flags hanging from fence lines (fladry) deterred crossings by wolves but not by coyotes. A further replicated, controlled study in the USA found that electric fences with fladry were not crossed by wolves. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that fladry did not reduce total deer carcass consumption by a range of carnivores.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nColoured flags (fladry) hung from fences are thought to deter crossings by wolves Canis lupus and potentially other predatory mammals. Thus, the intervention has potential for reducing predation on enclosed livestock. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predatory mammals. The studies include both wild carnivores and captive wolves in experimental trials."
