  "action_title": "Use techniques to increase the survival of species after capture",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small controlled study from the USA found that providing dark, quiet environments with readily-available food and water increased the survival of small birds after capture and increased the probability that they would accept captivity.\nA study from Hawaii found that keeping birds warm in a ‘mock’ translocation in Hawaii increased survival, although all birds suffered some loss of condition.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTranslocations can be a stressful and potentially dangerous procedure, with birds being confined for potentially long periods of time after being captured from the wild. Techniques to maximise survival may therefore be an important part of ensuring the overall success of translocations. In addition, ensuring higher survival can help to reduce the impact of translocations on source populations by requiring fewer individuals to be taken."
