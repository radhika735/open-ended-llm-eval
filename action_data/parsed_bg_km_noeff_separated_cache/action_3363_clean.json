  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of soaking their seeds before sowing. The study was in a greenhouse in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that soaking bulrush seeds in water before sowing typically had no significant effect on their germination rate – especially amongst seeds that had not been manipulated in any other way before soaking.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoaking seeds in water before sowing could increase germination speed and percentages, although the effect may vary between species (Marty & Kettenring 2017). This action involves soaking in water at near-ambient temperatures; other actions consider soaking in chilled or heated water.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak vegetation before planting; Chill seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.\nMarty J.E. & Kettenring K.M.
