  "action_title": "Remove plant litter to maintain or restore disturbance",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of removing plant litter to maintain or restore disturbance. One study was in fen meadow and one was in a fen.\nPlant community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one randomized, one paired, before-and-after) in a fen meadow in Germany and a fen in Czech Republic found that removing plant litter did not affect plant community composition.\nVegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Czech Republic found that removing plant litter did not affect bryophyte or tall moor grass cover.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a fen meadow in Germany reported that removing plant litter increased plant species richness and diversity. However, one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a fen in the Czech Republic found that removing litter did not affect vascular plant diversity.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTraditional management such as mowing, grazing and burning can prevent build up of plant litter (dead material). Some fens and fen meadows have been mown for hundreds of years to produce animal feed or bedding (Güsewell 2003). However, many historically cut peatlands have been abandoned over the past 60 years, especially those in remote areas (Middleton et al. 2006). Accumulation of litter may affect the growth of some or all plants by influencing temperature, light and nutrient availability (Weltzin et al. 2005). Litter also creates a physical barrier above growing seedlings and below any seeds that fall on top of it (Facelli & Pickett 1991).\nRemoving vegetation litter by hand may mimic some of the disturbance caused by traditional management. To be included as evidence in this section, studies must have examined the effect of litter removal alone (not, for example, the effect of removing litter from mown plots).\nCaution: Disturbance is not desirable on all peatlands. Fen meadows and some fens may benefit from disturbance. Many other fens, bogs and peat swamps will not. In fact, accumulation of dead plant matter is fundamental to the process of peat formation.\nRelated action: prescribed burning, which will clear plant litter as part of its wider effects on peatland vegetation.\nFacelli J.M. & Pickett S.T.A.
