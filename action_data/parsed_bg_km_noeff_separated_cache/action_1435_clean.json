Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere are a variety of practices and improvements relating to nutrient and water use, disease and pest control, soil fertility, and livestock production that could each contribute to increased agricultural efficiency.
