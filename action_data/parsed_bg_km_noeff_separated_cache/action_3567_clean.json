  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of recovering lost or discarded fishing gear.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAbandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to aquatic reptiles. Sea turtles in particular are at risk of becoming entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Recovering derelict fishing gear from marine and freshwater environments may reduce the risk of mammal entanglement. However, derelict gear may be difficult to locate and retrieve. Specialist techniques may be required, such as acoustic sonar surveys, aerial surveys, or underwater diver and camera surveys (Drinkwin 2018).\nFor studies on the avoidance of losing or discarding gear see Prevent the loss and discard of fishing gear and related debris. For studies relating to the removal of other garbage see Remove garbage and other solid waste from terrestrial, aquatic and coastal environments.\nDrinkwin J.
