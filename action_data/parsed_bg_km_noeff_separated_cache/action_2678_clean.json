  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of allowing only small-scale traditional (artisanal) fishing in an area on marine fish populations. The study was in the Adriatic Sea (Italy).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Adriatic Sea found that a marine protected area zone allowing only artisanal fishing activity for three years had higher overall commercial catch rates of five of seven species compared to unprotected areas openly fished.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtisanal fisheries are the commercial component of small‐scale coastal fisheries mostly practiced using traditional methods. They are particularly important in some areas such as the Mediterranean where they constitute about 80% of the fishing fleet (Marengo et al. 2015). Artisanal fishing uses a large range of gear types and techniques but is typically operated by a single fisher or a pair of fishers. They target a high number of species, but the fishing methods employed are generally low technology and non-destructive. Allowing only artisanal fishing in an area helps to regulate fishing pressure while balancing conservation and socio-economic needs of local communities, many of whom rely on marine resources. Co-management agreements involving the artisanal fishers may also encourage compliance and may be more easily used to adapt the local fishing effort and/or selectivity to avoid overfishing.\nMarengo M., Culioli J.M., Santoni M.C., Marchand B. & Durieux D.H.
