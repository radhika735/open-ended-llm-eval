  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of altering road surfaces on reptile populations. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in Canada found that paved roads were not used more by Blandingâ€™s turtles than unpaved roads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDue to the way that reptiles regulate their body temperature using external sources, it is possible that sun-warmed roads surfaces may contribute to road-related mortality. Gravel roads are cooler than surrounding natural habitats and may offer an intervention option to prevent reptiles from crossing roads (Shine et al. 2004).\nShine R., Lemaster M., Wall M., Langkilde T. & Mason R. (2004) Why did the snake cross the road? Effects of roads on movement and location of mates by garter snakes. Ecology and Society, 9, 9."
