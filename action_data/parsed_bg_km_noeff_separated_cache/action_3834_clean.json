  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of practising wildlife gardening on butterflies and moths. Two were in the UK and one was in each of France and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that areas with reduced frequency weeding had a similar species richness of adult butterflies compared to areas with conventional weeding.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study) in the UK and the USA found that increasing the number and age of potted nettle plants in gardens and weeding less frequently did not increase abundance of butterflies, all caterpillars and caterpillars and eggs of four target species. One replicated, site comparison study in France found that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used and where there were natural features had a higher abundance of butterflies, but gardens where fungicides and snail pellets were not used had a lower abundance of butterflies.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): One replicated study in the UK reported that caterpillars only occasionally used potted nettle plants in gardens. One site comparison study in the UK found that planted buddleia and marjoram were visited by adult butterflies and moths more frequently than other plant species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWithin urban areas, public parks and private gardens represent a significant area of potential habitat. Wildlife-friendly gardening could include a number of independent actions for butterflies and moths, such as planting nectar-rich flowers or native plant species, reducing the frequency of weeding or cutting, and reducing chemical impacts, as well as actions aimed at other wildlife. This action includes studies where two or more of these are carried out together, as well as less frequently tested actions.\nThis action includes studies where non-native plants are used to provide nectar resources. For studies exclusively testing the planting of native species, see “Plant parks and gardens with appropriate native species”. See also “Alter mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges”, “Pollution – Stop using herbicides on pavements and road verges” and “Pollution – Stop using pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspace”."
