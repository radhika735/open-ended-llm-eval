  "action_title": "Exclude livestock from semi-natural habitat (including woodland)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies (including four replicated controlled trials of which one also randomized, and a review) from Ireland, Poland and the UK looked at the effects of excluding livestock from semi-natural habitats. Three studies (including one replicated controlled and randomized study) from Ireland and the UK found that excluding livestock benefited plants and invertebrates. \nThree studies (one replicated controlled and one replicated paired sites comparison) from Ireland and the UK found that excluding grazing did not benefit plants or birds. \nTwo studies (one replicated and controlled, one review) from Poland and the UK found that the impact of excluding grazing as a tool in habitat restoration was neutral or mixed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention involves preventing livestock from grazing certain semi-natural habitats such as grasslands to benefit farmland wildlife such as rare plants.\nSee also ‘Reduce grazing intensity on grassland (including seasonal removal of livestock)’ for studies that excluded livestock from areas of permanent grassland."
