  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of maintaining the microclimate in an abandoned mine on bat populations. The study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nClosing mines and physically obstructing mine entrances can alter the internal microclimate and make conditions unsuitable for roosting bats. Adverse impacts on airflow and water drainage should be avoided. For a similar intervention, see ‘Restore and maintain microclimate in modified caves’. See also ‘Install and maintain cave gates to restrict public access’ for a study in which a stone wall and gate influenced the microclimate of a cave with an effect on hibernating bats."
