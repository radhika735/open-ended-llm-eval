  "action_title": "Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange in brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were in the same estuarine site in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted California cordgrass Spartina foliosa reached a similar height, after three growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.\nIndividual plant size (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted salt marsh herbs reached a similar overall size, after 1–2 growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in a salt marsh in the USA found that planted salt marsh herbs typically had similar survival rates, after 1–2 growing seasons, in areas with an excavated tidal creek and areas without a tidal creek.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves increasing the frequency or duration of flooding by tides in areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. Tidal exchange could be facilitated by breaching sea walls or embankments, installing or widening culverts, excavating tidal creeks, or opening/closing sluice gates. Tidal wetlands may be brackish/saline (e.g. mangroves, coastal marshes) or freshwater (e.g. at the upstream end of estuaries, as in the Mississippi, Yangtze, and Elbe rivers; Baldwin et al. 2009).\nRelated actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes; Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.\nBaldwin A.H., Barendregt A. & Whigham D.
