  "action_title": "Chill tree/shrub seeds before sowing: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of brackish/saline wetlands – of chilling their seeds before sowing.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nExposing seeds to cold temperatures before planting can help to break seed dormancy and encourage germination. Some species with physiological dormancy must experience a cold period before germinating, in order to break down chemicals that inhibit germination or stop the production of these chemicals. For a database of seed dormancy class by species, see Baskin & Baskin (2014).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species,\nRelated actions: Soak seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.\nBaskin C.C. & Baskin J.M.
