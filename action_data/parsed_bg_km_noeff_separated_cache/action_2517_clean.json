  "action_title": "Translocate mammals away from sites of proposed energy developments",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals away from sites of proposed energy developments. One study was in Brazil and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): A study in Brazil found that lesser anteaters translocated away from a hydroelectric development site remained close to release sites while a study in Australia found that at least one out of eight chuditchs translocated from a site to be mined returned to its site of capture.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals may be vulnerable to habitat destruction at sites of developments such as energy generation installations or mines. If permission is granted for such developments to go ahead, translocating mammals away from the site may be a way of attempting to mitigate the effects of the development.\nFor related studies, see interventions within Species Management- Translocate Mammals."
