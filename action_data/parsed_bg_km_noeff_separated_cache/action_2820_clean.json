  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustic decoys to divert mammals away from fishing gear. The study was in the Gulf of Alaska (USA).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One study in the Gulf of Alaska found that increasing the distance between an acoustic decoy device and fishing lines resulted in fewer sperm whales at the lines, but sperm whale presence and time of arrival did not differ.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDecoy devices may be used to divert marine and freshwater mammals away from fishing gear to reduce the risk of entanglement or capture. This may also reduce mammal predation on fish catches thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict."
