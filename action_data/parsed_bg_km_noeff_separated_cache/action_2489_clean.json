  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on elephants of using bees to deter crop damage to reduce human-wildlife conflict. All three studies were in Kenya.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including one controlled study), in Kenya, found that beehive fences reduced crop raiding by African elephants.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConflicts between farmers and free-ranging elephants occur in parts of Africa. Farmers on small plots may loose large proportions of their crops to raids by elephants. Some elephants are said to be wary of foraging near African honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata (Vollrath & Douglas-Hamilton 2002). Thus, fences comprising bee hives linked by wires may deter entry to fields by elephants, as well as providing a further potential crop (honey) for farmers. If successful, the intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of elephants.\n \nVollrath F. & Douglas-Hamilton I. (2002) African bees to control African elephants. Naturwiss, 89, 508–511."
