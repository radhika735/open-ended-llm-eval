  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of retaining or increasing leaf litter or other types of mulch on reptile populations. One study was in Indonesia and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that reptile species richness increased with the addition of leaf litter and decreased following removal of leaf litter and woody debris.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): Two randomized, controlled studies (one replicated, before-and-after study) in Indonesia and Australia found that the addition of leaf litter or cacao husks resulted in a higher abundance of overall reptiles or skinks. One study also found that removal of leaf litter and woody debris led to a decrease in reptile abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe presence of leaf litter is an important driver of reptile abundance in both temperate (Hu et al. 2013) and tropical forests (Heinen 1992). Adding leaf litter or other mulch to woody crops such as cacao may provide habitat for reptile communities.\nFor studies that leave woody debris after logging activities or add woody debris to the landscape see Threat: Biological resource use – Leave woody debris in forests after logging, and Habitat restoration and creation – Add woody debris to landscapes.\nHeinen J.T.
