  "action_title": "Apply herbicide and remove plants to control grass",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the USAÂ found that areas sprayed with herbicide and weeded to control non-native grass cover had higher cover of native grasses and forbs than areas that were not sprayed or weeded, but not a higher number of native plant species. The same study found that spraying with herbicide and weeding reduced non-native grass cover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCombining the application of herbicide with removal of grass may help to reduce the abundance of problematic grass species, and thus help shrubland plants to increase in size and cover."
