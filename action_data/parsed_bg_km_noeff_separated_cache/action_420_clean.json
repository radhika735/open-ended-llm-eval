  "action_title": "Reduce predation by translocating nest boxes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo studies from Europe found that predation rates were lower for relocated nest boxes, compared to controls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany predators optimise their hunting by searching areas where they have previously been successful. This potentially makes birds nesting in nest boxes vulnerable – they cannot move nesting sites and can lose their clutches year after year if a predator learns their location. Moving nest boxes between years may, therefore, reduce predation and increase reproductive success. This is not the same as translocating birds from an area of high predation to a safer location. Studies describing this intervention are discussed in a separate section within ‘General responses to small/declining populations’."
