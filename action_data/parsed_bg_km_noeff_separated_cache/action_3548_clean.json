Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial fishing and harvest quotas (such as ‘Total Allowable Catch’) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources i.e. species stocks. Setting catch quotas for specific fisheries (for instance cod), can potentially reduce the pressure on other species not targeted by the fishery but commonly affected or caught during fishing operations.\nSee also: Set unwanted catch quotas."
