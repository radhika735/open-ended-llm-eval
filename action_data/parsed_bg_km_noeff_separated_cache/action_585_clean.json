  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies from North America, the Galapagos and the Azores found that seabirds were more likely to nest in areas where vocalisations were played, or were successfully attracted to nest in new areas, following the playing of vocalisations. Four of these studies used several interventions at once. One study found that some calls were more effective than others.\nTwo studies from the USA and the Galapagos found that birds did not colonise all new areas where vocalisations were played. It is possible that the result from the Galapagos was due to only having a single year’s data.\nOne controlled study from Hawaii found that albatross were more likely to land in areas where vocalisations were played than in areas without vocalisation playback. A small controlled study from New Zealand found that terns were not more likely to land in areas where vocalisations were played.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs well as physically moving birds to areas (translocations, see separate intervention), it is possible to try and get birds to move of their own accord. Many birds nest colonially for protection and are attracted nesting to areas with conspecifics. Especially for birds that land mainly at night, hearing the calls and other vocalisations of conspecifics may be an important part of guiding them to colonies. Playing recordings of these calls may therefore encourage birds to colonise new areas. A similar intervention is ‘Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas’."
