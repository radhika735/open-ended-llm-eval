  "action_title": "Relocate nestlings to reduce poaching",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated before-and-after study in Venezuela found significant decreases in poaching rate and increased fledging rates of parrots after wild chicks were moved into police premises each night.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNestlings are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, as they cannot fly and are confined to nests. This is especially problematic with species such as parrots that are exploited for the pet trade, as nestlings can be easily raised in captivity and sold on. Moving nestlings into safer areas may reduce the threat of exploitation, but is likely to be expensive or time-consuming. In the study below, chicks were taken from nests overnight and then returned in the morning, something that is only likely to be possible for species under very intense management."
