  "action_title": "Prohibit certain gear types",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of prohibiting certain gear types on marine fish populations. One study was in the Indian Ocean (Kenya) and one was in the Kattegat (Sweden/Denmark).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean found that in an area where all but one gear type was prohibited there was a higher fish density compared to areas where just one gear type was prohibited and to unrestricted areas.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Kattegat found that a combination of areas in which non-selective gear types were prohibited and long-term fishery closures reduced unwanted catch of cod compared to before.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial fishing is carried out using many different gear types, and each has its own characteristics regarding fishing power and selectivity (the potential to catch only the intended species and/or sizes of fish). Prohibiting certain gear types while allowing others may help to reduce the effects of excessive fishing effort and selective fish removal that may be particular to an area or species due to the fishing method(s) used.\nEvidence for related interventions is summarized under 'Spatial and Temporal Management'."
