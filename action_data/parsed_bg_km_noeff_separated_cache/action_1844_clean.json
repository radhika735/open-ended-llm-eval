  "action_title": "Raise awareness amongst the public (general)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of interventions to raise general public awareness about peatlands on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. The study reported effects on unspecified peatlands. \nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in the UK reported that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe public could be educated about the importance of peatlands, threats they face and what can be done to protect them. Messages could be conveyed through information boards, talks, art projects, adverts, leaflets, celebrity endorsements and social media.\nThis section considers the effectiveness of awareness-raising about peatlands in general (e.g. their biodiversity and value for humans) and education about simple actions to prevent damage to peatlands (such as using peat-free compost and avoiding products containing palm oil) which might develop markets for sustainably produced peatland products.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring; provide education/training programmes about peatlands."
