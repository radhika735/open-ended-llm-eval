  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated and controlled study from Kenya, of five studies captured, found that burned areas of savanna tended to have more birds and more species than control or grazed areas. However, the authors note that differences were not present during drought years and burned sites showed significant annual variation, unlike grazed sites. A replicated and controlled study from Australia found that the effects of burning on bird abundances depended on burn season, and habitat type.\nTwo replicated studies in the USA found that some open country species were more common in burned areas than unburned, whilst other species were less so.\nA small study from the USA found that two eastern bluebird Sialia sialis successfully raised chicks after the habitat around their nest boxes was subject to a prescribed burn.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeriodic wildfires and grazing/browsing by wild animals maintained open savanna ecosystems in parts of the world, retarding woody plant encroachment and succession to woodland. In some regions where these natural processes have been lost, and where active fire suppression may have also occurred, rotational burning may be used to reinstate and maintain more open habitat conditions amenable. Other methods commonly used include thinning of trees and shrubs, timber harvesting, and livestock grazing.\nThere is a continuum between habitats classified as ‘savannas’ and those classified as ‘forests’ and ‘grasslands’. Relevant information for management of habitats with both trees and grasses may, therefore, be found in all three sections."
