  "action_title": "Remove surface soil/sediment (before planting)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing surface soil/sediment before planting emergent marsh/swamp plants.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe surface soil/sediment – and any vegetation on it – could be removed from degraded wetlands, creating a new bare surface for planting vegetation. This new surface may have fewer nutrients and other pollutants, no undesirable seed bank, no hard crust and be wetter since the surface is now closer to the water table.\nCaution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002). Soil removal can also have counter-intuitive effects, such as increasing ammonium concentrations because nitrifying bacteria, which break down ammonia, have been removed (Dorland 2004). Soil removal can be time consuming and expensive.\nRelated actions: Remove surface soil/sediment, other than to complement planting; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting; Transplant wetland soil before/after planting.\nCampbell D.A., Cole C.A. & Brooks R.P.
