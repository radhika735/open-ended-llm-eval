  "action_id": "1180",
  "action_title": "Use brash mats during harvesting to avoid soil compaction",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of using brash mats during harvesting to avoid soil compaction on forests.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing heavy machinery during harvesting may compact the soil and limit seedling regeneration. Remaining woody debris from harvested trees (brash) can be used to cover the ground and form mats. This may spread out the weight of heavy machinery and decrease soil compaction."
