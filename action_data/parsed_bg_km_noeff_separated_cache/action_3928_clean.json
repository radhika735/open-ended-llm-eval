  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing rice field banks to benefit butterflies and moths. This study was in Italy.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Italy found that unmown, herbicide-free rice field banks had a greater species richness of butterflies than banks which were mown or sprayed with herbicide.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Italy found that unmown, herbicide-free rice field banks had a higher abundance of butterflies, including large copper, than banks which were mown or sprayed with herbicide.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRice paddy fields are unusual among agricultural habitats as they normally have banks as field boundaries (rather than hedgerows, walls or ditches). The banks are often managed to reduce vegetation cover, either by spraying with herbicide or by mechanical cutting (Giuliano et al. 2018). However, reduced management may enable vegetation cover to develop and flower abundance to increase, which may benefit butterflies and moths.\nGiuliano D., Cardarelli E. & Bogliani G. (2018) Grass management intensity affects butterfly and orthopteran diversity on rice field banks. Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 267, 147–155."
