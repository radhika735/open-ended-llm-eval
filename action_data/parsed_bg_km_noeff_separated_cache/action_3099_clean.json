  "action_title": "Manage water level to control problematic plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of managing water levels to control problematic plants in marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTemporarily increasing or decreasing water levels could help to control problematic plants in marshes or swamps. An elevated water table may kill upland plants that cannot tolerate long periods in saturated soils, or kill submerged plants by reducing the amount of light reaching them. Prolonged flooding, especially after another treatment like cutting or burning, may kill emergent vegetation (Hellings & Gallagher 1992). Lowering water levels may create exposed or dry soils, killing aquatic plants.\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Lower water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Actively manage water level (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).\nHellings S.E. & Gallagher J.L.
