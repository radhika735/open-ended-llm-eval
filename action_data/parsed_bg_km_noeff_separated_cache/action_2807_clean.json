  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials. Two studies were in the Bay of Fundy (Canada) and one study was in each of the Fortune Channel (Canada), the North Sea (Denmark) and the South Atlantic Ocean (Argentina).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): One controlled study in the Fortune Channel found that harbour porpoises approached nets made from acoustically reflective material (barium sulfate) and conventional nets to similar distances and for similar durations, but porpoises used fewer echolocation clicks at barium sulfate nets. One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy found that harbour porpoise echolocation activity was similar at barium sulfate and conventional nets.\n\nOTHER (3 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (3 studies): Two of three controlled studies (including two replicated studies) in the North Sea, the Bay of Fundy and the South Atlantic Ocean found that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets. The other study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce the number of dolphin entanglements.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing acoustically reflective fishing gear materials, such as nylon infused with chemicals or metal oxides, may increase the detectability of gear for marine and freshwater mammals that use echolocation. This may allow mammals to avoid fishing gear reducing the risk of entanglements. However, it should be noted that using gear materials that are acoustically reflective can also change the density, stiffness and/or colour of the gear, making it difficult to determine which mechanism is causing a deterrent effect (Larsen et al. 2007, Mooney et al. 2007).\nLarsen F., Eigaard O.R. & Tougaard J.
