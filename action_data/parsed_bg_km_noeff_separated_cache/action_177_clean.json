  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThe one study of six that investigated species richness found no difference in species richness between a UK site with wildlife-friendly hedge management and three control sites.\nSeven studies from the UK and Switzerland, five replicated, found that some species studied increased in relation to managed hedges or were more likely to be found in managed hedges, compared to other habitats. Two investigated several interventions at once. \nOne replicated study found that species that showed positive responses to hedge management in some regions showed weak or negative responses in other parts of the UK. Four studies from the UK found that some species declined or showed no response to wildlife-friendly management of hedges.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHedges can be key habitats for farmland biodiversity, but they may need managing to maximise their value. Managing hedges to benefit wildlife involves one or more of the following management changes: reduce cutting frequency; reduce or avoid spraying; mowing vegetation beneath hedgerows or filling gaps in hedges."
