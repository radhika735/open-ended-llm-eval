  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of releasing males that guard nests during the breeding season on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removal of male fish known to guard nests or protect their young during the breeding season not only kills the adult but may prevent successful spawning or rearing of the young and limit the overall reproductive potential of the population. Examples include black bream Spondyliosoma cantharus (Pinder et al. 2017) and lingcod Ophiodon elongatus (Withler et al. 2004). Releasing male fish of these species during breeding may help reduce fishing pressure and the effects of overexploitation and protect the hatching or rearing of young fish.\nPinder A.C., Velterop R., Cooke S.J. & Britton J.R.
