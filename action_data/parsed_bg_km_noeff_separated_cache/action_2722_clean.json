  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effects of fitting a size-sorting mesh funnel (sieve net) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net on marine fish populations. All three studies were in the North Sea (Belgium, UK).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (3 STUDIES) \n\nReduction of unwanted catch (3 studies): Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea found that shrimp trawls fitted with a mesh size-sorting funnel, a sieve net, reduced the catches of unwanted (non-commercial or discarded) fish, compared to standard trawls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is considered a non-selective method of fishing as large proportions of fish that enter the gear may be retained in the net. To help reduce the capture of unwanted fish, a sieve net (a “bycatch reduction device”) can be used to help sort the catch into different species or sizes and allow the escape of some. A sieve net is attached to the full circumference of prawn or shrimp trawl nets and tapers to an apex near the trawl’s codend. An exit opening is made where the sieve net and codend join, allowing fish and other larger animals to pass through the sieve and escape, whereas the shrimp pass through the sieve and into the codend (Revill & Holst, 2004). Mesh sieve or sorting panels work in a similar manner, intending to separate unwanted species from prawn catches by mechanical and behavioural means (Santos et al. 2018).\nEvidence for a similar intervention relating to prawn/shrimp trawl nets is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Fit a size-sorting escape grid (rigid or flexible) to a prawn/shrimp trawl net’.\nRevill A. & Holst R.
