  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial nests or nesting sites on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA and one study was in each of the Galápagos, Spain, China, Reunion Island, Canada and Jamaica.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (6 studies): Two studies (including one before-and-after study) on Reunion Island and Jamaica found that the number of Reunion day gecko eggs and Jamaican iguana hatchlings at artificial nesting sites increased over time. One of two replicated, controlled studies in Canada and the USA found that hatching success of eggs from four species of freshwater turtle moved to artificial nest sites was higher than for eggs left in natural sites. The other study found that hatching success of diamondback terrapin nests in artificial nest sites compared to natural sites varied depending on the substrate used. One study in Spain found that eggs laid in an artificial nest by an Iberian wall lizard hatched and those placed in artificial nests had high hatching success. One replicated study in the USA found that fewer diamondback terrapin nests were predated in artificial nesting mounds protected with an electric wire than in mounds with no wire.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (8 STUDIES)\n\nUse (8 studies): Four of seven studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the Galápagos, Spain, Reunion Island, Canada, the USA and Jamaica found that artificial nest sites were used by captive Galápagos giant tortoises, Iberian wall lizards, four species of freshwater turtle and diamondback terrapins. Two studies found that use of artificial nest sites increased over time for Reunion day geckos and Jamaican iguanas. The other study found that artificial nest sites were used infrequently by northern map turtles. One study in China found that artificial nesting materials were used by some Chinese alligators.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProviding artificial nesting sites or nests may give reptiles the opportunity to lay eggs in appropriate settings where the natural environment is lacking.\nFor studies discussing the provision of artificial shade due to high temperatures for nesting sites or nests, see Threat: Climate change and severe weather – Provide artificial shade for nests or nesting sites."
