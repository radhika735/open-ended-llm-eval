  "action_id": "786",
  "action_title": "Protect brownfield or ex-industrial sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of protecting brownfield sites on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBrownfield sites include land that was once used for industrial or other human activities, but is then left disused or partially used, for example, disused quarries or mines, demolished or derelict factory sites, derelict railways or contaminated land. Natural recolonization of these sites can result in valuable habitats for wildlife and provide migration corridors in built-up or disturbed areas."
