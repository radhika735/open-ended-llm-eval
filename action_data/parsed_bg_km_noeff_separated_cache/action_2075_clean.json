  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting mining on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in the Bering Sea (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate community composition became similar to that of an unmined site.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One  site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate richness and diversity became similar to that of an unmined site.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that following cessation of gold mining, overall invertebrate abundance and biomass became similar to that of an unmined site.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine mining involves the retrieval of minerals from the seabed, usually through dredging. While certain minerals mostly occur in the deep sea, where mining is yet to be undertaken at an industrial scale, offshore and coastal mining does occur in parts of the world (Miller et al. 2018). Mining can have negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbances from dredging operations, chemical contamination, and changes in sediment characteristics (Jewett et al. 1999). Mining could be ceased (for instance following end of licence or voluntary cessation of activities) or prohibited (through legislation) in an area, and the site and its invertebrates left to naturally recover over time (Jewett et al. 1999).\n \nJewett S.C., Feder H.M. & Blanchard A.
