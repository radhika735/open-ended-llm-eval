  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of delaying or ceasing operations if marine and freshwater mammals are detected within a specified zone on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nActivities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving, dredging, explosives and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). Delaying or ceasing such activities for a specified time if marine or freshwater mammals are detected within an ‘exclusion’ zone may help to reduce negative impacts and the risk of injury. This may involve using trained observers, acoustic monitoring and/or automated systems to detect mammals (Verfuss et al. 2018).\nBailey H., Senior B., Simmons D., Rusin J., Picken G. & Thompson P.M.
