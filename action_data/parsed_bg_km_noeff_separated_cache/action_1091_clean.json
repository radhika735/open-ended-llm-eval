  "action_title": "Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Change salinity of the water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nOne of two replicated laboratory studies (one controlled) in Canada and the UK found that increasing the salinity level of water killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours. One found that increased salinity did not kill invasive killer shrimp.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFreshwater gammarid shrimps are sensitive to increased levels of salt in the water. Addition of salt to the water, or exposure to sea water therefore offers a potential management tool."
