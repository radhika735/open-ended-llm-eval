  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of mining waste (tailings) at sea or in rivers on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMine tailings (the ore waste of mines, typically in the form of a mud-like material) originate from both coastal and land-based mining activities and can be disposed of in aquatic environments causing chemical contamination. Ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of mining waste at sea or in rivers may reduce pollution and potential harm to marine and freshwater mammals."
