  "action_title": "Shield lights to reduce mortality from artificial lights",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that fewer Newellâ€™s shearwaters Puffinus newelli were found grounded when security lights were shielded, compared to nights when they were not.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLights that are not designed to be seen as warnings can be shielded, so that the light from them is directed down (or in the required direction). This can reduce the light projected into the sky and therefore the visibility and attractiveness of the lights to birds."
