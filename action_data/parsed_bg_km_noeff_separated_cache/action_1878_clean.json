  "action_title": "Amphibians: Manipulate adult density within the enclosure",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of manipulating adult density within the enclosure.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBy manipulating animal densities, particularly around the breeding season, aggressive behaviour could be minimised. Also, eggs are less likely to be damaged if fewer adults are kept in the same enclosure. Alternatively, some species may require higher densities to trigger breeding."
