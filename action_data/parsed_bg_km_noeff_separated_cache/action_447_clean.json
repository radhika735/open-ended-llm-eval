  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single small, before-and-after study in Mauritius found no snail-caused chick mortality in 2004–7 after the installation of copper strips at seven echo parakeet Psittacula eques nest holes, compared to four fatalities in 2003–4.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn Mauritius, the critically endangered echo parakeet Psittcaula eques has a very small breeding population and low reproductive output. In 2002–4, four chicks were found dead having been covered in slime and suffocating after African giant land snails Achatina spp. (introduced to Mauritius and many other islands for food) moved other them.\nSnails are deterred from moving over copper due to a reaction between their slime and the metal, and trials in Mauritius showed that Achatina individuals did not move over copper strips. A snail exclusion barrier was therefore tested."
