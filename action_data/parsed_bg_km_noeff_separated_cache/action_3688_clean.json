  "action_title": "Protect nests and nesting sites from predation using artificial nest covers: Snakes & lizards",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using artificial nest covers on snake and lizard populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing temporary individual nest covers may be a preferred way of protecting reptile nests when predator removal is difficult (for example due to the predator’s ecology), or when it is considered to be unethical (for example involving controls on endangered species), unpopular (for example charismatic or native predators) or too costly (Buzuleciu et al. 2015).\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians.\nFor studies that use fencing to exclude predators from larger areas, see Remove or control predators using fencing and/or aerial nets.\nBuzuleciu S.A., Spencer M.E. & Parker S.L. (2015) Predator exclusion cage for turtle nests: a novel design. Chelonian Conservation and Biology, 14, 196–201."
