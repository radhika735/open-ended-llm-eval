  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing plant litter from freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted marshes in the USA found that plots cleared of plant litter contained a plant community characteristic of wetter conditions than uncleared plots after one growing season – but not after two.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that plots cleared of plant litter contained a similar number of wetland plant species to uncleared plots, after 1–2 growing seasons.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE                                                         \n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted marshes in the USA found that plots cleared of plant litter had greater cover of wetland plants than uncleared plots after one growing season – but not after two.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAccumulation of dead plant matter, or litter, can cause undesirable changes to marsh plant communities. Litter can affect temperature, light and nutrient availability (Weltzin et al. 2005) and act as a barrier to seedlings from below and seeds from above (Facelli & Pickett 1991). Litter removal may be necessary after abandonment or suppression of disturbance.\nCaution: Litter accumulation is an important process in some wetlands, contributing organic matter to the soil. Where it is desirable to remove litter, removal by hand may cause less damage to soils and vegetation than using heavy machinery. Be aware that seeds of desirable plants may be removed along with the litter.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have examined the effect of litter removal alone (not, for example, the effect of removing litter from mown plots, or the combined effect of mowing and litter removal).\nRelated actions: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance and Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance, both of which could help to clear plant litter.\nFacelli J.M. & Pickett S.T.A.
