  "action_title": "Asian clams: Exposure to parasites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the use of parasite exposure to control Asian clams.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nParasites have the potential to control clam populations by reducing production of offspring, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death. Studies in Asian clams Corbicula spp. have focussed on their use as a tool for monitoring water-borne parasites of interest to humans, rather than identifying parasites that may regulate clam populations."
