  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEleven studies evaluated the effects of using circle hooks instead of J-hooks on reptile populations. Five studies were in the Atlantic, three were in the Pacific and one study was in each of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and North Pacific and the western North Atlantic, Azores, Gulf of Mexico and Ecuador.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (3 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, controlled, paired study) off the coast of Hawaii and in the north-east Atlantic Ocean found that survival of loggerhead and leatherback turtles and leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles caught by circle hooks or J-hooks was similar. One review of studies in five pelagic longline fisheries found that fewer sea turtles died when circle hooks were used compared to J-hooks in four of five fisheries.\nCondition (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the Mediterranean Sea and south-western Atlantic Ocean found that fewer immature loggerhead turtles and loggerhead turtles swallowed circle hooks compared to J-hooks. One before-and-after study off the coast of Hawaii found that a lower percentage of loggerhead and leatherback turtles were deeply hooked by circle hooks compared to J-hooks.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (11 STUDIES)\n\nUnwanted catch (11 studies): Seven of 10 studies (including six replicated, controlled studies) in the Pacific, Atlantic, Atlantic and North Pacific and Mediterranean and one review of studies in five pelagic longline fisheries found that circle hooks or circle hooks and tuna hooks caught fewer sea turtles than J-hooks, or that non-offset G-style circle hooks caught fewer leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles that offset J-Hooks. One of these studies also found that circle hooks caught slightly larger loggerhead turtles than J-hooks, and one also found that offset Gt-style circle hooks caught a similar number of leatherback and hard-shell sea turtles compared to offset J-hooks. One study found that circle hooks caught a similar number of leatherback, green and olive ridley turtles compared to J-hooks. One study found that fish-baited circle hooks caught fewer loggerhead and leatherback turtles than squid-baited J-hooks. The review found mixed effects of using circle hooks compared to J-hooks on unwanted catch of sea turtles depending on the fishery. The other study found mixed effects of using circle hooks or J-hooks in combination with squid or fish bait on the number of loggerhead and leatherback turtles that were caught.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSea turtles are vulnerable to being hooked in the mouth or swallowing hooks on longline fishing hooks when foraging for bait attached to the hooks. They may also be hooked in the body or become entangled in the longlines when swimming in the vicinity of lines that have been set.\nThree main types of fishing hooks are typically used in longline fisheries: J-hooks, tuna hooks, and circle hooks. J-hooks are shaped like a ‘J’, with the hook point parallel to the hook shaft. Circle hooks are more rounded than J-hooks with the hook point turned in so that it is at right-angles to the hook shaft (FAO 2009). Tuna hooks are shaped in between a J-hook and a circle hook.\nUsing circle hooks may reduce unwanted catch compared to J-hooks because they are wider and so may be less likely to fit into a turtle’s mouth. They may also reduce the incidences of turtles swallowing hooks, thereby increasing the chances of turtles surviving after being caught and released (Ryder et al. 2006).\nThis action includes studies that discuss comparisons between different types of circle hook with different types of J-hook. See Use non-offset hooks, Use non-ringed hooks, and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test these variations in hook design.
