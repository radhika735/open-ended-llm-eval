  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of using traps instead of fishing nets on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study took place in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that the combined amount of unwanted catch of invertebrates and fish appeared lower using plastic traps than trammel nets, but higher using collapsible traps.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that the catch of commercially targeted lobsters was lower using traps than in trammel nets.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing nets can have poor selectivity, leading to high amounts of unwanted catch, and also can negatively impact the seabed and benthic communities due to physical contact and disturbance (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016). Although fishing nets and traps usually target different species and are used in different fisheries,  in certain cases, they can target and catch the same species. Replacing fishing nets with traps and pots where feasible can help reduce the impacts on invertebrate populations, through a reduction in physical disturbances and a reduction in unwanted catch. For instance, trammel nets used in lobster fisheries could be replaced with traps (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016).\nEvidence for other interventions related to trap and pot fishery is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Modify the position of traps”, “Modify the design of traps”, “Use a different bait species in traps”, “Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps” and “Fit one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps”.\n \nAmengual-Ramis J.F., Vazquez-Archdale M., Canovas-Perez C. & Morales-Nin B.
