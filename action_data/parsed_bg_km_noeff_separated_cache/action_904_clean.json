  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: Two site comparison studies from Italy and Pakistan (one also replicated) found a higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems.\nNutrient loss: One study from Canada found lower nutrient levels and yields in low-input systems.\n \nSOIL TYPES COVERED: coarse sandy, loam, sandy-loam, and silt.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Functional diversity is the value and range of functional roles (or ‘traits’) that organisms play in a given ecosystem (Tilman 2001), in this case the agro-ecosystem. Highly diverse and active soil organisms indicate good soil health.\nTilman D. 2001. Functional diversity. Pages 109-120 in: S.A. Levin (ed.) Encyclopedia of Biodiversity. Academic Press, Waltham, USA."
