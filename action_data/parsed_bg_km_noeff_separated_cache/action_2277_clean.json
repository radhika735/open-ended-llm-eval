  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting the harvesting of scallops on their populations. One study was in the South Atlantic Ocean (Argentina), one in the English Channel (UK) and one in the Irish Sea (UK).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nScallop abundance (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in the South Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel, and the Irish Sea found that in areas where scallop harvesting had stopped scallop abundance was similar, and one found that scallop biomass was higher, compared to harvested areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial harvesting of scallops is usually undertaken using dredges, and as such can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through removal of untargeted species and damage to the seabed. Recreational and artisanal scallop fishing may cause less impact due to the smaller scale of the operations and the harvesting methods used (for instance hand-harvest). Nevertheless, both harvesting methods have negative consequences on scallop populations, particularly if harvesting levels are unsustainable. Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvesting of scallops in an area, potentially allowing scallop populations to recover over time (Bull 1989; Schejter et al. 2008).\nWhen this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and cease or prohibit harvesting of scallops”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit scallops dredging” and “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit dredging”.\n \nBull M.F.
