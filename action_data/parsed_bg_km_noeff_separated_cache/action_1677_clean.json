  "action_title": "Restore/create habitat connectivity between shrublands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of restoring or creating habitat connectivity between shrublands on shrublands.\n\n'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIncreasing connectivity between sites may help to maintain interactions between plant and animals such as pollination and seed dispersal, which can aid survival of plant populations and increase plant diversity (Beier and Noss, 1998).\nBeier, P., & Noss, R. F. (1998). Do habitat corridors provide connectivity? Conservation Biology, 12(6), 1241-1252."
