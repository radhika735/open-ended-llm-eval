  "action_title": "Water primrose: Public education",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the impact of education programmes on control of water primrose.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOnce escaped in the wild, fragmentation of water primrose Ludwigia spp. and resultant dispersal can result from a variety of management and recreational activities.  Teaching users how to clean equipment in a way that decreases the chance of transmission is one way to lessen the impact of human-mediated transport.  Educating the public about the dangers this plant poses outside of its native range may also help reduce the number of new introductions.\nNumerous educational campaigns have been directed at informing the public about the danger of aquatic invasive species in countries in Europe to which water primrose poses a threat. Governmental organizations disseminate educational materials about the identification and control of Ludwigia spp."
