  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated study in the USA found that provision of live prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFor some carnivores, providing live invertebrates is a good form of feeding enrichment as it stimulates natural hunting behaviours. For example, providing crickets in a dispenser which is put under a mound, or placing crickets inside a pumpkin are methods which have been tried with some small felid species.\n   Wooster, D.S. 1997.
