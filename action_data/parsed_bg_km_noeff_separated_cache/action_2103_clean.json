  "action_title": "Cease or prohibit static fishing gear",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of ceasing or prohibiting static fishing gear on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Static fishing gear such as pots and traps, although usually considered less damaging than mobile gears, can be locally damaging to the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates directly located under or in their vicinity. Ceasing or prohibiting static gears in an area, for instance through bylaws or voluntary agreements (Blyth et al. 2002), can remove their direct pressure to subtidal benthic invertebrates and allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Blyth et al. 2004). When the cessation of static fishing gear occurs in the context of a marine protected area, the evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit static fishing gear”.\n \nBlyth R.E., Kaiser M.J., Edwards-Jones G. & Hart P.J.B.
