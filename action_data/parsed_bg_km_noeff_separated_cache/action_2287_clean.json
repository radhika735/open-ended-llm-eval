  "action_title": "Protect bats within roosts from disturbance or predation by native species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting bat roosts from disturbance or predation by native species on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRoosting bats can be vulnerable to disturbance or predation by native species. Modifying roost entrances to exclude problematic species may protect bats within roosts. For example, metal sheeting may be placed below a roost entrance to prevent mammalian predators from climbing up to the roost (e.g. see Schofield 2008).\nSee also ‘Control invasive predators’ and ‘Control invasive non-predatory competitors’.\nSchofield H.W.
