  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using infrastructure to reduce vehicle collision risk along roads. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One controlled study in the USA reported that “altitude guide” netting, and poles topped with bright colours or flowers (attractive features), did not alter the behaviour of Oregon silverspot around roads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCollisions with vehicles on roads represent a serious mortality risk for butterflies and moths, especially for low-flying species which rarely go above the height of standard cars. For example, between 1 and 11% of 95 road crossings by Oregon silverspot Speyeria zerene hippolyta resulted in mortality (Zielin et al. 2016). Artificial structures may be used to try to encourage butterflies and moths to fly higher before crossing the road, therefore reducing the chances of collisions with vehicles.\nZielin S.B., Littlejohn J., de Rivera C.E., Smith W.P. & Jacobson S.L. (2016) Ecological investigations to select mitigation options to reduce vehicle-caused mortality of a threatened butterfly. Journal of Insect Conservation, 20, 845–854."
