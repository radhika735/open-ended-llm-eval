  "action_title": "<i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Bury plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on the use of burying with soil alone to control Crassula helmsii.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLightproof barriers have been shown to be effective in removing C. helmsii in some cases, and burying the plant under soil could be another potential approach. This could be carried out at the same time as creating a new pond, using the soil that is dug out to fill in a C. helmsii-infested water body. Studies investigating the use of burying with soil once a lightproof barrier has been put in place are discussed in ‘Use lightproof barriers’."
