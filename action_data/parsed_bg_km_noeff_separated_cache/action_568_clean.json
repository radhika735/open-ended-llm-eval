  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo studies from Australia and one from New Zealand found that colonies of burrow-nesting Procellariiformes were successfully established on two islands, and in uninhabited areas of another following the translocation and hand-rearing of chicks.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany species of Procellariiformes (petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses) breed on offshore or oceanic islands and have suffered severe population declines and local extinctions due to introduced mammalian predators. Although many islands have now been cleared of predators, Procellariiformes show very strong homing instincts and return to the area they fledged from to breed. This means that birds are unlikely to recolonise islands, or even other areas of the same island, even if it is safe. Translocations may therefore be a suitable way to increase the range and population size of these species. Using decoys and vocalisations are also possible methods to encourage recolonisation, these are discussed later in this chapter (‘Use vocalisations to attract birds to safe areas’ and ‘Use decoys to attract birds to safe areas’)."
