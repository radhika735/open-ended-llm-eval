  "action_title": "Carnivores: Alter feeding schedule according to visitor activity",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of altering feeding schedule to visitor activity on captive carnivores.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAnimal behaviour can be influenced by the presence of zoo visitors [1]. Responses to visitor activity are often species- and individual-specific and consequently adjusting visiting times according to the needs of specific animals might improve their welfare.\n[1] Margulis, S.W., Hoyos, C., Anderson, M. 2003.
