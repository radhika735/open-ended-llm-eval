  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of installing physical supports for emergent, non-woody plants planted in freshwater wetlands. The study was in the Netherlands.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nBiomass/plant (1 study): One replicated, controlled study at the edge of a freshwater lake in the Netherlands found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on biomass of individual plants after 1–2 years.\nStems/plant (1 study): The same study found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on number of shoots/plant after 1–2 years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanted vegetation could be supported with structures such as stakes or wire mesh. Supports may be used in areas disturbed by wind, waves or human activity to hold vegetation in place whilst it establishes.\nRelated actions: Use fences or barriers to protected planted areas."
