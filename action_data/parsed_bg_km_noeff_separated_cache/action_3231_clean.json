  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding sediment to existing brackish/salt marshes. All five studies were in the USA. Two studies were based on one experimental set-up and two studies were based on another.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nRelative abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically supported a greater relative abundance of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than degraded marshes after two years, but that this typically remained lower than in natural marshes.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically had greater plant species richness than degraded marshes, and statistically similar richness to natural marshes, after two years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically had greater total vegetation cover than degraded marshes, and statistically similar cover to natural marshes, after two years.\nIndividual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, all four studies (including two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) of salt marshes in the USA found that adding sediment typically increased the abundance of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, over approximately 1–5 years. This is based on total biomass, density and/or cover. One of the studies reported that adding sediment increased the cover of three other species after one year.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that the height of the dominant plant species, smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, did not significantly differ between plots amended with sediment and unamended plots. Height was measured 16 months after sediment amendment began.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding small amounts of sediment to marshes is a possible action to counter multiple threats. These include: sea level rise; subsidence (e.g. following oil and gas extraction); reduced sediment inputs following the construction of levees, flood control structures or jetties; and erosion from storms or boat traffic or following excessive grazing (Reed & Wilson 2004). Adding sediment can physically raise the ground surface and provide nutrients to vegetation. In turn, vegetation can physically protect and stabilize wetlands, and encourage further sediment deposition. Sediment or sediment slurry could be added directly to a focal site, or placed nearby then transported to the focal site by natural process (Foster 2013).\nFactors that might influence the effects of this action include the amount of sediment added, and whether any vegetation is present before sediment addition.\nRelated actions: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure; Transplant or replace wetland soil in order to introduce marsh vegetation.\nFoster N.M., Hudson M.D., Bray S. & Nicholls R.J.
