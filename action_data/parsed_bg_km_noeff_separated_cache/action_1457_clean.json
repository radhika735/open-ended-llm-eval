  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in Brazil found that black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road.\nOne before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased after the construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps.\nOne before-and-after study in Madagascar found that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRope and pole bridges, or so-called ‘canopy bridges’, allow safe crossing of human-made barriers (e.g. roads) by arboreal primates that spend most of their time in the forest canopy.\n     The use of green bridges (overpasses) to re-connect primate habitat and avoid primate road kills is discussed under ‘Install green bridges (overpasses)’.\n \nTeixeira F.Z., Printes R.C., Fagundes J.C.G., Alonso A.C. & Kindel A.
