  "action_title": "Provide artificial nesting sites for grebes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single study from the UK found that grebes used nesting rafts in some areas of the UK but not others, and that the characteristics of used rafts differed geographically.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLike divers/loons, grebes are highly specialised for swimming and diving and are therefore vulnerable on land. Providing artificial islands or floating rafts may increase both the number of birds nesting at a site, and their reproductive success."
