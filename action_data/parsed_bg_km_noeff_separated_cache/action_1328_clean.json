  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in the UK and Madagascar found that when food was hung in trees in an outdoor enclosure, less time was spent feeding on food in the indoor enclosure.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in the UK reported that monkeys spent longer feeding in bowls positioned at the top of an enclosure than in bowls positioned on the floor.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the wild, many primates avoid foraging on the ground if they have the option. This is to decrease the risk of predation. The aim of maximising horizontal and vertical presentation of food is to increase more natural foraging behaviour."
