  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLimiting the number of fishing vessels or days in which an area can be fished may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This may involve the rotation of fishing areas. Careful planning may be required to ensure that fishing effort is not redirected to other areas with a high mammal density."
