  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDrying out of amphibian breeding sites, either permanently or before terrestrial life stages have developed, can have significant detrimental effects on populations. It may be possible to maintain temporary ponds by deepening them or by artificially increasing water levels. Grazing may also help to maintain ponds as a study found that temporary pools that had not been grazed for three years dried 50 days earlier than grazed pools (Pyke & Marty 2005). Studies investigating the effects of grazing on amphibians are discussed in ‘Threat: Agriculture – Manage grazing regime’.\nPyke C.R. & Marty J. (2005) Cattle grazing mediates climate change impacts on ephemeral wetlands. Conservation Biology, 19, 1619–1625."
