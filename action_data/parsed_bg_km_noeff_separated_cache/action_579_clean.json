  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll four studies (including one site      comparison and two replicated trials) from the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands investigating the effects of habitat      corridors or restoring areas of natural or semi-natural habitat between      existing patches found some degree of colonization of these areas by invertebrates      or mammals. However for invertebrates one unreplicated site comparison      reported that the colonization process was slow (Gruttke 1994), and three studies found that the extent of      colonization varied between invertebrate taxa. \nOne small, replicated study from the Czech Republic investigated      colonization of two bio-corridors by small mammal species. It found more small      mammal species in the bio-corridors than in an adjacent forest or arable      fields.\nAll three studies from Germany and the Netherlands looking at the effects on      invertebrates found mixed results. One replicated study found more species      of some wasps (cavity-nesting wasps and caterpillar-hunting wasps) in      grass strips connected to forest edges than in isolated strips. An unreplicated study found that the abundance of      three ground beetle species substantially increased in an arable field      undergoing restoration to heathland but that typical heathland species      failed to colonize over the 12 year period.      One study found that two out of 85 ground beetle species used a meadow      and hedge-island strip extending from semi-natural habitats into arable      farmland. In the      same study the habitat strip did not function well for ground      beetles and harvestmen but was colonized by snails and spiders.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves the creation of habitat corridors between currently isolated natural/semi-natural habitats or the restoration of natural/semi-natural habitats between existing patches.\nHabitat fragmentation, as well as destruction, may be an important driver of population declines. Small areas hold fewer species than large ones and if individuals are unable to cross areas of converted habitat then populations in separate habitat patches will become isolated. This potentially makes them more vulnerable to extinction, from natural variations in birth and death rates or sex ratios, from inbreeding depression and from outside pressures; both natural (such as storms or wildfires) and man-made (such as hunting or continued habitat loss). However the precise effects of habitat fragmentation, as opposed to loss, are debated (e.g. Fahrig 1997).\nTheoretically, the number of species surviving in a habitat fragment is determined by its size and its effective distance to other habitat patches (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). Connecting remaining areas of natural or semi-natural habitat is therefore often seen as a way to increase the viability of populations, but there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of such ‘wildlife corridors’ (e.g. Beier & Noss 1998).\nMacArthur R.H. (1967) The Theory of Island Biogeography. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.\nFahrig L. (1997) Relative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on population extinction. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 61, 603–610.\nBeier P. & Noss R.F. (1998) Do habitat corridors provide connectivity? Conservation Biology, 12, 1241–1252."
