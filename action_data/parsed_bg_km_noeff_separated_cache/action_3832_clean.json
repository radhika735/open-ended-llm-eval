  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining connectivity between habitat patches. One study was in each of the USA, the Netherlands and Estonia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Estonia found that well connected cleared patches within a woodland had a similar species richness of butterflies to isolated cleared patches.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that low quality habitat patches which were well connected were more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches, but connectivity did not affect occupancy of high quality patches.\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that common buckeye were more likely to colonize farther away habitat patches if they were released on corridors of suitable habitat than if released in unsuitable habitat, but there was no difference when released close to habitat patches.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat connectivity is important for enabling animals to colonize new sites, and can be important for the persistence of a population which exists in fragmented sites across a landscape (Johansson et al. 2017, van Langevelde & Wynhoff 2009). Small habitat patches are more likely to be occupied if they are located close to larger, occupied patches (Sinclair 2002, Thomas & Harrison 1992). Fragmented habitats attract fewer butterflies than more intact habitats (Summerville & Crist 2001), and retaining connectivity may increase habitat use by butterflies and moths.\nFor studies on creating habitat corridors, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore or create habitat connectivity”.\nJohansson V., Knape J. & Franzen M.
