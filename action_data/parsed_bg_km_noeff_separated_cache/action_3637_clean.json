  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects of using selective logging in forests on reptile populations. One study was in each of Brazil, the USA and Mexico.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Mexico found that areas with low intensity selective logging tended to have similar reptile species richness compared to areas with high intensity selective logging.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies (including one before-and-after study) in Brazil and the USA found that selective logging intensity had mixed effects on the abundance of three lizard species. The other study found that areas with selective logging had similar reptile abundance compared to areas with combined clearcutting and thinning.\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSelective logging is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clearcutting, which entails removing all trees at the same time. The idea behind selective logging is to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well. Selective logging of mature forest involves targeting the harvest of trees based on specific criteria. This might be based on size of tree, tree health, or tree species, for example."
