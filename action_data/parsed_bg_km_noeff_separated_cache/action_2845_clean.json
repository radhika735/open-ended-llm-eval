  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of setting limits on feeding of marine mammals by tourists. The study was in Shark Bay (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in Shark Bay found that after setting limits on feeding of bottlenose dolphins by tourists, the survival of calves born to females being fed increased and was similar to calves of non-fed mothers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe feeding of wild marine and freshwater mammals at tourist destinations can have negative impacts on mammal behaviour and population dynamics (Mann & Kemps 2003). This intervention involves limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the feeding of marine and freshwater mammals by tourists to reduce these effects. Enforcement may also be required to prevent illegal feeding (Powell et al. 2018).\nMann J. & Kemps C.
