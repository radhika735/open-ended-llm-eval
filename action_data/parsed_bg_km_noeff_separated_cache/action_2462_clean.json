  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals in larger unrelated groups. Two studies were in South Africa, one was in Namibia and South Africa, one was in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (3 studies): A replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that black-tailed prairie dogs translocated in larger groups had higher reproductive success than smaller groups. A study in South Africa found that Cape buffalo translocated to a fenced reserve as a larger group formed a single herd and reproduced, whilst a smaller group separated. A study in South Africa found that rehabilitated and captive-bred cheetahs released in groups (unrelated and family) and as individuals reproduced.\nSurvival (4 studies): A replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that black-tailed prairie dogs translocated in larger groups had higher initial daily survival rate than smaller groups. Two studies (one controlled) in Namibia and South Africa and Australia found that releasing translocated black rhinoceroses and burrowing bettongs in larger groups did not increase survival. A study in South Africa found that most adult rehabilitated and captive-bred cheetahs released in groups (unrelated and family) and as individuals survived at least one year.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): A replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that black-tailed prairie dogs translocated in larger groups attracted more immigrants than smaller groups. A study in South Africa found that Cape buffalo translocated as a larger group formed a single herd and stayed in the fenced reserve, whilst a smaller group scattered and escaped the reserve.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals are sometimes wild-caught and translocated or bred in captivity and released to re-establish populations that have been lost, or to augment an existing population. This action includes studies comparing the effects of translocating or releasing mammals in larger, unrelated groups (i.e. not family or social groups), rather than in smaller groups (which might include as few as one animal). This may be done for a variety of reasons, such as increased protection against predators, greater access to potential mates or social groups and an increased chance of establishing self-sustaining breeding populations.\nStudies of unrelated translocated mammals that were held together to form social groups prior to release, or unrelated captive-bred animals raised and released together are described in Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in family/social groups.\nStudies of releases of unrelated animals that were not held together, and where the effect of group size was not tested, are described in Translocate to re-establish or boost population in native range and Release captive-bred individuals to re-establish or boost population in native range."
