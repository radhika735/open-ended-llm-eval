  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in Germany, the UK and USA found that translocated and naturally colonizing toads established breeding populations in created ponds, or in one case 33% of created ponds. Two before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark and Switzerland found that common toads and midwife toads naturally colonized 29â€“100% of created ponds, whereas captive-bred garlic toads did not colonize. One before-and-after study in Denmark found that creating and restoring ponds, along with head-starting, increased populations of European fire-bellied toads.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in Switzerland found that midwife toads reproduced in 16% of created ponds.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs there is a larger literature for natterjack toads Bufo calamita and green toads Bufo viridis than other species, evidence is considered in separate sections."
