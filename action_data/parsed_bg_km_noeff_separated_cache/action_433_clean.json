  "action_title": "Use buffer zones to reduce the impact of invasive plant control",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA study from the USA found that having buffer zones around snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis nests, where no herbicides were sprayed, resulted in no nests being lost during a vegetation control programme.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nControl efforts for invasive or problematic species can be very destructive and if not performed carefully may damage native species. We captured one study attempting to reduce the impact of invasive water plant control on snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis nests, which are built above water in cattail Typha spp. and bulrush Scripus validus and are therefore vulnerable to herbicide applications, which can kill supporting vegetation, collapsing the nests."
