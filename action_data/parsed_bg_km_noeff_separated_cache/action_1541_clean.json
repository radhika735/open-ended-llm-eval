  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years despite being quarantined before release, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements after being quarantined before release, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Madagascar found that most reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs did not survive over five years despite being quarantined before release, alongside other interventions.\nOne before-and-after study in Malaysia found that a population of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 40 years despite individuals being quarantined before release, alongside other interventions. A controlled study in Indonesia found that all orangutans that underwent quarantine prior to release, alongside other interventions, survived over three months.\nOne before-and-after, site comparison study in the Republic of Congo and Gabon found that more than 80% of the reintroduced gorillas that underwent quarantine, alongside other interventions, survived over a ten year period.\nTwo site comparison studies in Vietnam and a before-and-after study in Indonesia found that most reintroduced lorises either died or their radio signal was lost despite being quarantined before release, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention aims to prevent the spread of viral and bacterial diseases from newly introduced primates to resident primate populations. Quarantine programmes are designed to facilitate the detection of transmittable diseases and make accurate assessments of the overall health status of individuals and/or groups coming into contact with a new population. They are defined by their duration and by the activities and procedures practised to assess health status.\n            Implementing quarantine for people to prevent the spread of viral and bacterial diseases from humans to primates is discussed under ‘Implement quarantine for people arriving at, and leaving the site’."
