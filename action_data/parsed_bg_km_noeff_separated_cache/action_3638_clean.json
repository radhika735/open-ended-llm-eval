  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of reseeding logged forest on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that reptile communities in areas that were reseeded were not more similar to mature forest stands than those left to regenerate naturally.\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that areas that were reseeded had similar reptile species richness and diversity compared to areas left to regenerate naturally.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that areas that were reseeded had similar reptile abundance compared to areas left to regenerate naturally.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves re-seeding logged forest to re-establish tree communities after cutting, as opposed to leaving forest to regenerate naturally."
