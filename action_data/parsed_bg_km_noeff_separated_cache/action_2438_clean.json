  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of keeping livestock in enclosures to reduce predation by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in Portugal.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated study in Portugal found fewer wolf attacks on cattle on farms where cattle were confined for at least some of the time compared to those with free-ranging cattle.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFree-ranging livestock may be more vulnerable to attacks by predators than those contained indoors or in enclosures close to farm buildings. Here we consider the effectiveness of such methods of animal husbandry. If successful, this intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators. See also Exclude wild mammals using ditches, moats, walls or other barricades to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
