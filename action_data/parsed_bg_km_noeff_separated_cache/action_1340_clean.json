  "action_title": "Primates: Provide access to food at all times (day and night)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of providing primates access to food at all times (day and night).\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDifferent species of primates show huge variation in their natural diets with some wild animals spending a considerable amount of time foraging for food (up to 70%), this could be during the day or at night. In captivity food needs to be offered in a manner and frequency appropriate to the species, to provide variety, with the aim of promoting the foraging and social feeding behaviour seen in the wild."
