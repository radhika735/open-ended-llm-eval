  "action_title": "Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces, on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAntifouling paints and coatings are commonly used to manage ‘biofouling’ (organisms that attach to hard surfaces) on aquaculture gear (cages, nets, ponds) and other hard anthropogenic structures. However, some antifouling paints and coatings are highly toxic to aquatic wildlife, including marine and freshwater mammals. Tributyltin (TBT), for example, was widely used on vessels and has been found to accumulate in marine mammal tissues, with potentially lethal effects (Kannan et al. 1997). Using non-toxic or natural antifouling coatings (e.g. Magin et al. 2010, Kirschner & Brennan 2012) may reduce the risk of toxicity to marine and freshwater mammals.\nKannan K., Senthilkumar K., Loganathan B.G., Odell D.K. & Tanabe S. (1997) Elevated accumulation of tributyltin and its breakdown products in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) found stranded along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
