  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammal movements of installing automatically closing gates at field entrances to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in USA.\n\nKEY COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, controlled study, in the USA found that vehicle-activated bump gates prevented white-tailed deer from entering enclosures.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWild mammals can compete with domestic herbivores for food, can predate domestic herbivores or can damage crops. Human-wildlife conflict can be reduced if wild mammals can be effectively excluded from fields. Gates through fences can provide crossing points if there is a risk of the gate being left open. Gates that close automatically may reduce the risk of wild mammals entering such fields. If successful, this may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such mammals."
