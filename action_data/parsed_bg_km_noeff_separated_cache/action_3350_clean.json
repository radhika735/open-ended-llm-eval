  "action_title": "Add root-associated fungi to plants before planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects – on emergent wetland plants – of adding root-associated fungi before planting.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany marsh and swamp plants form mutually beneficial associations with fungi (Cooke & Lefor 1998). These ‘mycorrhizal’ fungi live in or around plant roots. They can increase plant access to nutrients and minimize the effect of stresses such as drought and pollution (Finlay 2008). Adding mycorrhizal fungi vegetation before it is introduced could therefore help survival and growth. Fungi could be added via a root dip, or by adding spores to the surrounding soil.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated plants. Studies that simply report the performance of treated plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated interventions: Apply root dip to plants before planting, including all non-fungal treatments (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).\nCooke J.C. & Lefor M.W.
