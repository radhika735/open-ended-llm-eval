  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe availability of water in arid areas is predicted to decrease under future climate change scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2014). Desert bats depend on these water resources for both drinking and foraging (Razgour et al. 2010) and reduced water availability can affect their survival and reproductive success (Adams & Hayes 2008). Studies that experimentally reduced desert pond sizes to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change found reduced bat activity and species richness, particularly for larger, less manoeuverable bat species (Razgour et al. 2010, Hall et al. 2016, Razgour et al. 2018).\nFor evidence relating to artificial water sources, see ‘Create artificial water sources’.\nAdams R.A. & Hayes M.A. (2008) Water availability and successful lactation by bats as related to climate change in arid regions of western North America.
