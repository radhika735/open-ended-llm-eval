  "action_id": "1423",
  "action_title": "Relocate primates to non-residential areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of relocating primates to non-residential areas on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrimates may cause hazards to humans and their property in residential areas. For example, they may enter private homes, steal food, and cause damage to properties. Primates that live in/near residential areas may also injure people and represent a health hazard, as they can transmit various diseases to humans and vice versa. In an effort to protect both primates and humans, primates may be relocated to areas that are less densely populated by humans, or natural areas. This intervention may be implemented before the building of the residential area or at a later stage in response to primates invading an existing residential area."
