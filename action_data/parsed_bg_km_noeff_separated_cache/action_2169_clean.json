  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the sale and/or transportation of commercial non-native species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native, invasive and other problematic species can be introduced through trade, for instance by purchasing and using non-native live bait for angling (Kilian et al. 2012) or the importation of microalgae for aquaculture feed (Campbell 2011). Restricting or ceasing the sale and transportation of such species, as well as putting additional management controls in place such as disposing of live non-native species on land rather than at sea, may potentially help reduce the risk they pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates, through a reduction in introduction and spread.\n \nCampbell M.L. (2011) Assessing biosecurity risk associated with the importation of microalgae. Environmental Research, 111, 989–998.\nKilian J.V., Klauda R.J., Widman S., Kashiwagi M., Bourquin R., Weglein S. & Schuster J.
