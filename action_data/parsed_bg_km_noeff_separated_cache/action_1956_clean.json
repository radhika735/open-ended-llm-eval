  "action_id": "1956",
  "action_title": "Reduce rotor diameter",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing rotor diameter on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nStudies of patterns of bat fatalities at existing wind farms in Europe and the USA found that mortality increased with rotor diameter in some studies (Rydell et al. 2010), but not in others (Barclay et al. 2007, Georgiakakis et al. 2012).\nBarclay R.M.R., Baerwald E.F. & Gruver J.C.
