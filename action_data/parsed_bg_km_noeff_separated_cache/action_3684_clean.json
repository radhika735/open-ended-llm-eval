  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of keeping domestic cats indoors at times when reptiles are most active.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDomestic cats Felis catus are a potentially significant predator of wild reptiles (Woods et al. 2003; Cecchetti et al. 2020), and this impact may be particularly pronounced in those areas with no native feline species (Woinarski et al. 2018). Keeping cats indoors at times of high reptile activity may substantially reduce their impact on wild populations.\nCecchetti M., Crowley S.L. & McDonald R.A.
