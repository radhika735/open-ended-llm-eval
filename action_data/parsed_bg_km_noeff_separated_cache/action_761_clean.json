  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies (including four replicated studies) in Australia, Estonia and the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management and in some cases release of animals, increased numbers of frog species, or increased, stabilized or maintained populations of natterjack toads. One before-and-after study in the UK found that vegetation clearance, along with other habitat management, maintained a population of great crested newts for the first six years, but not in the longer term.\nOne before-and-after study in England found that vegetation clearance, resulted in increased occupancy by natterjack toads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVegetation can be removed to prevent natural succession where specific habitat types are desired, or where invasive species are out-competing native species for example.\nStudies that used fire or removed vegetation in forest are discussed in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications – Use prescribed burning’, ‘Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation’ and ‘Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation’.\nStudies that investigated the effect of removing aquatic plants are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Remove specific aquatic plants’, ‘Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species – Control invasive plants’ and as one of a combiniation of restoration management actions in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Restore wetland’ and ‘Restore ponds’."
