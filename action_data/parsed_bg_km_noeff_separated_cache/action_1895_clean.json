  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of allowing adults to attend their eggs.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome amphibian parents defend their clutches, carry them on their backs or directly nurse their young (caecilians). By providing the right conditions for these species to carry out natural parenting behaviour it may be possible to increase tadpole survival."
