  "action_title": "Reduce the intensity of lighthouse beams",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of reducing the intensity of lighthouse beams on bird mortality.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLess intense lighthouse beams may be seen by birds from less far away, or prove less attractive. However, as lighthouse beams are designed to be extremely bright and visible, dimming them may not be feasible."
