Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHigh vehicle speed is generally considered to be a substantial contributing factor in wildlife-vehicle collisions. Slower road speeds allow drivers to identify and avoid wildlife, as well as allowing reptiles the time necessary to cross roads. Speed limits can be reduced in areas where there are high numbers of collisions, either permanently or during seasonal migrations.\nSee also Use signage to warn motorists about wildlife presence."
