  "action_title": "Strengthen cultural traditions that discourage bat harvesting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of strengthening cultural traditions that discourage bat harvesting on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpecies that provide an important cultural resource can be highly revered. For example, a study in the Solomon Islands found that bat teeth are used traditionally as currency, and the authors suggest that this tradition could be used to highlight the cultural value of bats and encourage sustainable hunting and conservation (Lavery & Fasi 2017).\nLavery T.H. & Fasi J. (2017) Buying through your teeth: traditional currency and conservation of flying foxes Pteropus spp. in Solomon Islands. Oryx, 1–8."
