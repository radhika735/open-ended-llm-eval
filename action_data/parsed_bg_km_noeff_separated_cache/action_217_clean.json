  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small UK study found that a site with beetle banks had increasing populations of rare or declining species, although several other interventions were used on this site. A literature review from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix populations were far larger on sites with beetle banks and other interventions than on other farms. Two replicated studies from the UK also investigated population-level effects: one found that no bird species were strongly associated with beetle banks; the second found no relationship between beetle banks and grey partridge population density trends.\nA UK literature review found that two bird species nested in beetle banks and that some species were more likely to forage in them than others. A study in the UK found that one of two species used beetle banks more than expected. The other used them less than other agri-environment options.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBeetle banks are grassy mounds, about 2 m wide, that run across the middle of large arable fields. They are intended to provide habitat, especially during winter, for predatory insects such as beetles and spiders and therefore could also provide foraging habitats for birds."
