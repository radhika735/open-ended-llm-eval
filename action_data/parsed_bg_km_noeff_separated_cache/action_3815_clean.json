  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of establishing move-on rules for temporary, targeted fishing restrictions or closures when a catch or unwanted catch threshold is reached on marine fish populations. One study was in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea (Scotland) and one was in the North Atlantic Ocean (Scotland).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in in the North Atlantic Ocean/North Sea found that after move-on rules were established when a catch threshold limit triggered temporary fishing closures there were lower overall cod discards.\nReduction of fishing effort (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one replicated and controlled) in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea found that after move-on rules were established for vessels when a catch threshold limit was reached fishing effort for cod and blue ling was reduced.\nCommercial catch abundance (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one replicated and controlled) in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea found that after move-on rules were established for vessels when a catch threshold limit was reached commercial landings of cod and blue ling were reduced.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMove-on rules require fishing activity to reduce or cease in an area. They may be triggered by catch thresholds being reached, or by a single sighting or capture for some protected species. The rules may involve temporary fishing restrictions including total closure of an area and/or moving to an alternative area with lower fish abundance of the species concerned located a minimum distance away. Establishing move-on rules may immediately limit fishing effort and reduce fish mortality."
