  "action_title": "Use stiffened materials or increase tension of fishing gear",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using stiffened materials in fishing nets. The study was in the South Atlantic Ocean (Argentina).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (1 study): One controlled study in the South Atlantic Ocean found that using stiffened fishing nets did not reduce the number of Franciscana dolphin entanglements.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing stiffened materials or increasing the tension of fishing nets, ropes or lines may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled. However, tensioned vertical ropes may cause injuries to mammals that come into contact with them (Baldwin et al. 2012).\nFor another intervention that may involve stiffened gear, see Use acoustically reflective fishing gear materials.\nBaldwin K., Byrne J. & Brickett B.
