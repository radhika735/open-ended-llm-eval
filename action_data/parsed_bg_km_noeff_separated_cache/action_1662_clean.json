  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in the USAÂ found that using fences to exclude deer increased the height of shrubs, but not shrub cover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHigh densities of large herbivores such as deer or non-native feral livestock have been shown to reduce species diversity and limit the regeneration of shrublands in some parts of the world (Perea et al. 2014). Using fences to exclude these species from shrublands may help plants to increase in height and cover.\nPerea, R., Girardello, M. & San Miguel, A. (2014) Big game or big loss? High deer densities are threatening woody plant diversity and vegetation dynamics. Biodiversity and Conservation, 23, 1303-1318."
