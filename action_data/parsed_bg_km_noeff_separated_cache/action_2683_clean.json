  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effect of deploying fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species on marine fish populations. Three studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (Florida, Brazil, Canary Islands), and one study was in each of the Pacific Ocean (Hawaii) and the Tasman Sea (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (5 STUDIES)\nReduction of unwanted catch (5 studies): Four of five replicated studies (three controlled, one paired and controlled) in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Tasman Sea found that deploying fishing gear (longlines, handlines and traps) at selected depths, including above the seabed instead of on it, reduced the unwanted catches of five of 17 fish species, three of eight shark/ray species, non-commercially targeted fish species and Harrison’s dogfish, compared to depths usually fished. The other study found that different shark species were hooked at different depths in the water column during bottom-set longlining deployments.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe depths fish are found throughout the water column depends not only on the species and their preferred habitat, but also on factors such as behaviour (e.g. for feeding or spawning) and age structure. It is also highly influenced by environmental conditions like water temperature and salinity, among others, and may change over short timescales, such as different times of the day. Different fishing gears exploit the known depth distributions of fish and are deployed either on the seabed or at specific depths in the water column to maximise catches of the desired fish (aided by sonar technology in many cases). Conversely, this knowledge may also be used to avoid the capture of fish, potentially rare or threatened species and commercial unwanted species or sizes.\nEvidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected times (day/night) to avoid unwanted species’ and ‘Selectively avoid unwanted fish based on temperature distribution’."
