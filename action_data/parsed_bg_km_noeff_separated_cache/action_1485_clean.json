  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLogging is the third greatest threat to primates in all regions worldwide (Estrada et al. 2017). Selective logging is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clear-cutting, which entails removing all trees at the same time. The idea behind selective logging is to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well. Selectively logged areas can sustain primates at varying densities, depending on the logging intensity and history (e.g. Bortolamiol et al. 2014). Although several correlative studies have shown that high logging intensity spatially correlates with low primate density (e.g. Weisenseel et al. 1993) and local extinction in very heavily-logged or clear-cut areas (e.g. Ancrenaz et al. 2010), in some moderately-logged areas, densities of some primate species, including eastern chimpanzees Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and western gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla for example, were reported to be relatively high (e.g. Bortolamiol et al. 2014, Stokes et al. 2010). For orangutans Pongo pygmaeus morio, a simulation study by Wilson et al. (2014) has suggested that reduced-impact logging practices, coupled with additional protection may be a strategy that could even outperform habitat protection.\nFor best ‘Best Practice Guidelines for Reducing the Impact of Commercial Logging on Great Apes in Western Equatorial Africa’ published by the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group (PSG), please refer to Morgan & Sanz (2007).\n \nAncrenaz M., Ambu L., Sunjoto I., Ahmad E., Manokaran K., Meijaard E. & Lackman I.
