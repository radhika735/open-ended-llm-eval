  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of installing a pump on or above the seabed in docks, ports, harbour, or other coastal areas to increase oxygen concentration on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study was in Osaka Bay (Japan).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study in Osaka Bay found that installing a pump on the seabed of a port to mix seawater and increase oxygen concentration led to an increase in combined invertebrate and fish species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in Osaka Bay found that installing a pump on the seabed of a port to mix seawater and increase oxygen concentration led to an increase in combined invertebrates and fish abundance.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitats and invertebrate populations within many ports, harbours, and docks around the world have deteriorated due to anthropogenic pressures, such as pollution and eutrophication, and the consequent decline in water quality and oxygenation (Russell et al. 1983). Improving water quality to these environments, for instance by increasing water mixing and oxygenation, can be achieved by installing a pump underwater. Installing a pump can help increase oxygen concentration in seawater, improve overall water quality, and potentially help promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity (Russell et al. 1983; Yamochi & Oda 2002).\n \nRussell G., Hawkins S.J., Evans L.C., Jones H.D. & Holmes G.D.
