  "action_title": "Implement small and dispersed logging compartments",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of implementing small and dispersed logging compartments on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention is particularly important for territorial primate species that live in social groups with spatially well-defined home ranges. If logging were conducted at multiple sites within an area similar to the size of the primate species core range and over a short span of time, then an entire social group could be displaced. It has therefore been recommended that relatively small logging compartments that will be exploited simultaneously should lie at a distance of each other that equals at least the distance between different groups/communities (Morgan & Sanz 2007).\nÂ \nMorgan D. & Sanz C.
