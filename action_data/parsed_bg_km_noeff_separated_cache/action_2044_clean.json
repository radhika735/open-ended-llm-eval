  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of educating farmers, local communities and pest controllers to reduce indiscriminate culling of vampire bats.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats may be indiscriminately killed by farmers and local communities in attempts to reduce the spread of rabies. Providing education about vampire bats and non-lethal measures to prevent the spread of rabies may reduce unnecessary killing of bats. A study in Costa Rica found that men who knew more about bat ecology (from previous education programmes and/or watching television) were less likely to have intentions to indiscriminately kill bats (Reid et al. 2016).\nInterventions relating to non-lethal measures of rabies control are described in ‘Replace culling of bats with non-lethal methods of preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to livestock’ and ‘Replace culling of bats with non-lethal methods of preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to humans’.\nReid J.L. (2016) Knowledge and experience predict indiscriminate bat-killing intentions among Costa Rican men. Biotropica, 48, 394–404."
