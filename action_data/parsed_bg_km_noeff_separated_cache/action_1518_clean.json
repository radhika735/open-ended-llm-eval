  "action_title": "Protect important food/nest trees before burning",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of protecting important food/nest trees before burning on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrimates depend on trees for finding food, building nests and seeking shelter. These species may suffer population declines if fires damage the trees they depend on for survival. Protecting important food/nest trees may help reduce this negative effect."
