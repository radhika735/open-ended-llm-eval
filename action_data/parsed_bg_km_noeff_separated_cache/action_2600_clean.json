  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of modifying the roadside environment to reduce collisions by reducing attractiveness of road verges to mammals. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\n(1 study): A replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in Canada found that draining roadside salt pools and filling them with rocks reduced the number and duration of moose visits.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCollisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions can be employed to in an attempt to reduce the animal-vehicle collision rate. One option may be to modify the roadside environment to make it less attractive to mammals. This could involve removing vegetation that provides mammals with feeding or shelter resources, planting vegetation that is unattractive to mammals or removing other roadside features that are known to attract mammals and create accident hotspots.\nConover M.R., Pitt W.C., Kessler K.K., DuBow T.J. & Sanborn W.A.
