  "action_title": "Translocate crop raiders away from crops (e.g. elephants) to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of translocating crop-raiding animals away from crops to reduce human-wildlife conflict. One study was in Kenya and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled study in Kenya found that translocated crop-raiding African elephants had a lower survival rate after release than did non-translocated elephants at the same site.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): A study in the USA found that most American black bears translocated from sites of crop damage were not subsequently recaptured at sites of crop damage.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhere wild mammals cause unacceptable damage to crops, they may be translocated from their point of capture and released some distance away. The release site may be an area away from where agricultural crops are grown. The intervention can fail if translocated animals continue to raid crops or if survival of translocated animals is low. If the intervention succeeds, it may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals. Several other interventions cover translocations that are primarily for conservation of rare or threatened species, such as Translocate to re-establish or boost populations in native range."
