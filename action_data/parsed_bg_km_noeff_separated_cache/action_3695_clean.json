  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using conditioned taste aversion on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that a similar number of loggerhead turtle nests were predated in areas of the beach where artificial nests containing unpalatable eggs were deployed (to condition taste aversion) compared to areas with no artificial nests with unpalatable eggs.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConditioned taste aversion involves placing chemicals on or near either real or artificial eggs or nests. The chemicals used may be distasteful or cause sickness or other gastrointestinal discomfort, but at a dose not intended to cause long-term harm to the animal. The intention is to create an association between the eggs and the unpleasant chemical, thereby reducing predation of reptile nests. \nFor other uses of conditioned taste aversion, see Use conditioned taste aversion to prevent carnivorous reptiles from eating toxic invasive cane toads."
