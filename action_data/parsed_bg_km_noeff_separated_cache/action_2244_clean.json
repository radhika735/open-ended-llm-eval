  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of transplanting captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine biogenic habitats are habitats created by the occurrence of a suite of specific marine species that form a new complex environment for other species to live in and can locally promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity. Such habitats include coral reefs, oyster reefs, mussel beds, and kelp forests (Jones et al. 1994). Restoring these habitats where they have been either degraded or lost can be achieved by transplanting new individuals of the biogenic species, for instance from captive-bred or hatchery-reared stock (McCay et al. 2003; Yap 2009). This technique can also be used to create new biogenic habitats where they do not naturally occur (Brumbaugh & Coen 2009). Transplanting biogenic species can promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity by providing additional habitat for species to colonize (Homziak et al. 1982).\nNote that here, data on associate invertebrates are reported, but not on the transplanted species itself, which are reported in “Species management - Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Related evidence from translocating studies of habitat-forming species are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Translocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Other related evidence on biogenic habitat restoration is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore biogenic habitats (other methods)”.\n \nBrumbaugh R.D. & Coen L.D.
