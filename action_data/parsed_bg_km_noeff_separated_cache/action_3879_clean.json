  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One replicated study in the USA reported that the abundance of Karner blue butterflies increased over 2–3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left during prescribed burning. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant, one was less abundant, and two had similar abundance in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left during prescribed burning compared to at sites without unburned areas.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in the USA reported that Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches which were surveyed within oak savannas and prairies managed by burning.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOpen habitats, such as grassland, heathland, peatland and fynbos, require disturbance processes to prevent them undergoing succession to scrub or woodland. One option for preventing succession and opening up areas of habitat is to use prescribed burning. However, burning is likely to be destructive in the short-term, because of either direct mortality or a reduction in food availability for butterflies and moths (Glaves et al. 2013). Leaving some areas unburned within a prescribed burn, in particular habitat patches which currently support a high abundance of sensitive species (Kwilosz & Knutson 1999), may help populations to survive the fire and recolonize the newly created habitat over the following weeks, months or years. Unburned patches may be part of the burning rotation, or remain permanently unburned and managed by other, non-fire management options such as grazing or haying.\nFor studies on the impact of single prescribed burns, see “Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”. For studies of other changes to the burning regime, see “Use rotational burning” and “Change season/timing of prescribed burning”.\nGlaves D.J., Morecroft M., Fitzgibbon C., Lepitt P., Owen M. & Phillips S.
