The study was in Brazil.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nGermination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated study in Brazil found that sowing tree seeds in savanna resulted in germination of 52% of the tree seeds.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in Brazil found that after sowing tree seeds in savanna, 35% of the seeds produced seedlings that survived for more than two years.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSavanna habitats consist of a mixture of grassland and woodland habitats in which trees do not form a closed canopy. Trees are cleared in many savanna areas often to increase the quality of pasture for livestock. Sowing seeds of tree species may help to increase tree abundance."
