  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies from the USA, of 21 studies captured, found that overall species richness did not vary between burned areas, or areas burned recently, and unburned sites. One study found that community composition was also similar whilst others found that species showed individual responses.\nNine studies from across the world found that at least some study species were found at higher densities or were more abundant in burned areas than in unburned areas or areas under different management. One study investigated multiple interventions at once. Fourteen studies found that at least one study species was less abundant or found at similar abundances on burned areas of grassland, compared to unburned areas or those under different management. However, four studies found that apparent responses varied depending on how soon after fires measurements were taken. Care should therefore be taken when interpreting the results of studies on prescribed burning.\nOne study from the USA found that Florida grasshopper sparrow had significantly higher reproductive success soon after plots were burned, whilst another American study founds that dickcissel reproductive success was higher in patch-burned areas than burned and grazed areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSuppression of fires may shift grassland communities from grasses and herbs towards woody-stemmed species. Alternatively, it may allow the fuel load to build up to such an extent that when fires do occur, they are hotter and burn for longer. This can mean that even fire-adapted plants (such as some pines and palms) are killed.\nA possible way to reduce these effects is to ensure there are frequent, smaller fires, which prevent trees from establishing and constantly reduce the fuel load of a system."
