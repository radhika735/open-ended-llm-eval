  "action_title": "Water primrose: Combination treatment using herbicides and physical removal",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA study in California, USA1, found that application of glyphosate and a surface active agent called Cygnet-Plus followed by removal by mechanical means achieved a 75% kill rate of water primrose. \nA study in Australia2, found that a combination of herbicide application, physical removal, and other actions such as promotion of native plants and mulching, reduced the coverage of Peruvian primrose-willow by 85-90%.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nA combination treatment of herbicide application and physical removal offers a tool for localised population reduction, and can be used to prevent significant deoxygenation of the water body due to decomposition of treated plant material.\nNumerous attempts to eradicate water primrose report that a combination treatment is much more effective than chemical treatment alone.  For example, a study in the USA reported that mechanical removal alone had limited effectiveness, whereas a combined glyphosate spray/mechanical removal treatment, though most expensive, gave the most lasting control of water primrose Ludwigia spp. (San Francisco Estuary Institute, et al. 2004).  In support of this, it is reported that large-flower primrose-willow Ludwigia grandiflora was controlled in the Marais Poitevin, France by regular management actions including both mechanical and chemical methods (EPPO 2011).  In addition, it is reported that after a single application of 4.3 kgs glyphosate/ha a population of water primrose Ludwigia spp. almost returned to its initial invasion stage after two years (Dutartre & Oyarzabal 1993; Delbart et al. 2013).\nSan Francisco Estuary Institute (2004) Field evaluations of alternative pest control operations in California waters.
