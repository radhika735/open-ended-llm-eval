  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing crossings over/under pipelines. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nUse (3 studies): A study in USA found that buried pipeline sections were used more frequently than their availability as crossing points by caribou. A study in USA found that pipeline sections elevated specifically to permit mammal crossings underneath were not used by moose or caribou more than were other elevated sections. A controlled study in Canada found that a range of large mammal species used wildlife crossings over pipelines.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPipelines can extend hundreds of kms and may represent substantial barriers to mammal movements if they lie at or just above the surface of the ground. Crossing points can be either elevated sections of pipe with space for mammals to pass beneath, buried sections or sections with crossing ramps constructed over the pipe."
