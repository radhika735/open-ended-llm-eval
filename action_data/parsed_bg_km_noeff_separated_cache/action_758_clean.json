  "action_title": "Remove tree canopy to reduce pond shading",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Denmark found that translocated garlic toads established breeding populations following pond restoration that included canopy removal.\nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that canopy removal did not increase hatching success of spotted salamanders.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nShading of ponds by tree canopies reduces water temperature, affects plant communities and can result in chemical changes resulting from the decomposition of increased leaf litter. Such changes can affect amphibian populations. For example, warm ponds are more favourable for amphibian growth and development.\nStudies in which tree canopies were removed as one of a combination of interventions for the restoration of ponds are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’."
