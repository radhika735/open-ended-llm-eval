  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeventeen studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals into areas with artificial refuges or breeding sites. Five studies were in the USA, three were in Australia, three were in Spain, two were in the UK and one was in each of Ireland, South Africa, Hungary and Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Two of three studies (two replicated, two controlled) in Spain and the USA found that translocation release sites with artificial burrows provided had higher abundances of European rabbits and densities of California ground squirrels compared to those without. The other study found that abundance of European rabbits following translocation was similar with and without artificial burrows provided. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that after translocating black-tailed prairie dogs to areas with artificial burrows, colonies increased in size. A before-and-after study in Spain found that translocating European rabbits into areas with artificial refuges to supplement existing populations did not alter rabbit abundance, although two of three populations persisted for at least three years.\nReproductive success (4 studies): Three studies in Australia, Ireland and the UK found that released captive-bred sugar gliders, most translocated female red squirrels and some translocated pine martens provided with nest boxes and supplementary food reproduced. A study of 12 translocation projects in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland found that translocated European ground squirrels released initially into enclosures or burrows with retention caps reproduced after release, whereas those without enclosures or burrows dispersed from release sites.\nSurvival (9 studies): Five of eight studies in Australia, the USA, UK, Ireland and South Africa found that at release sites with artificial refuges, and in some cases food provided, a population of captive-bred sugar gliders survived at least three years, two of three populations of red-tailed phascogales survived for more than four years, most translocated black bears survived at least one year and over half translocated red squirrels and pine martens survived 8-12 months. Three studies found that at release sites with artificial refuges, food and in one case water provided, no translocated red squirrels survived more than five months, all translocated rock hyraxes died within three months and most translocated Tipton and Heermann’s kangaroo rat spp. died within five days. A randomised, replicated, controlled study in Hungary found that translocated European ground squirrels released into plugged artificial burrows had higher recapture rates than those released into unplugged artificial burrows.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): Two studies in Australia found that released captive-bred sugar gliders used artificial nest boxes provided.\nBehaviour change (1 study): A replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that translocated Utah prairie dogs released into an area with artificial burrows, after the control of native predators, tended to leave the release site and spent more time being vigilant than before.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals that are translocated or captive-bred and released are especially vulnerable immediately after release. At this time, they may struggle to find shelter in an unfamiliar area, or there may be few suitable refuges/breeding sites available in the new area. Furthermore, if the time they spend looking for suitable shelter or breeding sites is increased, this may make them more vulnerable to predation. Hence, providing artificial refuges or breeding sites in the release area may improve longer-term survival and reproductive rates.\nSee also: Habitat restoration and creation - Provide artificial refuges/breeding sites, provide artificial dens or nest boxes on trees, provide more small artificial breeding sites rather than fewer large sites."
