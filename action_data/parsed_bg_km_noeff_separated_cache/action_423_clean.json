  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nAll four studies we captured describe the management of red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in open pine forests in the USA.\nOne small study found an increase in woodpecker population following the removal of southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans, whilst a second found a population increase following squirrel removal, along with other interventions and a third found that reintroductions were  successful when squirrels were controlled.\nA randomised, replicated and controlled before-and-after study found fewer holes were occupied by squirrels following control efforts, but that occupancy by red-cockaded woodpeckers was no higher.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs humans modify ever-increasing amounts of habitat across the world, the number of nesting sites for many species is becoming limited, potentially increasing competition and reducing reproductive output. Two potential solutions are to increase the number of nesting sites (see separate section in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’) or to reduce competition by removing or controlling competitor species (see below)."
