  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of promoting knowledge exchange between fishers to improve good practice on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishers commonly share information through social relationships, and this may lead to increased fishing success (Turner et al. 2014). However, knowledge exchange between fishers could also be used as a tool to help promote sustainable practices, particularly if the central fishers in information-sharing networks can be identified and co-opted to assist managers in the spreading of conservation information (Mbaru & Barnes 2017).\nMbaru E.K. & Barnes M.L. (2017) Key players in conservation diffusion: Using social network analysis to identify critical injection points. Biological Conservation, 210, 222–232.\nTurner R.A.; Polunin N.V.C. & Stead S.M. (2014) Social networks and fishers' behavior: Exploring the links between information flow and fishing success in the Northumberland lobster fishery. Ecology and Society, 19, 38."
