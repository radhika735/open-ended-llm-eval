  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA total of 32 individual studies from the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK looked at the effects on farmland wildlife of reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands. Twenty-two studies found benefits to some or all wildlife groups studied. Eleven studies (including four replicated site comparisons and three reviews) found reduced management intensity on permanent grassland benefited plants. Sixteen studies (including eight site comparisons of which four paired and three reviews) found benefits to some or all invertebrates. Five studies (including two replicated site comparisons, of which one paired, and a review) found positive effects on some or all birds.\nTwenty-one studies from six European countries found no clear effects of reducing management intensity on some or all plants, invertebrates or birds. Seven studies (including two replicated paired site comparisons and a review) found no clear effect on plants. Ten studies (including four site comparisons and one paired site comparison) found mixed or no effects on some or all invertebrates. Two studies (one review, one site comparison) found invertebrate communities on less intensively managed grasslands were distinct from those on intensively managed grasslands. Four studies (including three site comparisons, of which one paired and two replicated) found no clear effects on bird numbers or species richness.\nFive studies from four European countries found negative effects of reducing management intensity on plants, invertebrates or birds. Two studies (one review, one replicated trial) found some plant species were lost under extensive management. Two studies (one paired site comparison) found more invertebrates in grasslands with intensive management. One paired site comparison found fewer wading birds on grasslands with reduced management intensity than on conventionally managed grassland.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReducing the intensity of grassland management involves reducing or stopping the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides and delaying the mowing date until later in the summer. Studies included here have monitored the effects of carrying out two or more of these management interventions at the same time. All the studies included here monitor the effects of a change of grassland management, or of implementing a regime of reduced management intensity for the purpose of nature conservation, such as an agri-environment scheme.\nStudies that only carry out one of these management interventions, rather than several combined, would be included under the relevant separate intervention. See: ‘Reduce inputs in permanent grassland management’, ‘Raise mowing height on grasslands’ and ‘Delay mowing or first grazing date on grasslands’.\nSee also ‘Pay farmers to cover the cost of conservation measures (as in agri-environment schemes)’ for a study that records the decline in species richness on upland hay meadows over time, following introduction of two main agri-environment schemes in the Yorkshire Dales, UK (Pacha and Petit 2008).\nThere is also a literature comparing sites without direct intervention, such as Di Giulio et al. (2001), in which wildlife on species-rich grasslands is compared with wildlife on intensive grasslands. Whilst such studies are relevant, they do not demonstrate the effects of direct intervention (reducing management intensity or imposing a reduced management intensity regime) and as such we do not include them.\nDi Giulio M., Edwards P.J. & Meister E.
