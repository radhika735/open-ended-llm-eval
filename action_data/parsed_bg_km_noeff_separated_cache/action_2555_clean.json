  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of applying water to vegetation to increase food availability during drought. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after study in the USAÂ found that watering scrub during drought increased its use by adult Sonoran pronghorns for feeding.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDrought can cause plants to die as a result of a lack of water. Dieback of vegetation may in turn negatively affect mammal populations by reducing the availability of food. Applying water during a drought may help to reduce some of these negative consequences."
