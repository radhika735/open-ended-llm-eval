  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restricting the sale of problem species in garden centres and pet shops.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany non-native species of plant and animal are sold commercially in garden centres and pet shops. If seeds or individuals of non-native species escape into the wild, they may invade native ecosystems, altering habitat structure or directly competing with, predating or parasitizing native butterflies and moths. Regulating the sale of potentially problematic species may help to reduce the number which are accidentally released, and reduce the chances of an invasion happening."
