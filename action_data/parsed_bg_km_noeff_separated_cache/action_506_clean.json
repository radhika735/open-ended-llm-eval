  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study from Costa Rica found an increase in scarlet macaw Ara macau population following the monitoring of nests, along with several other interventions.\nTwo studies from Puerto Rico and New Zealand found that parrot nest success was higher or mortality reduced or nest success higher with intensive monitoring of nests, ompared to periods without monitoring. A study from New Zealand also found high overall nest success when nests were monitored.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf populations are reduced to extremely low levels and have low reproductive success then extremely intensive monitoring can be used to ‘guard nests’ and protect them from a range of threats through direct intervention. Due to the intensive nature of this work it is only likely to be viable if there are volunteers available to do it, and the population being monitored is very small."
