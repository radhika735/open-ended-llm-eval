  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nÂ \n\nOne study reported that a programme to enhance take-up of stingless beekeeping in southern Mexico increased the number of managed colonies in the area.\nFive trials contributed to scientific improvement of stingless beekeeping methods. Two controlled trials showed that either brewer's yeast (one trial) or a mix with 25% pollen collected by honey bees Apis mellifera (one trial) can be used as a pollen substitute to feed Scaptotrigona postica in times of pollen scarcity. A study on the island of Tobago found a wooden hive design with separate, different-shaped honey and brood chambers allowed honey to be extracted without damaging the brood. One trial showed that 50 g of comb with mature pupae is enough to start a new daughter colony of S. mexicana. One trial found brood growth was higher in traditional log hives than in box hives with internal volumes exceeding 14 litres, and recommended smaller box hives.\nWe have captured no clear evidence about whether these activities help conserve bees or enhance native bee populations.",
