  "action_title": "Plant/sow seeds of nurse plants alongside focal plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that sowing seeds of nurse plants and heathland plants did not increase the cover of common heather. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds of nurse plants and California sagebrush seeds together reduced survival of shrubs in more than half of cases. The same study found that California sagebrush biomass was also reduced when its seeds were sown with those of nurse plants.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNurse plants are plants which are thought to aid the growth of other species by providing relatively benign conditions below their canopy. Examples of these altered conditions may include increases in moisture and nutrients, and decreases in temperature and damage from herbivores (de Toledo Castanho & Prado 2014). Combining the planting or sowing of seeds of nurse plants with that of focal plants may help to increase focal plant survival and growth.\nde Toledo Castanho, C. and P. I. Prado (2014). \"Benefit of shading by nurse plant does not change along a stress gradient in a coastal dune.\" PLOS ONE 9(8): e105082."
