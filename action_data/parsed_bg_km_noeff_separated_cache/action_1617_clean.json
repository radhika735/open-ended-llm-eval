  "action_id": "1617",
  "action_title": "Maintain habitat corridors over or under roads and other transportation corridors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of maintaining habitat corridors over or under roads and other transportation corridors on shrublands.\n\n'We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe maintenance of habitat corridors in areas with widespread human land use has been suggested as a method to retain connectivity between sites (Beier and Noss, 1998). This connectivity may help to maintain interactions between plant and animals such as pollination and seed dispersal, which can aid survival of plant populations and increase plant diversity.\n \nBeier, P., & Noss, R. F. (1998). Do habitat corridors provide connectivity? Conservation Biology, 12(6), 1241-1252."
