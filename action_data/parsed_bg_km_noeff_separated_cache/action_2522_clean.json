  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of modifying culverts to make them more accessible to mammals. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that modified culverts (with a dry walkway, open-air central section and enlarged entrances) were used more by bobcats to make crossings than were unmodified culverts.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCulverts under roads may be used as crossing routes by mammals. This use reduces collision-associated risks to mammals and to motorists compared with crossings over the road surface. Some culverts may be less suited as crossing routes than others. For example, culverts with water flowing across their entire width may not be used by some mammals whilst tunnel length may also be a barrier to their use. A range of modifications can be made to try to increase culvert suitability for use by wild mammals."
