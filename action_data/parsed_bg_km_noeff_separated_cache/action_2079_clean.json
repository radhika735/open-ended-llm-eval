  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number and/or extent of, or prohibit additional, renewable energy installations in an area on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through damages to the seabed, pollution, or spread of non-native species (Wu et al. 1994). Some of these threats are also commonly associated with other anthropogenic activities or infrastructures, such as oil rigs and wind farms (Gimpel et al. 2015; Inger et al. 2009). By co-locating aquaculture systems with these activities and infrastructure, the cumulative negative impacts can be spatially limited and constrained in extent, therefore potentially preventing their occurrence elsewhere, or allowing recovery in the case of relocation. Marine spatial planning can help with identifying suitable area for the occurrence of multiple complex activities (Douvere 2008; Inger et al. 2009). Evidence for interventions related to aquaculture relocation are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate aquaculture systems in already impacted areas”, “Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to act as biofilters”, and “Habitat restoration and creation – Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient run-offs”.\n \nDouvere F.
