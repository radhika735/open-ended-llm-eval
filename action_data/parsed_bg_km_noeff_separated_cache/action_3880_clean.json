  "action_title": "Use fire suppression/control",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using fire suppression or control on butterflies and moths.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWildfires are part of a natural disturbance process in many habitats, and help to retain open landscapes such as grasslands and savannas. However, fire is destructive, and in the short-term will destroy habitat and kill butterflies and moths (Glaves et al. 2013). In areas occupied by sensitive and range-restricted species, it may therefore be necessary to suppress or control fires – whether natural or anthropogenic – to reduce their impact to small areas. This may be achieved by using herbicides or manual vegetation clearance to reduce the fuel-load in fire-prone areas, or deliberately burning small areas to reduce the risk of large wildfires.\nFor studies on creating fire breaks to restrict the spread of wildfires, see “Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation to create fire breaks”.\nGlaves D.J., Morecroft M., Fitzgibbon C., Lepitt P., Owen M. & Phillips S.
