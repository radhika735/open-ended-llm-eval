  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOf 23 studies found, three from the USA, Canada and Iceland found that species richness on restored grassland sites was similar to remnant habitats or higher than unrestored sites. One replicated, randomised study from the USA found that bird diversity was lower on restored grassland sites compared to hayfields or pastures, whilst a small American study found that species richness declined at one of two fields restored to grassland from croplands. Three studies from the USA found that target species used restored grasslands.\nTwo studies from the USA found that CRP fields held disproportionate proportions of total bird populations, or that local population trends were correlated with the amount of CRP land in the area. Six studies from the USA and UK found that the abundances or densities of some, or all, species were higher on restored sites compared to unrestored sites, or were comparable to natural habitats. Two studies found lower abundances of species on restored sites compared to unrestored sites, although the authors of one suggest that drought conditions may have confounded the results.\nFive studies from the USA found that at least some bird species in restored areas of grassland had higher productivities than birds in unrestored areas; similar or higher productivies than natural habitats; or had high enough productivities to sustain populations. Three studies found that productivities were lower in restored areas than unrestored, or that productivities on restored sites were too low to sustain populations.\nA replicated study from the USA found that older CRP fields held more nests, but fewer species than young fields. Two replicated American studies found no differences in species richness or abundances between CRP fields and riparian filter strips whether they were sown with warm- or cool-season grasses, whilst another found that more grassland specialist species were found on sites sown with non-native species. A replicated study from the USA found no difference in bird densities between sites seeded with redtop grass and those not seeded. A study from Iceland found that very few birds were found on restored sites, unless they were sown with Nootka lupin.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral agri-environment schemes including the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) arable reversion scheme (England and Wales), The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in USA, and Permanent Cover Program (PCP) in Canada, provided financial incentives to landowners for planting grass/legume cover as an alternative to annual crops. Primary or secondary objectives of the schemes were to provide habitat for nature conservation purposes.\nThis section describes the results from studies examining the restoration or creation of semi-natural or natural grasslands, but not of permanent artificial pastureland. For example, North American prairies and species-rich chalk grasslands in Europe are both discussed below, but the creation of wet grazing pasture in northern Europe is instead discussed in ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’."
