  "action_title": "Erect fencing to exclude reptiles from construction zones",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of erecting fencing to exclude reptiles from construction zones.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding temporary fencing around construction sites may help to prevent reptiles from entering (or re-entering where individuals have been moved out of the site) such sites. Fencing might also border or surround important reptile habitat and habitat features (e.g. wetlands, nesting sites, talus slopes, areas of woody debris) adjacent to or within construction sites, thereby providing protection during construction periods."
