  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects of installing overpasses over roads/railways on reptile populations. Three studies were in Spain, one was a review of studies in Australia, Europe and North America and one study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that the composition of reptile species on a vegetated overpass was more similar to woodland on one side of the overpass than the other.\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that a vegetated overpass was colonised by two reptile species each year over five years.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOccupancy/range (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that a vegetated overpass was colonized by 14 of 23 native reptile species and one non-native reptile species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): Three of four studies (including two replicated studies and one review) in Spain and Australia, Europe and North America found that overpasses not designed for wildlife were used by lizards and snakes and reptiles. The other study found that overpasses not designed for wildlife were not used by snakes or lizards. Two replicated studies in Spain found that wildlife overpasses were used by lizards and Ophidians (snakes and legless lizards), and one review in Australia, Europe and North America found that one of 10 wildlife overpasses were used by reptiles. One review of road crossing structures in Australia, Europe and North America found that a rope bridge was not used by reptiles.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTo mitigate the effects of roads on wildlife vegetated, vehicle-free overpasses may be constructed. These tend to be constructed for mammals but could also be designed for or used by reptiles.\nWildlife overpasses are constructed to provide safe road and rail crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different structures can be used as overpasses including purpose-built “green bridges”, on which natural vegetation is established, through to general purpose crossing structures that are accessible to both wildlife and vehicles. Overpasses are often used in combination with wildlife barriers that prevent animals accessing the road and which funnel animals toward the overpasses (see Install barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways). Studies summarized within this intervention cover both overpasses created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes but where information about use of such structures by reptiles is included. Studies mostly report on the use of such structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.\nSee also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads/railways."
