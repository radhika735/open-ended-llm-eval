  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using shielded “full cut-off” lights to remove outwards lighting. This study was in Slovenia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in Slovenia found that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to lights fitted with blinds to prevent light scattering (along with filters to remove shorter wavelengths) than to conventional lights without blinds or filters.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths. Although some lighting is necessary for human activity and safety, conventional designs allow light to “spill” outwards from the direction in which the light is required, increasing pollution across a larger area. Changing the design of lights to reduce the amount of light which spills outwards (‘full cut-off’ lighting) may minimize the impact of lights on moths (Gaston et al. 2012).\nGaston K.J., Davies T.W., Bennie J., Hopkins J.
