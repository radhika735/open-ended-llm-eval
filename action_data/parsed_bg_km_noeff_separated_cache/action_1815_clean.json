  "action_title": "Stabilize peatland surface to help plants colonize",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of stabilizing the peatland surface (without planting) on peatland vegetation. The study was in a bog.\nVegetation cover (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in the UKÂ found that pegging coconut fibre rolls onto almost-bare peat did not affect the development of vegetation cover (total, mosses, shrubs or cottongrasses).",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeatland plants may struggle to colonize loose bare peat. Seeds, spores or young plants can be washed or blown away. The peatland surface could be stabilized by pegging fibre netting (e.g. geojute) into the peat or applying fibre rolls to act as wind/water breaks. If made of organic material, these stabilizing aids should degrade once peatland vegetation has colonized.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: cover peat with mulch or other material, which may stabilize the peat surface as well as controlling the microclimate."
