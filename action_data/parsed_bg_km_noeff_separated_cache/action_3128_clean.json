  "action_title": "Introduce organisms to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing organisms (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA. It involved introducing plants to compete with problematic plants.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in canarygrass-invaded wet meadows in the USA found that plots planted with upland vegetation (after mowing and applying herbicide) had greater overall plant species richness than untreated plots, after 1–3 growing seasons.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nNative/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in canarygrass-invaded wet meadows in the USA found that plots planted with upland vegetation (after mowing and applying herbicide) typically had greater cover of unplanted native vegetation than untreated plots, after 1–3 growing seasons.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves biological control: managing the abundance or distribution of problematic organisms via their enemies. Enemies of problematic plants could be disease-causing microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects, fish or even other plants (to compete with or parasitize problematic plants). Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002). Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016), and could damage non-target plants or restrict their establishment (Iannone & Galatowitsch 2008). Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have successfully introduced a biocontrol agent that persisted in the environment. The agent must have been introduced with a clear aim to control problematic plants.\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Use grazing to control problematic plants.\nIannone B.V. III & Galatowitsch S.M.
