  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that the abundance of squirrel tree frogs and green tree frogs increased after removal of invasive Cuban tree frogs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasive amphibians such as Cuban tree frogs Osteopilus septentrionalis can have significant impacts on native amphibian species if they compete for resources. For example, a study found that survival and growth rates of tadpoles of the dominant native species, southern toad Bufo terrestris, decreased significantly in the presence of Cuban tree frog tadpoles and that the invasive tadpoles became dominant (Smith 2006). The same study found that the effects of Cuban tree frogs on southern toads were reduced if predatory eastern newts were also present.\nSmith K.G. (2006) Keystone predators (eastern newts, Notopthalmus viridescens) reduce the impacts of an aquatic invasive species. Oecologia, 148, 342â€“349."
