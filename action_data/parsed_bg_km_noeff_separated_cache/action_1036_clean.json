  "action_title": "<i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Add chemicals to the water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in Italy found that red swamp crayfish could be killed using the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, but that application to drained crayfish burrows was not effective.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAdding chemical toxicants to the water offers the potential for localised control of invasive crayfishes. Chemical ‘dips’ for fishing and sampling gear can also be an effective biosecurity method for preventing the transport of crayfish plague.  Most chemicals will have an impact on non-target organisms, and so their use must be carefully considered before being dosed. In many instances, the use of chemicals may be subject to local or national approval by regulatory authorities. Two before and after studies from Norway (Sandodden & Johnsen 2010) and Scotland (Peay et al. 2006) demonstrated that the biocides cypermethin and pyblast, respectively, were both effective at eradicating a different species of invasive crayfish, signal crayfish. A further study using chlorinated lime was ineffective at controlling signal crayfish in the Czech Republic (Zozak & Policar 2002).\nSandodden, R., & Johnsen, S. I.
