  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of fitting one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study took place in the Corindi River system (Australia).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Corindi River system found that traps fitted with escape frames appeared to reduce the proportion of unwanted undersized mud crabs caught, compared to conventional traps without escape frames.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTraps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). To try to minimise the amount of unwanted catch from this type of fishing, a device such as a rigid frame or rigid wires can be fitted to the entrance of the trap, or other types of “excluder devices” can be used, to reduce the likelihood of unwanted species entering, but also to allow small unwanted species to escape (Broadhurst et al. 2014). Such devices have been effective in reducing accidental catches of seabirds (Morris et al. 2011), seals (Königson et al. 2015), and terrapins (Roosenburg & Green 2000), and therefore may be considered when trying to reduce unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrate species.\nEvidence related to the use of other “bycatch reduction devices”/“excluder devices” on pots and traps are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Fit one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps”.\n \nBroadhurst M.K., Butcher P.A. & Cullis B.R.
