  "action_title": "Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInorganic fertilizer can provide nutrients that are in short supply, thereby increasing the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants. Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K). Fertilizer is usually added immediately before or immediately after planting. It may be sensible to add fertilizer when the focal site is not flooded, to reduce the risk of it dissolving or being washed away.\nThe effects of this action may be heavily dependent on the study context, especially initial site nutrient levels, the amount of fertilizer added, and when it is added. Adding fertilizer when nutrients are already abundant in a site could cause more harm than good, encouraging the growth of undesirable plants or algae and even inhibiting plant growth (Weinbaum et al. 1992).\nRelated actions: Add inorganic fertilizer, other than to complement planting.\nWeinbaum S.A., Johnson R.S. & DeJong T.M.
