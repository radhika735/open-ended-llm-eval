  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of using low intensity lighting on reptile populations. Three studies were in the USA1-3 and one was in Malaysia4.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (4 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the USA1 found that reducing the intensity of light sources did not improve loggerhead turtle hatchling seaward orientation. One replicated, site comparison study in Malaysia4 found that green turtle hatchlings in low and moderate ambient artificial light took more direct crawl routes to the sea than hatchlings released in high ambient artificial light. One replicated, controlled study in the USA3 found that in laboratory trials, loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings showed reduced preference for lower intensity light sources. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA2 found mixed effects of embedding streetlights in the road on seaward orientation of loggerhead turtle hatchlings compared to overhead lighting depending on shading by shrubs and weather and lunar phase.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSea turtle hatchlings generally orient away from high silhouettes (dunes, trees) and towards brighter, lower horizons (light reflecting on the ocean). Artificial light is generally brighter than natural light from the moon and stars and not scattered by the atmosphere and thus interferes with the sea-orienting behaviours of sea turtle hatchlings. Using lower intensity lighting may mitigate some of the impact of increased levels of ambient artificial light near to nesting beaches.\nSee also: Change the colour (spectral composition) of lighting."
