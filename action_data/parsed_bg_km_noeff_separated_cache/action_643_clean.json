  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA controlled study in Finland found that creating clover leys resulted in higher spider abundance and fewer pest insects than a barley control plot. A study in the UK found that one-year ley plots had significantly lower earthworm species richness and abundance than three-and-a-half-year leys. \nA replicated study in the UK found that grass leys had fewer plant species than nine other conservation measures.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention can be established on arable land by under-sowing spring cereal and leaving the under-sown sward to develop the following year. It can also be established through other means. The results of the intervention are monitored on the grass/clover ley.\nSee also ‘Undersow spring cereals, with clover for example’."
