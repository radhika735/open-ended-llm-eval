  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using bubble curtains or screens to dampen underwater noise emissions. The study was in the North Sea (Germany).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that using bubble curtains or screens during pile driving resulted in harbour porpoise detections within 15 km decreasing less compared to before pile driving than at sites without bubble curtains or screens.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nActivities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving, dredging, explosives and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). Various methods may be used to dampen underwater noise emissions. This may involve surrounding the sound source with devices to absorb energy, such as screens or physical barriers, bubble curtains (a ‘curtain’ of air bubbles), hydro-sound dampeners (nets with gas-filled balloons and foam attached), cofferdams (insulated sleeves) or a combination of these measures (Verfuss 2014).\nSee also Use methods to reduce sediment disturbance during dredging (e.g. curtains, screens).\nBailey H., Senior B., Simmons D., Rusin J., Picken G. & Thompson P.M.
