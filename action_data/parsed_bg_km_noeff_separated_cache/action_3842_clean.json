  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of planting parks and gardens with appropriate native species. Seven were in the USA and one was in Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including three paired, three controlled and two site comparison studies) in Germany and the USA found that gardens and road verges planted with native species had a greater species richness of butterfly and moth adults and caterpillars than gardens or verges with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. The other two studies found that the species richness of adult butterflies was similar in areas planted with native or non-native flowers.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (4 studies): Two of three replicated studies (including two paired and two controlled studies) in the USA found that gardens planted with native species had a higher abundance of butterfly and moth caterpillars than gardens with mixed or exclusively non-native plant species. The third study found that the abundance of adult butterflies was similar in areas planted with native or non-native flowers. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that when taller native milkweed species were planted, they had a higher abundance of monarch butterfly eggs and caterpillars than shorter milkweed species.\nSurvival (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that the survival of pipevine swallowtail eggs and caterpillars was lower on California pipevine planted in gardens than in natural sites. The other study found that the survival of monarch butterfly caterpillars was similar on common milkweed planted in gardens and meadows.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that the growth of monarch butterfly caterpillars was similar on eight different native milkweed species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that monarch butterfly adults used common milkweed planted in gardens more than milkweed planted in meadows. The other study found that pipevine swallowtail adults used California pipevine planted in gardens less than in natural sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native ornamental plants dominate urban and suburban landscapes. A large number of butterflies and moths have specialist feeding requirements, and can only feed as caterpillars, or occasionally adults, on plants which they have evolved with (Burghardt et al. 2008). Therefore, butterfly and moth species richness often correlates with the number of potential larval host plant species present in urban parks (Koh & Sodhi 2004), and planting more native species may benefit a wide range of butterflies and moths. Moreover, caterpillar growth and survival can vary between different host plant species (Pocius et al. 2017), so the choice of host species for planting may be important.\nNote that some non-native plants may still provide important nectar resources for butterflies and moths. For studies which include deliberate planting of non-native species, see “Practise ‘wildlife gardening’”.\nBurghardt K.T., Tallamy D.W. & Shriver W.G.
