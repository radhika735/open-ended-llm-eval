  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of recovering lost fishing gear on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing is an important source of marine litter (Gall & Thompson 2015; Matsuoka et al. 2005). Once in the marine environment, discarded or lost fishing gears, often referred to as ‘ghost fishing’ (Matsuoka et al. 2005), can accumulate and subsist for a long time due to very slow degradation. There, it can harm subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, entanglement, smothering and habitat modification (Gall & Thompson 2015; Gilardi et al. 2010). ‘Ghost fishing’ gear, once located, can be recovered and removed from the marine environment, which can reduce the risk of subtidal benthic invertebrates getting caught or harmed (Gilardi et al. 2010).\nEvidence for interventions related to pollution from fishing gear are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use biodegradable panels in fishing pots”. Evidence for other interventions related to the removal of solid litter from the marine environment are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Remove litter from the marine environment” and “Remove and clean-up shoreline waste disposal sites”.\n \nGall S.C. & Thompson R.C.
