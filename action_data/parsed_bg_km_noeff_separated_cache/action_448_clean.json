  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies from South Africa and Australia found high survival of rehabilitated penguins and plovers or similar survival to un-oiled birds. However a large study from the USA and Canada found that rehabilitated common guillemots Uria aalge had significantly lower survival than untreated birds.\nThree studies from South Africa and Australia found that rehabilitated birds bred, with one finding that rehabilitated birds had similar breeding success to un-oiled birds. However, this study found that birds rehabilitated after a second spill were less likely to breed, whilst two other studies found that rehabilitated birds had lower success than un-oiled birds.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOil spills at sea can kill large numbers of seabirds and have the potential to wipe out entire populations where these are small or localised. Oil can stick to birds’ feathers, making them lose their water-proofing and potentially leading to hypothermia. When birds try to clean their feathers they ingest oil and are likely to become poisoned.\nBirds can be taken in and cleaned, but this is an expensive operation, with the cleaning operations after the Treasure oil spill in South Africa in 2000 costing an estimated $100/bird (Whittington 2003). In addition, whereas cleaning may prevent adults from dying, there is evidence that the offspring of rehabilitated birds have lower survival than normal (Barham et al. 2008). This means that the hand-rearing of offspring may be an important intervention after oil spills (Barham et al. 2008, see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’).\nIn addition to the direct effects described in the studies below, one study (Ryan 2003) estimated that the population of African penguins Spheniscus demersus was 19% larger than it would have been without rehabilitation efforts (approximately 163,000 adults, compared to 137,000).\nBarham, P.J., Underhill, L.G., Crawford, R.J.M. & Leshoro, T.M.
