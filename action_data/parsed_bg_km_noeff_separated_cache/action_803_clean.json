  "action_id": "803",
  "action_title": "Augment ponds with ground water to reduce acidification",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of augmenting ponds with ground water to reduce acidification effects on amphibian populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDisturbance of soils during land clearing or development can result in release of salts and therefore water with a low pH. This acidic water can end up in water bodies and have significant effects on aquatic biodiversity including amphibians. Adding uncontaminated ground water to ponds can help to regulate the pH of the water.\nStudies that investigated regulating water levels of ponds are discussed in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications – Regulate water levels’."
