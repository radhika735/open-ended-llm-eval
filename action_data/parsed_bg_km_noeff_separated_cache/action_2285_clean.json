  "action_title": "Restore and manage abandoned orchards for bats",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of restoring and managing abandoned orchards for bats on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRestoring and managing traditional orchards (e.g. by pruning and removing undergrowth) may provide a suitable habitat for foraging and roosting bats. For example, a study in Switzerland found more bat species and greater bat foraging activity in traditionally managed sweet chestnut Castanea sativa orchards with a more open structure than in abandoned and unmanaged orchards that had become overgrown with dense vegetation (Obrist et al. 2011).\nObrist M.K., Rathey E., Bontadina F., Martinoli A., Conedera M., Christe P. & Moretti M. (2011) Response of bat species to sylvo-pastoral abandonment. Forest Ecology and Management, 261, 789–798."
