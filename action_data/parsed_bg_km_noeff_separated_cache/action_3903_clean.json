  "action_title": "Restrict use of polarized light",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restricting the use of polarized light.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths, and some species of moth have been shown to respond to polarized light more than to non-polarized light of the same intensity (Danthanarayana & Dashper 1986), because their eyes are particularly sensitive to polarized light (Belušič et al. 2017). Therefore, restricting the use of polarized light may reduce the impact of artificial lighting on moth populations.\nBelušič G., Šporar K. & Meglič A.
