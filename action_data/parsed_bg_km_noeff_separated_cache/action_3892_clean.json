  "action_id": "3892",
  "action_title": "Introduce legislation to control the use of hazardous substances",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of introducing legislation to control the use of hazardous substances.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPotentially hazardous substances, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers, are sold commercially for use in agriculture as well as privately. This facilitates widespread use over a large area which, even if low level or infrequent, can harm or kill butterflies and moths, and may have contributed to population declines (Gilburn et al. 2015). Using legislation to restrict the sale and application of the most dangerous chemicals could reduce their use, and help threatened butterfly and moth populations to recover.\nGilburn A.S., Bunnefeld N., Wilson J.M., Botham M.S., Brereton T.M., Fox R. & Goulson D. (2015) Are neonicotinoid insecticides driving declines of widespread butterflies? PeerJ 3:e1402."
