  "action_title": "Use artificial barriers to block pollution",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh or swamp vegetation, of using artificial barriers to block out pollution.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial barriers such as sand bags, rocks, temporary berms, bundles of sticks, plastic curtains, booms, absorbent matting or ditches could be used to block out pollution from a focal marsh or swamp. Barriers can isolate pollution and prevent it reaching the site at all, or slow it down so it has time to break down before reaching the focal site. Barriers are likely to be most effective as a short-term intervention to extreme pollution events e.g. oil or chemical spills (Hoff & Michel 2014). In 2010, over 20 km of sand berms were built to protect coastal marshes in Louisiana from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Martínez et al. 2012). In Australia, temporary banks or flow regulators are used to contain the acid water and toxic metals released when acid sulfate soils are rewetted (Baldwin 2011).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have evaluated the effect of barriers on marsh or swamp vegetation – not just the effectiveness of barriers for isolating pollutants.\nRelated actions: Retain/restore/create vegetation around focal site (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Add clean water to reduce pollution.\nBaldwin D.
