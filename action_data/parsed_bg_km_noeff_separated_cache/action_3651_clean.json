  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFourteen studies evaluated the effects of using prescribed burning in grassland and shrubland on reptile populations. Seven studies were in the USA, four were in Australia and one was in each of South Africa, Argentina and France.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that reptile species composition was different before and immediately after burning in three grass types and remained different after vegetation grew back in one of three grass types.\nRichness/diversity (5 studies): Two of three studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in South Africa, Argentina and the USA found that areas with annual burning had similar reptile species richness and diversity compared to unburned areas or that richness was similar across areas with a range of burn frequencies. The other study found that burned areas had higher reptile species richness than unburned areas. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that areas burned 1–4 years earlier had lower reptile species richness than areas burned 11–15 years earlier. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that areas with different burn frequencies had similar reptile species richness and diversity.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (11 studies): Three of six studies (including three replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in the USA and Argentina found that burned areas had a similar abundance of lizards, snakes and lizards and combined reptiles and amphibians compared to unburned areas. Two studies found that burning had mixed effects on the abundance of different reptile species and western yellow-bellied racer snakes.The other study found that burned areas had more eastern massasauga rattlesnakes than unburned areas. One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that areas burned 1–4 years earlier had a lower abundance of reptiles than areas burned 11–15 years earlier. One controlled before-and-after study in the USA found that a burned area had a similar number of four snake species compared to when the area was managed by mowing. One site comparison study in France found that one reptile species was less abundant in areas managed by burning than areas grazed by sheep, whereas the abundance of five other species was similar in all areas. One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that immediately after burning, the abundance of reptiles was lower than before burning, but was similar after vegetation grew back. One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in Australia found that small-scale patch burning was associated with increased abundance of sand goanna burrows.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that some rocky outcrops that were burned were recolonized by pink-tailed worm-lizards.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone, and others have been shaped by long-term use of prescribed burning (Bowman 1998). Prescribed burns are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging, ‘wildfires’. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires that have been suppressed through management or with the expressed purpose of enhancing wildlife habitat (Russell et al. 1999). Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, the intensity of the fire may influence the response of reptiles to the prescribed burn–low-intensity fires may reduce shelters and prey availability while high-intensity fires may increase prey food items but reduce over wintering sites (Pearson et al. 2005). The impact of prescribed burning on habitats and their associated reptile populations are likely to vary depending on whether the vegetation is dominated by woody species, or by grasses and other herbaceous plants. As such, the impact of prescribed burning on reptile populations may vary in different habitats.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by habitat type. See here for: Forest, open woodland & savanna or Wetland.\nFor studies that assess the affect of burning in combination with other actions see Use prescribed burning in combination with vegetation cutting; Use prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application and Use prescribed burning in combination with grazing.\nBowman D.M.J.S.
