  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA controlled laboratory study from the UKÂ found that lowering the pH of water did not kill invasive killer shrimp.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMaking the water more acidic (lowering the pH) through the use of chemicals may kill gammarid shrimps because their exoskeletons are likely to be dissolved by the acid. Prolonged exposure to acidic water may affect the ability of the shrimps to lay down new exoskeletons and to moult."
