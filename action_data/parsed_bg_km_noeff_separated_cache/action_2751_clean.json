  "action_title": "Use acoustic devices at cooling water intake structures",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using acoustic devices at cooling water intake structures on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine or freshwater mammals may enter or be drawn into the cooling water intake structures of power plants, which may result in injury or death. Acoustic devices may be used to deter mammals from approaching intake tunnels. However, it should be noted that high amplitude acoustic devices may cause hearing damage to target and non-target mammal species, and may disrupt biologically important behaviour or exclude mammals from important habitats (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002, Götz & Janik 2013).\nFor a similar intervention, see Use acoustic devices at renewable energy sites.\nGötz T. & Janik V.M.
