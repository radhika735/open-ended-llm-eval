  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of freshwater wetlands – of soaking them before planting. The study was in a greenhouse in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nBiomass/plant (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that soaking black willow Salix nigra cuttings before planting had no significant effect on the above-ground biomass of surviving seedlings, over the 48 days after planting.\n\nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that the effect, on survival, of soaking black willow cuttings before planting depended on the water regime after planting. However, all cuttings soaked for 15 days before planting died within 42 days of planting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoaking vegetation before planting might increase tissue water content, promote root growth and increase survival after planting (Pezeshki et al. 2005). An abundance of roots might help the planted vegetation to take up enough water during dry periods. Adventitious roots may grow from the stem, near the water line, and help with oxygen uptake if the site is flooded or saturated (Havens 1996). Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of soaked and unsoaked plants. Studies that simply report the performance of pruned plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nRelated actions: Soak seeds before sowing.\nHavens K.J.
