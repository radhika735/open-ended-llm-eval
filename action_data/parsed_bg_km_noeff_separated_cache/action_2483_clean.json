  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing trees and shrubs to recreate open areas of land. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A controlled study in the USAÂ found that where Ashe juniper trees were removed, there were higher abundances of three rodent species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA found that removing trees increased use of areas by Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThrough fire suppression, some forest areas have spread onto previously open ground or have developed denser understorey vegetation than was the case under natural fire regimes. To reduce fuel loads and restore more open habitats for mammalian herbivores, trees and shrubs may be removed. Specifically, this intervention includes studies where the intention is to recreate open areas on land onto which forest and scrub has spread.\nFor interventions that remove just limited vegetation layers within forests, or reduce tree density but leave forest cover, see Remove mid-storey vegetation in forest, Remove understorey vegetation in forest and Thin trees to reduce wildfire risk. For interventions looking to benefit mammals through management of longer-established forest, especially where these are carried out through timber harvesting operations, see Biological Resource Use."
