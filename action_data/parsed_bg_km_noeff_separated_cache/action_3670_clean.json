  "action_title": "Armour shorelines to prevent erosion",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of armouring shorelines to prevent erosion on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nShorelines are armoured to prevent shoreline retreat, a natural process where waves erode coastlines. These physical structures range from relatively temporary systems such as sandbags to permanent structures such as rock walls, seawalls, living seawalls and offshore breakwaters. Armouring shorelines may benefit reptiles if it leads to the protection of habitats used by reptiles (e.g. nesting beaches) that would otherwise be lost to erosion."
