  "action_id": "1425",
  "action_title": "Create natural habitat islands within agricultural land",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of creating natural habitat islands within agricultural land on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome primate species, such as the king colobus monkey Colobus polykomos in central Ghana can survive in relatively small forest fragments (Kankam & Sicotte 2012). It is therefore thought that creating or conserving islands covered by natural habitat within agricultural land could enhance the conservation of primate species living in such agroecosystems.\n \nKankam B.O. & Sicotte P.
