  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of providing woody debris in ski run areas. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A controlled study in the USA found that placing woody debris on ski slopes did not affect overall small mammal abundance and had mixed effects on individual species abundances.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSki-runs are traditionally created by removing trees and undergrowth along with removal of tree stumps and reshaping of topsoil by bulldozing (Ries 1996). As a result, they can present barriers to animal movement (Mansergh & Scotts 1989) and reduce animal abundance (Morrison et al. 1995). The provision of woody debris on ski runs may increase use by small mammals.\n \nMansergh I.M. & Scotts D.J.
