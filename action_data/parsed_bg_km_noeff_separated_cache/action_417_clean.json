  "action_title": "Use supplementary feeding to reduce predation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA controlled cross-over experiment from the UK found that there was no difference in grouse adult survival or productivity when supplementary food was provided to hen harrier Circus cyaneus compared to in control areas.\nThis study and another from the USA that used artificial nests found that nest predation rates were reduced in areas when supplementary food was provided to predators. A second study from the USA found no such effect.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf predators are dependent on threatened birds then providing supplementary food for the predators may remove some predation pressure whilst also supporting the predator population. However, it is also possible that providing supplementary food will allow an increase in the predator population and therefore increase predation pressure.\nStudies describing the effects of supplementary food on fed populations are described in a separate chapter."
