  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of paying farmers to cover the costs of non-harmful strategies to deter primates on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBy paying farmers to cover their costs for implementing strategies to deter primates from their crops, farmers may be more tolerant towards crop-raiding primates and less likely to kill them.\n            Schemes to compensate for the farmer’s produce loss incurred by crop-raiding primates are discussed under ‘Compensate farmers for produce loss caused by primates’."
