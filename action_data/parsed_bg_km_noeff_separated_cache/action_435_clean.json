  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA literature review found no compelling evidence that culling mountain hares Lepus timidus (a carrier of the ticks that carry louping ill virus) increased red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus populations.\nA controlled before-and-after study from the UK did find that there was a significant increase in chick production on grouse moors with hare culling, compared to control sites but no change in population density. A comment on this paper argued that the controls used in it were not adequate.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf a bird population is threatened by a parasite or disease that can infect multiple species, it may not be enough to treat the population, because of the risk of constant re-infection from the other host, which can act as a ‘reservoir species’. Instead it may be necessary to treat the other hosts or to exclude them from particular habitats or control their numbers.\nWhile we found studies describing the impact of controlling reservoir species through culling, we found no intervention-based studies describing the impact of excluding reservoir species from an area.  However, a correlative study in Scotland in 2007 found that areas of forest that were fenced to exclude deer had fewer ticks (carriers of louping ill virus which attacks red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus) than unfenced areas, but that areas of adjacent moorland (where the grouse were actually found) were not affected (Ruiz-Fons & Gilbert, 2010).\nRuiz-Fons, F. & Gilbert, L.
