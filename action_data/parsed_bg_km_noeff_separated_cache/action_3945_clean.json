  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of changing mowing regimes on grassland. Two studies were in the USA and one was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\n \nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that mowing coastal grassland in August reduced the abundance of Fisher’s estuarine moth caterpillars, whereas mowing in November or leaving sites unmown did not reduce abundance. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that prairies managed by haying had a higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies, but a lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies, than prairies managed by burning, and the abundance of prairie specialists was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year. One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that the abundance of Karner blue butterflies on oak savannas managed by mowing was similar to unmanaged savannas or savannas managed by burning.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn the absence of wild or domestic grazing animals, mowing or haying can be used to maintain open grasslands or savannas, and prevent scrub encroachment. However, mowing causes a sudden change in the habitat structure, removing nectar plants and potentially injuring or killing eggs, caterpillars or pupae living within the sward (Humbert et al. 2010, Morris 2000). The timing and frequency of mowing may be important for avoiding these short-term negative impacts on butterflies and moths (Morris 2000). This action includes studies comparing different mowing regimes, as well as studies comparing mowing to other options for grassland management, such as burning.\nFor studies on the creation or restoration of grasslands by either multiple actions (which may include mowing) or where the specific action is not clear, see “Restore or create grassland/savannas”. For studies on other actions for grassland management and restoration, see “Natural system modifications – Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”, “Agriculture and aquaculture – Maintain species-rich, semi-natural grassland” and “Agriculture and aquaculture – Restore or create species-rich, semi-natural grassland”. For studies on diversifying mowing regimes on productive grasslands, see “Agriculture and aquaculture – Use rotational mowing” and “Agriculture and aquaculture – Delay cutting or first grazing date on grasslands to create variation in sward height”.\nHumbert J.Y., Ghazoul J., Sauter G.J. & Walter T.
