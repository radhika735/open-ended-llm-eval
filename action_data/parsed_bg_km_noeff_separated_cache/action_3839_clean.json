  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of on butterflies and moths of applying ecological compensation for developments. One was in the USA and the other was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One study in Australia reported that a population of purple copper butterfly caterpillars translocated from a development site to an area of compensatory and retained habitat increased in number over three years.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that an area of lupines transplanted from a development site was used by a similar number of Karner blue butterflies to an area with no transplanted lupines.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDevelopment projects destroy or disturb natural habitats, displacing animals living there. Ecological compensation for developments aims to create new habitat, or improve the condition of existing habitat, outside of the development area, to replace that which is lost (Kleintjes et al. 2003). This intervention tests whether these compensation areas are effective for butterflies and moths.\nKleintjes P.K., Sporrong J.M., Raebel C.A. & Thon S.F.
