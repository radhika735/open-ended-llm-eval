  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of informing local communities and fishers about the negative impacts of hunting to reduce the killing of marine and freshwater mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEducation programmes that emphasize the negative impacts of killing marine and freshwater mammals may reduce hunting pressure. However, there are many factors that influence human behaviour, and it may be necessary to collaborate with social scientists to design appropriate education programs.\nSee also Educate local communities and fishers on mammal protection laws to reduce killing of marine and freshwater mammals."
