  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on non-target mammals of using selective trapping methods in hunting activities.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHunting using traps (such as snares, leg-hold traps or cage traps) can result in capture of rare, threatened or protected non-target species mammal (e.g. Andreasen et al. 2018). Measures to reduce such “bycatch” might include setting a weight-sensitive release catch, placing traps in particular areas (or avoiding other areas) or only using specific baits.\nAndreasen A.M., Stewart K.M., Sedinger J.S., Lackey C.W. & Beckmann J.P. (2018) Survival of cougars caught in non‐target foothold traps and snares. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 82, 906–917."
