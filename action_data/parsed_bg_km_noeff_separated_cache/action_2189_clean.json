  "action_title": "Locate aquaculture systems in vegetated areas",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of locating aquaculture systems in vegetated locations on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Aquaculture systems can be located in areas with submerged vegetation, such as seagrass or kelp, which can help absorb the waste product effluents and mitigate the pollution originating from the installations (Mirto et al. 2010). This may help locally reduce or mitigate the deterioration in water quality in the area and benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates.\nEvidence for other interventions related to the relocation of aquaculture activities are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate aquaculture systems in already impacted areas”, “Locate aquaculture systems in locations with fast currents”, and “Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems (and vice versa) to act as biofilters”.\n \nMirto S., Bianchelli S., Gambi C., Krzelj M., Pusceddu A., Scopa M., Holmer M. & Danovaro R.
