  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntroducing appropriate alternative income-generating activities may reduce the reliance of communities on earning money from collecting/hunting and selling wild animals, and in turn reduce the collecting/hunting pressure on wild populations. Studies in this section should ideally directly test the effect of the intervention on wild populations, as well as the income benefits and participation levels within the communities."
