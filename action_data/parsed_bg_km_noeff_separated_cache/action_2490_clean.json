  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects of restoring former mining sites on mammals. Eleven studies were in Australia and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)\n\nSpecies richness (8 studies): A review in Australia found that seven of 11 studies indicated that rehabilitated areas had lower mammal species richness compared to unmined areas. Four of five replicated, site comparison studies, in Australia, found that mammal species richness was similar in restored mine areas compared to unmined areas or higher in restored areas (but similar when considering only native species). One study found that species richness was lower in restored compared to in unmined areas. A replicated, controlled study in Australia found that thinning trees and burning vegetation as part of mine restoration did not increase small mammal species richness. A replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that restored mine areas were recolonized by a range of mammal species within 10 years.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): A review of rehabilitated mine sites in Australia found that only two of eight studies indicated that rehabilitated areas had equal or higher mammal densities compared to those in unmined areas. One of three replicated, site comparison studies, in the USA and Australia, found that small mammal density was similar on restored mines compared to on unmined land. One study found that for three of four species (including all three native species studied) abundance was lower in restored compared to unmined sites and one study found mixed results, including that abundances of two out of three focal native species were lower in restored compared to unmined sites. A replicated, controlled study in Australia found that thinning trees and burning vegetation as part of mine restoration did not increase small mammal abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): A replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that most restored former mine areas were not used by koalas while another replicated site comparison study in Australia found quokka activity to be similar in revegetated mined sites compared to in unmined forest.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nGenetic diversity (1 study): A site comparison study in Australia found that in forest on restored mine areas, genetic diversity of yellow-footed antechinus was similar to that in unmined forest.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRestoration of former mining sites usually involves establishing native or non-native plants, often with the main aim of reducing erosion or reducing the concentration of pollutants (Wong 2003). However, this restoration may also benefit mammal species found in and around former mining sites by creating habitat conditions similar to those found prior to mining operations.\nWong M.H. (2003) Ecological restoration of mine degraded soils, with emphasis on metal contaminated soils. Chemosphere, 50, 775–780."
