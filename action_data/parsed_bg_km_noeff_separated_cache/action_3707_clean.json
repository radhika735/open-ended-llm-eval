  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of developing/implementing species recovery plans on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nConservation status (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after, paired study in Australia found that the chance of a species’ conservation status improving or being stable was similar for those with a recovery plan (including three reptile species) and those without a plan (including three reptile species).",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSpecies recovery plans are documents that set out the actions for species management. Recovery plans are more likely to be effective when they are tailored to the species at risk, revised regularly to ensure that they are up to date, and incorporate evaluation to enable efficient and effective conservation action (Boersma et al. 2001).\nBoersma P.D., Kareiva P., Fagan W.F., Clark J.A. & Hoekstra J.M. (2001) How Good Are Endangered Species Recovery Plans? BioScience, 51, 643–649."
