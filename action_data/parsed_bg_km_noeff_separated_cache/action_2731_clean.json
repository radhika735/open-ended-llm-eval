  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effect of using an alternative method to commercially harvest plankton on marine fish populations. The study was in the Norwegian Sea (Norway). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (1 study): One controlled study in the Norwegian Sea found that the amount of unwanted fish larvae and eggs in fine-mesh catches of zooplankton were reduced after deployment of a bubble-plume harvester, compared to without deployment.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nZooplankton (tiny drifting organisms) is a valuable source of protein and is harvested in the wild for use as aquaculture feed and pet fish food (Wiborg 1976). Fishing for zooplankton is done using fine-meshed trawls that results in lots of unwanted organisms being caught, including fish eggs and larvae. To help reduce mortality of unwanted fish eggs and larvae, an alternative method of plankton harvesting using air bubbles may enable selective transport in the water column of the targeted zooplankton such as copepods, up towards the surface (bubble flotation method). These can then be harvested by a plankton trawl leaving the fish eggs and larvae untouched at lower depths.\nWiborg K. F. (1976) Fishery and commercial exploitation of Calanus finmarchius in Norway. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 36, 251–258."
