  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Biological control using fungal-based herbicides",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of biological control of parrot’s feather using fungal-based herbicides.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nApplication of a mass-produced product, formulated from fungal microorganisms which cause disease in the host plant, can be used as a means of controlling invasive plants (Gassmann et al. 2006; Hussner et al. 2017). The use of pathogens to control parrot’s feather is discussed under ‘Biological control using plant pathogens’.\n \nGassmann A., Cock M.J.W., Shaw R. & Evans H.C.
