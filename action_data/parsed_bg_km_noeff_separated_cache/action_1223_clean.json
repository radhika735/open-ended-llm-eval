  "action_title": "Use shelterwood harvesting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix of seven studies (including five replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Iran, Nepal and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees. One study found shelterwood harvesting decreased plant species richness and abundance. One study found no effect of shelterwood harvest on tree abundance.\nOne replicated, controlled study in Canada found no effect of shelterwood harvest on red oak acorn production.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nShelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged forests. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuts, with trees removed uniformly over the plot. This allows new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. This can help to maintain distinctive forest species and increase forest structural diversity."
