  "action_title": "Primates: Present food which requires the use (or modification) of tools",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of presenting food to primates that required the use (or modification) of tools. \n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTo be classified as a tool, an object must be held in the hand, foot or mouth by the primate and used to enable him or her to attain an immediate goal (Goodall 1980), such as acquiring food.\nGoodall J (1980) Tool-using in primates and other vertebrates.
