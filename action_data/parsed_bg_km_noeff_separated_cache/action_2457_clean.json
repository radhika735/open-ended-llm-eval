  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of providing diversionary feeding to reduce crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Three studies were in Canada and one was in each of France, Spain and Austria.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (6 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Three of six studies (including four controlled and one before-and-after study) in Canada, France, Spain and Austria found that diversionary feeding reduced damage by red squirrels to pine trees and European rabbits to grape vines, and resulted in fewer red deer using vulnerable forest stands. Two studies found that diversionary feeding did not reduce damage by voles to apple trees or wild boar to grape vines. One study found mixed results on damage by voles to crabapple trees depending on the food provided.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMammals can cause unacceptable losses to farmers, through feeding on crops. If diversionary feeding can reduce the extent to which animals exhibit nuisance behaviour, this may reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control or other intensive management.\nSee also: Provide diversionary feeding to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Residential and commercial development - Provide diversionary feeding for mammals to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict."
