  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies (including two replicated, controlled studies) in the USA found that removing fish by catching them significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs or increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog. One before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years.\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in Sweden found that fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPredatory fish can have negative impacts on amphibian populations, often through direct predation on embryos and larvae. This is particularly the case if the fish are invasive species, often introduced for fishing. For example, a systematic review found that evidence indicates that newts, salamanders and some frog species are less likely to be found in water bodies stocked with salmonids, such as salmon and trout than those with no stocking (Stewart et al. 2007).\nThere is a large amount of literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling fish by catching, which may be undertaken specifically for the conservation of amphibian species (e.g. Knapp et al. 2004).\nKnapp R.A. & Matthews K.R. (2004) Eradication of nonnative fish by gill netting from a small mountain lake in California. Restoration Ecology, 6, 207–213.\nStewart G.B., Bayliss H.R., Showler D.A., Sutherland W.J. & Pullin A.S. (2007) What are the effects of salmonid stocking in lakes on native fish populations and other fauna and flora? Part A: Effects on native biota. Systematic Review No.13. Report."
