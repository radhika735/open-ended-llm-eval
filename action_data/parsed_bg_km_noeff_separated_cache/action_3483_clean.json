  "action_title": "Remove invasive plant species to improve habitat within development footprints",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of removing invasive plant species to improve habitat within development footprints.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGreenfield, brownfield and urban areas are often invaded by weedy species. These potentially valuable habitat areas are subject to disturbances such as introduced exotic species (both plants and animals), fire and accumulation of rubbish. For studies relating to management of invasive plant species, see Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species and Habitat restoration and creation."
