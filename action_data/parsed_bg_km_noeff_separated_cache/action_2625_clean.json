  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrophy hunting is the hunting of wild animals for recreation. Usually, this involves large or otherwise distinguished animals, such as large carnivores, or species with large antlers. The animal, or part of it, is kept by the hunter, often for display. Some trophy hunting provides financial support to local communities or conservation, through locally levied fees (Minin et al. 2016). However, permitting exports of hunting trophies (often from developing countries to developed countries) may provide incentives for hunting at unsustainable levels (Lindsey et al. 2016) or may provide a route for importing illegally hunted trophies. Bans on trophy hunting exports are designed to remove this incentive and, hence, reduce incentives for the hunting of relevant species.\nLindsey P.A., Balme G.A., Funston P.F., Henschel P.H & Hunter L.T.B.
