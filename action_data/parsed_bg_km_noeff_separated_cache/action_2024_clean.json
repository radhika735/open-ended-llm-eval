  "action_id": "2024",
  "action_title": "Adapt bat roost structures to buffer against temperature extremes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of adapting bat roost structures to buffer against temperature extremes on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves is expected to increase with climate change. Adapting bat roost structures to buffer against extreme temperatures could help to protect bats during extreme weather events.\nFor an intervention that aims to maintain the microclimate of artificial roosts, see ‘Manage microclimate of artificial bat roosts’."
