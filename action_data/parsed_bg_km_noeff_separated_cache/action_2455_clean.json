  "action_title": "Establish deviation ponds in fish farms to reduce predation of fish stock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of establishing deviation ponds in fish farms to reduce predation of fish stock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome mammals can become significant predators of fish being reared in fish farms. For example, one study found that rainbow trout Onchorhynchus mykiss from a fish farm formed 87% of biomass of prey consumed by otters Lutra lutra in the vicinity (Marques et al. 2007). Deviation ponds are sites where fish are made easily accessible to predators in order to keep them away from other, more valuable, fish kept elsewhere on the site. If effective, this intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of mammalian predators of fish.\n \nMarques C., Rosalino LM. & Santos-Reis M.
