  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of removing or controlling non-native amphibians.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhilst there are relatively few documented examples of non-native amphibians having direct detrimental impacts on native mammals, the spread of cane toads Bufo marinus in Australia is reported to have accelerated declines in northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus which are poisoned in predation attempts on the toads (Woinarski et al. 2011). A range of methods for controlling cane toads, including biological control, have been proposed (e.g. Shanmuganathan et al. 2010; Ward-Fear et al. 2010).\nShanmuganathan T., Pallister J., Doody S., McCallum H., Robinson T., Sheppard A., Hardy C., Halliday D., Venables D., Voysey R., Strive T., Hinds L. & Hyatt A.
