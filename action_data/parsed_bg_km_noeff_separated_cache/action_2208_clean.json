  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting industrial and urban lighting at night on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial lighting at night, including urban lighting from street lights and houses, industrial lighting from shops and offices, and underwater lighting in marinas and on pontoons, has recently been recognized as a cause for marine environmental concern (Davies et al. 2014). Light pollution has been shown to negatively affect the behaviour of several species, and the community composition of marine invertebrates (Davies et al. 2015; Navarro-Barranco & Hughes 2015). Limiting (in duration, intensity or spectral composition), ceasing or prohibiting lighting at night in an area may reduce the levels of light pollution affecting subtidal benthic invertebrates (Gaston et al. 2012).\n \nDavies T.W., Coleman M., Griffith K.M. & Jenkins S.R.
