  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation by creating new nesting sites on reptile populations. This study was in Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that predation rate of artificial Hermann’s tortoise nests in newly created nesting sites was similar to the predation rate in natural nesting sites.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhen suitable nesting habitat is limited, reptiles may nest at relatively high densities, and clusters of nests are more vulnerable to predation (Marchand & Litvaitis 2003). Increasing the available nesting habitat may reduce predation.\nFor other studies that discuss the effects of creating new nesting sites see Habitat restoration and creation.\nMarchand M.N. & Litvaitis J.A. (2003) Effects of landscape composition, habitat features, and nest distribution on predation rates of simulated turtle nests. Biological Conservation, 117, 243–251."
