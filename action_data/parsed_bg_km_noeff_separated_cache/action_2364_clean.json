  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of placing orphaned or abandoned wild young with captive foster parents. One study was in Canada and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A controlled study in the USA found that stranded sea otter pups reared in captivity by foster mothers had higher post-release survival than did unfostered pups reared mostly alone, and similar survival to wild pups.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\nBehaviour change (2 studies): A study in Canada found that a captive white-tailed deer adopted a wild orphaned fawn. A controlled study in the USA found that stranded sea otter pups reared in captivity by foster mothers began foraging earlier than did unfostered pups reared mostly alone.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nYoung mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. If such mammals can be fostered in captivity by parents of the same species, it may reduce the extent to which they become imprinted on humans and could improve the prospects of post-release survival in the wild. However, the success of such programmes can be difficult to judge, without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.\nSee also Hand-rear orphaned or abandoned young in captivity and Place captive young with captive foster parents."
