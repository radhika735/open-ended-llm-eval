  "action_title": "Use acoustic devices at renewable energy sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using acoustic devices at renewable energy sites on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere is the potential for marine and freshwater mammals to collide with renewable energy devices, such as underwater tidal turbines, or to become entangled in tethering lines and cables (Wilson et al. 2006). Acoustic devices may be used to deter marine or freshwater mammals from entering renewable energy sites. However, it should be noted that high amplitude acoustic devices may cause hearing damage to target and non-target mammal species, and may disrupt biologically important behaviour or exclude mammals from important habitats (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002, Götz & Janik 2013).\nFor a similar intervention, see Use acoustic devices at cooling water intake structures. For the use of acoustic devices during construction activities, such as pile driving, see Use acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure.\nGötz T. & Janik V.M.
