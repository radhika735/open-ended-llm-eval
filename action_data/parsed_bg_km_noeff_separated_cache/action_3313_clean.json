  "action_title": "Add surface mulch before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in Canada.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch after planting wetland herbs typically had no significant effect on total live vegetation biomass, two growing seasons later.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that adding surface mulch increased the cover of one of two planted herb species (creeping alkaligrass Puccinellia phryganodes) but had no significant effect on cover of the other species (estuary sedge Carex subspathacea). Cover was monitored over the second growing season after planting/mulching.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in intertidal brackish marshes in Canada found that adding surface mulch had no significant effect on the survival of two of two planted herb species, after two growing seasons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic mulches (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can be placed on the surface of wetlands to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of planted vegetation. Examples of substances than can be used as mulches include compost, straw, seagrass leaves and seaweed (macroalgae).\nCaution: It may be necessary to sterilize mulch before applying it, with heat or radiation, to kill propagules of undesirable plants. Adding organic matter as a mulch may be less labour intensive than mixing it into the soil or sediment, but increases the risk of the material being washed away.\nRelated actions: Add surface mulch, other than to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting."
