  "action_title": "Introduce a pause when hauling dredge gear",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing a pause when hauling dredge gear on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDredging on the seabed mainly occurs for harvesting of shellfish but can impact fish populations through the fish mortality associated with unwanted catch and discarding. Pausing or stopping the dredge midwater during hauling may reduce unwanted fish catch, particularly flatfish, and decrease fish mortality (Grothues et al. 2017).\nGrothues T.M., Bochenek E.A. & Martin S. (2017) Reducing Discards of Flatfish in the Sea Scallop Dredge Fishery by Dredge Pause. Journal of Shellfish Research, 36, 627–631."
