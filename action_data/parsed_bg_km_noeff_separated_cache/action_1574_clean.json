  "action_title": "Integrate religion/local taboos into conservation education",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of integrating religion/local taboos into conservation education.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the positive influence that taboos may have on primate populations (Colding & Folke 2001, Jones et al. 2008, Jimoh et al. 2012). Religion may also contribute to the protection of particular primate species. For example, Muslims do not generally consume chimpanzee Pan troglodytes/primate meat (East et al. 2005, Costa 2010). This, however, does not necessarily imply that Muslims do not kill primates for example to sell the meat to those who eat it, or to control crop-raiding (Brugiere & Magassouba 2009). This intervention integrates religion/local taboos into conservation education programmes to re-enforce/strengthen local taboos against the killing and consumption of primates.\n \nBrugiere D. & Magassouba B.
