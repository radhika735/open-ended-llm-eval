  "action_id": "1749",
  "action_title": "Restrict vehicle use on peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of restricting vehicle use on peatlands.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVehicles (e.g. cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats) can directly damage peatland vegetation. They can also compress and rut soft, wet peat, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects peatland vegetation. To prevent this damage, vehicle use could be reduced by interventions such as legislation, limits on visitor numbers, voluntary codes, signage and/or ensuring official routes are well maintained.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: use specialized low-impact vehicles to harvest wild biological resources on peatlands; physically exclude vehicles from peatlands; legally protect peatlands."
