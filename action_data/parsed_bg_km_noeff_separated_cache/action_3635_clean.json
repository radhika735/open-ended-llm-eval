  "action_title": "Harvest groups of trees instead of clearcutting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of harvesting groups of trees instead of clearcutting on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nForests naturally undergo disturbances such as storms and lightning that can create open patches. Similarly, harvesting groups of trees rather than clearcutting forest creates a mix of different habitats, allowing a greater range of species to survive in a forest."
