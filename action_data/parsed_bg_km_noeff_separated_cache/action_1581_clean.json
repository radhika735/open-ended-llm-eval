  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of primate populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas of habitat, populations become isolated, which in turn can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Creating/protecting patches of suitable primate habitat (e.g. forest patches) in highly fragmented landscapes may enable them to move between these different areas and help maintain primate populations. Some primate species, such as chimpanzees Pan troglodytes (e.g. McLennan 2008), orangutans Pongo spp. (e.g. Spehar & Rayadin 2017), or samango monkeys Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus (e.g. Nowak et al. 2017) show very high behavioural flexibility enabling them to survive in human-modified landscapes. However, it remains to be seen whether such populations will also survive in the long-term.\n \nMcLennan M.R. (2008) Beleaguered chimpanzees in the agricultural district of Hoima, Western Uganda.
