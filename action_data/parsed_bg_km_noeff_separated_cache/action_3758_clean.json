  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of breeding tuatara in captivity. This study was in New Zealand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One replicated study in New Zealand reported that hatching success of eggs laid in captivity by tuatara was around 50%. The study also found that the first clutches were laid 2â€“8 years after tuatara were brought into captivity.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for other species groups.\nFor studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild."
