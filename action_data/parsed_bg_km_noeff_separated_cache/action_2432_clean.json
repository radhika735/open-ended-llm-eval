  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of disposing of livestock carcasses to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA found that burying or removing sheep carcasses reduced predation on livestock by coyotes, but burning carcasses did not alter livestock predation rates.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLeaving livestock carcasses in place on farms after death may attract mammalian carnivores that may also attack live farm animals. Carcasses can be removed to eliminate this form of attraction for predators. If this results in fewer predators being attracted to farms and, consequently, less predation on livestock, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such predators."
