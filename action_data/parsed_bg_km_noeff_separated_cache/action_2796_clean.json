  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing the duration of time fishing gear is in the water on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReducing the duration of time that fishing gear is in the water (‘soak time’) may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This may include reducing the amount of time that gear is used for active fishing, as well as avoiding leaving static gear in place when not being fished, e.g. to store gear or reserve a fishing patch."
