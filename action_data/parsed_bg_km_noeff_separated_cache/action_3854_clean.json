  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along road or railway verges. Three studies were in the USA and one was in each of Germany, the UK, Finland, Poland, and Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (6 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Germany, the UK, the USA and Finland found that restored roadside prairies, verges sown with native wildflowers, with more butterfly species’ larval food plants, with more species of plants and with more plants in flower had a higher species richness and diversity of butterflies, day-flying moths, burnet moths and meadow-specialist moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation or with fewer butterfly species’ larval food plants, fewer plant species, and fewer plants in flower. However, one of these studies also found that verges sown with more plant species did not have higher species richness of meadow-specialist butterflies. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that road verges and land under power lines managed by mowing once or twice a year, or not at all, had a similar species richness of butterflies to remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that wide road verges had a higher species richness of butterflies than narrow road verges.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the UK, the USA and Finland found that restored roadside prairies and verges sown with more butterfly species’ larval food plants had a greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation or with fewer butterfly species’ larval food plants. However, one of these studies also found that verges with more plants in flower did not have a greater abundance of butterflies and burnet moths than verges with fewer plants in flower. The other study found that verges sown with more plant species did not have a greater abundance of meadow-specialist butterflies or moths. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that road verges and land under power lines managed by mowing once or twice a year, or not at all, had a similar abundance of butterflies to remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that wide road verges had a greater abundance of butterflies than narrow road verges.\nSurvival (3 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA found that restored prairie road verges had a lower mortality risk for butterflies than verges dominated by non-native grasses. The other study found more dead butterflies and moths on roads with tall meadow verges than on roads with frequently mown, non-native, short grass verges or wooded verges. This study also found more dead butterflies and moths on roads with habitat in the central reservation than on roads without habitat in the central reservation. One replicated, site comparison study in Poland found that less frequently mown road verges, and verges mown later in the summer, had fewer dead butterflies than verges which were mown more frequently or earlier in the summer.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that monarch caterpillars living on road verges mown once or twice a year had a similar number of parasites to caterpillars living in mown and unmown prairies.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGrass verges beside transportation corridors may offer an opportunity to provide habitat patches in their own right, as well as to connect larger areas of grassland across the landscape (Munguira & Thomas 1992), although the butterfly community found in remnant habitat along road verges may differ from that found in large blocks of native habitat (Davis et al. 2008). However, roads pose a risk of mortality due to collision with vehicles, a risk which may be higher for smaller species (Skórka et al. 2013). Road verges with more native plant species have a greater abundance and species richness of native butterflies (Skórka et al. 2013, Leston & Koper 2016), although this can also increase the number of butterflies which fly into the road (Zielin et al. 2016). However, the number of individuals killed on the road may be lower next to verges which have a higher species richness of plants (Skórka et al. 2013). This suggests that restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland may provide an opportunity to conserve butterflies and moths along transportation corridors.\nFor studies on reducing collision risk on roads, see “Use infrastructure to reduce vehicle collision risk along roads”.
