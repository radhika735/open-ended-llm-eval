  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nFive studies monitored the effects of the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale, including three replicated site comparisons. Of these, one found an increase in numbers of birds of some species. Two found no effect on the number of bird species or population densities of farmland birds. Three studies found mixed effects, with some species or groups of species increasing and others decreasing.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nAgricultural intensification has resulted in a loss of semi-natural habitats.  These habitats include field margins, ditch banks, hedgerows, woods and ponds. Those that persist support a high proportion of the remaining farmland biodiversity.\nThis intervention is backed up by a body of correlative evidence, which tends to find higher biodiversity or species abundances in areas with higher proportions of semi-natural landscape. For example, in a review looking at the relationship between agricultural biodiversity and semi-natural habitats (Grashof-Bokdam and van Langevelde, 2005),  seven of nine studies found significantly higher spider, bird, plant or butterfly diversity in agricultural landscapes with greater proportions of semi-natural habitat.  The one study on mammal species found no such effect.\nHere we summarize studies in which the proportion of semi-natural habitat in the farmed landscape has been manipulated and responses of wildlife have been monitored. Studies assessing the effects of the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme at a landscape scale are included here. This scheme obliged farmers in Switzerland to manage at least 7 % of their agricultural land area as Ecological Compensation Areas, from 1998 onwards.\nGrashof-Bokdam, C. J. and van Langevelde, F.
