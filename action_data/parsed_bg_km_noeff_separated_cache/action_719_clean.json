  "action_title": "Use crop rotation in potato farming systems",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nPests: Nine studies from Canada and the USA, and one review, investigated the effect of crop rotation on pest or pathogen populations in potato. Three studies (including two replicated studies of which one randomised and one controlled) and a review found crop rotation reduced pest populations and crop diseases in at least one year or at least one site. One paired study (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trial) found pest populations increased in crop rotation. Four studies (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trial) found increases and decreases in pest populations depending on rotation crops used and other treatments. One replicated, randomised, controlled study found no effect. Yield: Three out of five studies (all replicated, controlled, two also randomised) from Canada and the USA, found that crop rotation increased crop yield in some years or with certain rotation crops. The two other studies (both replicated, one also randomised and one replicated) found yield increases and decreases depending on rotation crops used. Profit: One replicated, controlled study found that crop rotation increased profit.Insecticides: Two studies (one replicated, controlled) found that fewer insecticide treatments were needed on rotated plots.\nCrops studied were alfalfa, barley, broccoli, brown mustard, buckwheat, cotton, lupins, maize, oats, pearl millet, peas, potato, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, timothy grass, wheat and yellow sweet clover.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n \nCrop rotation involves alternating between two or more commercial arable crops in successive growing seasons. It may also include ley or fallow periods, as long as at least two crops are involved. Growing different crops each year may help avoid the build-up of crop-specific pests and pathogens.\nThe studies presented for this synopsis are only those that test rotations including potato Solanum tuberosum. We have found approximately 200 further studies on crop rotation in other crop types which will be summarised in the future.\n\nHere we present evidence from 10 of 32 studies testing this intervention for potatoes."
