  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small randomised and controlled trial in the USA found that fed American coots Fulica americana laid heavier eggs, but not larger clutches than controls.\nHowever, a randomised, replicated and controlled study in Canada found that clutch size, but not egg size was larger in fed American coot territories. There was also less variation in clutch size between fed territories.\nThe Canadian study also found that coots laid earlier when fed, whilst a replicated cross-over trial from the UK found three was a shorter interval betweenÂ  common moorhens Gallinula chloropus clutches in fed territories, but that fed birds were no more likely to produce second broods.",
