  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA small from New Zealand found Chatham Island oystercatchers Haematopus chathamensis used raised nest platforms made from car tyres (designed to raise nests above the level of storm surges). The success of these nests is not reported. \nTwo replicated, controlled studies from the USA found that the nesting success of terns and waders was no higher on specially raised areas of nesting substrate, compared to unraised areas, with one study finding that a similar proportion of nests were lost to flooding in raised and unraised areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn habitats prone to flooding, inundation with water may be a significant cause of mortality. Providing nests or nesting habitat that is protected from water (e.g. by being raised) may therefore increase reproductive success."
