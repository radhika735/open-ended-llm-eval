The study examined the effects on the Californian abalone fishery (USA).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOURS (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour-change (1 study): One before-and-after study in California found no significant reduction in non-compliance with daily quotas of abalones after introducing tagging regulations.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nIllegal catch (1 study): One before-and-after study in California found no significant reduction in illegal takes of abalones after introducing tagging regulations.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including overharvest (Hobday et al. 2000). Populations of certain species have declined to such extent that they are now protected, and their fishing and harvesting is controlled and/or illegal (Stierhoff et al. 2012). For species for which fishing or harvesting is forbidden, animals can be tagged to deter illegal capture and potentially help reduce their population declines (Lewis 2015).\nEvidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set commercial catch quotas”, and “Species management – Set recreational catch quotas” and “Etablish size limitations for the capture of recreational species”.\n \nHobday A.J., Tegner M.J. & Haaker P.L.
