  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of altering water flow rates on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that releasing a large flow of water into a wetland system had mixed effects on relative abundance of eastern long-necked turtles and the number of turtles caught.\nCondition (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that after releasing a large flow of water into a wetland system, body condition of eastern long-necked turtles improved.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nChanges to natural stream flows, for example channelization, may negatively impact reptiles due to faster moving water (Bodie 2001), and changes in summer flow rates may alter the time available for nesting, impact the timing of hatching and affect survival rates (Lenhart et al. 2013). Interventions aimed at recovering natural flows, for example by removing the structures causing channelization and increasing flow rates or providing areas that have varied flow rates may address this threat.\nBodie J.R.
