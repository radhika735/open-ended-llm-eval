  "action_id": "1577",
  "action_title": "Create buffer zones around protected primate habitat",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of creating buffer zones around protected primate habitat on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBuffer zones are areas peripheral to a specific protected area, where restrictions on resource use and special development measures are undertaken in order to enhance the conservation value of the protected area. Buffer zones therefore act as a transition zone between the protected area where no/very limited resource use is permitted and the area outside the protected area where no resource use restrictions are enforced. Buffer zones have been suggested as a particularly suitable practice for climate change mitigation, as they may facilitate the shifting of populations from reserves to adjacent areas according to the climatic needs of species."
