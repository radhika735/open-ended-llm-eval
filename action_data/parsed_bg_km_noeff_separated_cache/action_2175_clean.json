  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of transplanting and/or translocating bioremediating species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome sources of pollution, for instance from sewage outfalls, aquaculture farms, or agriculture wastes in watercourses, can cause an excess in nutrients leading to eutrophication, phytoplankton blooms, and reduction in water quality such as reduced light and oxygen. This type of pollution can be biologically ‘remediated’ (reverse, removed, or counteracted) by transplanting or translocating particular species to the affected area (Sode et al. 2013). These species, called ‘bioremediating species’ can naturally improve water quality through feeding (for instance filter-feeding species such as mussels), or through photosynthesis (for instance algae species) (Chung et al. 2002). Transplanting or translocating such species to a polluted area may reduce pollution levels and allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to recover over time (Sode et al. 2013).\nEvidence for interventions related to pollution bioremediation are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use other bioremediation methods in aquaculture”, and evidence related to transplantation and/or translocation of species are summarised under the chapter “Species management”.\n \nChung I.K., Kang Y.H., Yarish C., Kraemer G.P. & Lee J.A.
