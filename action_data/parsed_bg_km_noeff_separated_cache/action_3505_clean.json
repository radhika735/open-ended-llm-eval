  "action_id": "3505",
  "action_title": "Retain/maintain road verges as habitat",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining/maintaining road verges as habitat on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRoads can damage or destroy grassland habitats that host reptiles, but roadside verges may be used by reptiles (e.g. Carthew et al. 2013). Maintaining road verges with reptiles in mind may contribute towards mitigating habitat loss.\nCarthew S.M., Garrett L.A. & Ruykys L. (2013) Roadside vegetation can provide valuable habitat for small, terrestrial fauna in South Australia. Biodiversity and conservation, 22, 737–754."
