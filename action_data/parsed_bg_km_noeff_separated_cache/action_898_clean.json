  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One controlled, randomized, replicated experiment in Martinique found that growing cover crops resulted in more diverse nematode communities. One replicated trial from the USA found greater microbial biomass under ryegrass compared to a ryegrass/vetch cover crop mix.\nSoil structure: Three randomized, replicated studies from Denmark, Turkey and the UK found that growing cover crops improved soil structure and nutrient retention. One trial found higher soil porosity, interconnectivity and lower resistance in soil under cover crops, and one found reduced nitrate leaching.\nSoil organic carbon: One replicated study from Denmark and one review based mainly in Japan found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops. One study also found soil carbon levels increased further when legumes were included in cover crops.\nSoil organic matter: One replicated study from Denmark and three controlled, randomized, replicated studies from Australia and the USA measured the effect of growing cover crops. Three found increased nitrogen levels under cover crops, three found increased carbon, and one found increased nitrates. One trial showed that they increased regardless of whether those crops were legumes or not. Two studies from Europe (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no marked effect on soil organic matter levels.\nYield: One replicated trial from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils which had been under a ryegrass cover crop.\n \nSOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, loam, sandy clay, sandy-loam, silty-clay, silty-loam.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe Shannon diversity index or diversity indices generally are a measure of how many different species there are in a given sample, and how many individuals are present in each species. Soil pore interconnectivity is a measure of how connected air spaces in the soil are. High pore interconnectivity is an indicator of good soil health. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and have a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). Measuring the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal proteins present in the soil enables us to estimate how abundant it is. Soil microbial respiration is the production of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) when soil organisms respire (breaking down molecules to produce energy),and can be used to measure microbial activity.\nBardgett (2005) The Biology of Soil: A community and ecosystem approach.
