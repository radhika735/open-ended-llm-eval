  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated, before-and-after studies in the USA found that feeding whole carcasses reduced pacing levels in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars. However, it increased pacing in tigers.\nOne replicated, randomized, controlled study in Denmark found that when fed whole rabbit, cheetahs had lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A levels compared to supplemented beef. One replicated before-and-after study in Denmark found that feeding whole rabbit showed lower levels of inflammatory bowel indicators in cheetahs.\nOne replicated, randomized study and one controlled study in the USA found that when fed whole 1 to 3 day old chickens, ocelots had lower digestible energy and fat compared to a commercial diet and African wildcats had had lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFor most carnivorous species, whole carcasses, including bones, skin and cartilage are a large part of their diet in the wild. These parts of the carcass help facilitate digestion of many species, including cheetahs [1]; they also include essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids which are not always present in commercial or meat only diets. Furthermore, carcasses require more manipulation before and whilst consuming, potentially allowing more natural feeding behaviours.\nDepauw S., Bosch G., Hesta M., Whitehouse-Tedd K., Hendriks W.H., Kaandorp J., Janssens G.P.J. 2012.
