  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing ditches on farmland on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntensification of agricultural and other land management can result in loss of ditch biodiversity through activities such as mowing, grazing, and use of fertilizer and pesticides leading to water pollution. These may affect reptile populations. Ditch management practices can vary in terms of the frequency, season and technique used to clean or dredge ditches or may involve the maintenance of erosion control structures."
