  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in South AfricaÂ found that building artificial bird perches increased the number of seeds at two sites, but no shrubs became established at either of these sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBuilding bird perches in degraded shrublands may help to encourage birds to perch on them. As a result the number of droppings deposited by birds at the site may increase, increasing the probability that the site will be colonized by plants."
