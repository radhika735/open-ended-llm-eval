  "action_title": "Create legislation for ‘no net loss’ of wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland habitats, of creating legislation for no net loss of wetlands.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLegislation may be developed to ensure no net loss of habitat. Simply, this means that any habitat lost to development must be compensated for by restoration or creation elsewhere. For example, under the Clean Water Act in the USA, a permit for development on wetlands may only be granted if there are plans to restore or create other wetlands. Alternatively, wetlands can be ‘bought’ from a ‘bank’ of restoration or creation projects to offset damage done by a particular development (Burgin 2010).\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: legally protect peatlands.\nBurgin S. (2010) ‘Mitigation banks’ for wetland conservation: a major success or an unmitigated disaster. Wetlands Ecology and Management, 18, 49–55."
