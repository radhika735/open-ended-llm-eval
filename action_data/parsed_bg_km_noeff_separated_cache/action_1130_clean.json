  "action_title": "Floating pennywort: Use of liquid nitrogen",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the use of liquid nitrogen for control of floating pennywort.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLiquid nitrogen may provide a tool for localised control of floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides when used in combination with other control methods.  However, it is reported that some water boards in the Netherlands have tried to eradicate stands of floating pennywort using liquid nitrogen, and have found this to be unsuccessful due to persistence of regenerative plant material below the water surface (Hussner et al. 2012).  A description of the treatment and results has not been reported; therefore it has not been possible to confirm these results (Hussner et al. 2012).\nHussner A., Denys L., & Van Valkenburg J.L.C.H. (2012)  Hydrocotyle ranunculoides NOBANIS – Invasive Alien Species Factsheet, 13pp."
