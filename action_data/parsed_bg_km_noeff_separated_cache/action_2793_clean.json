  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of deploying fishing gear at different depths. The study was in the Arafura Sea (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (1 study): One controlled study in the Arafura Sea found that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDeploying fishing gear at different depths may reduce interactions with marine and freshwater mammals, and subsequent entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of mammals. However, the feasibility of this intervention will depend on the type of fishery and the ecology of the target species."
