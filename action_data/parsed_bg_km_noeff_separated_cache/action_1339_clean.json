  "action_title": "Primates: Provide food at natural (wild) feeding times",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of providing food to primates at natural (wild) feeding times.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention is specifically for nocturnal and diurnal primates. Feeding them during daylight hours is not suitable and therefore provisions must be put in place in captivity to allow them to express natural feeding behaviours at night or if preferred at dawn and dusk."
