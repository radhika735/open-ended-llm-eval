  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of strengthening cultural traditions that prevent timber harvesting.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nForests have important cultural value in many societies around the world, which has led to many areas being protected under local tradition or law. As the surrounding forest is logged or managed, these cultural sites may become increasingly important for conservation, as they preserve intact, primary forest. However, national Governments or logging companies which do not respect local traditions may seek to exploit these sites and, if offered enough money or improvements to their livelihoods, local people may agree or be forced to accept this. Strengthening cultural traditions which protect forests, either within local communities or by lobbying national Governments, may help to prevent exploitation of these important sites."
