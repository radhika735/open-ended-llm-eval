  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all non-towed (static) fishing gears on marine fish populations. The study was in the Coral Sea (Australia).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Coral Sea found that in areas closed to non-towed fishing gears overall shark abundance was higher when sampled with longlines but not gillnets compared to areas where commercial gillnets were permitted.\nCondition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Coral Sea found that in areas closed to non-towed fishing gears shark length was greater for two of five species/groups, similar for two and dependent on sampling gear for one species, compared to areas where commercial gillnets were permitted.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed. Non-towed or static fishing gear (various types of nets, longlines, pots and traps) are usually considered less damaging than mobile gears (Broadhurst et al. 2006). However, they can be deployed in areas inaccessible to towed gears and some types can catch large quantities of fish, including unwanted species and sizes. Ceasing or prohibiting all static gears in an area can remove the direct fishing pressure on marine fish and may reduce unwanted fish catch.\nBroadhurst M.K., Suuronen P. & Hulm A.
