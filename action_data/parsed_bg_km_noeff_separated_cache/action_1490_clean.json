  "action_title": "Clear open patches in the forest",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of clearing open patches in the forest on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSelective logging can substantially change the forest structure. For example, Thiollay (1997) showed that regenerating stands in northern French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) had dense undergrowth and an open canopy, which was the inverse of that of the primary forest, which typically has an open understorey and a closed canopy. This change in forest structure as a result of selective logging may negatively affect primates, both arboreal and terrestrial in acquiring resources, shelter and their ability to move through the forest. This intervention aims at reducing part of the impact described above (at least for the more terrestrial primate species) by clearing open patches in the forest to get rid of the dense undergrowth.\n            The removal of trees to reduce density is discussed under ‘Thin trees within forests’. The clearing of secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation is discussed under ‘Manually control or remove secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation’.\n \nThiollay J.-M.
