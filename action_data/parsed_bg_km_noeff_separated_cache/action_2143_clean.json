  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of modifying the design of traps on subtidal benthic invertebrates. One study took place in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain), and one in the South Pacific Ocean (New Zealand).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nUnwanted catch abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the Mediterranean Sea and the South Pacific Ocean found that the amount of combined unwanted catch of invertebrates and fish varied with the type of trap design used and the area.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that plastic traps caught some legal-size commercially targeted lobsters while collapsible traps caught none.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTraps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). Trap design can be modified, such as by using different shape or material for the frame (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016; Major et al. 2017), to potentially reduce the amount of subtidal benthic invertebrate bycatch (Arrasate-López et al. 2012; Schoeman et al. 2002).\nEvidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Modify the position of traps” and “Use different bait species in traps”.\n \nAmengual-Ramis J.F., Vazquez-Archdale M., Canovas-Perez C. & Morales-Nin B.
