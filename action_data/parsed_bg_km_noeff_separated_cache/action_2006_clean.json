  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of decontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves to reduce the spread of the white-nose syndrome pathogen on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDecontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves may reduce the spread of the white-nose syndrome fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans by humans.\nWe found no studies evaluating the effects of decontaminating equipment when moving between caves on the spread of the white-nose syndrome fungus between bat populations. One study examined the effectiveness of different treatments to kill the white-nose syndrome fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans on clothing and materials used by cavers. Cleaning mud and sediment from clothing followed by treatment with commercially available disinfectants (e.g. household bleach) successfully killed the fungus, as did soaking clothing in water above 50˚C for at least 20 minutes (Shelley et al. 2013).\nShelley V., Kaiser S., Shelley E., Williams T., Kramer M., Haman K., Keel K. & Barton H.A. (2013) Evaluation of strategies for the decontamination of equipment for Geomyces destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS). Journal of Cave and Karst Studies, 75, 1–10."
