  "action_id": "1194",
  "action_title": "Imitate natural disturbances by pushing over trees",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe captured no evidence for the effects of imitating natural disturbances by pushing over trees on forests.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany forests in human-dominated landscapes are heavily managed reducing the likelihood of impacts from natural disturbances such as being blown over by strong winds or damage by large herbivores (which are often absent). Pushing or pulling over trees may imitate some of these mechanical disturbances and create a more heterogeneous environment, which may increase species diversity."
