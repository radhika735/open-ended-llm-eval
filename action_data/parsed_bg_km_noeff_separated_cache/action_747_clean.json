  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies investigated the effectiveness of retaining buffer strips during timber harvest for amphibians.\nSix replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers following clearcutting with or without riparian buffer strips. Five found mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width. One found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers.\nEleven studies, including 10 replicated and/or controlled studies in Canada and the USA and one meta-analysis, compared amphibian numbers in forest with riparian buffers retained during harvest to unharvested forest. Six found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood. Four found that abundance and species composition were similar to unharvested forest. Two found that numbers of species and abundance were lower than in unharvested forest.\nTwo of four replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled, before-and-after study) in Canada and the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were greater in wider riparian buffer strips. Two found that there was no difference in abundance in buffers of different widths.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRetaining forest strips along water courses or around ponds during timber harvest can help mitigate the effects of habitat loss and disturbance for forest species. They can also help sustain the microclimate and reduce potential problems such as soil erosion. Retained habitat strips also provide corridors for dispersal."
