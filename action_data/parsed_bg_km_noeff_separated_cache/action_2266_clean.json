  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of transplanting or releasing hatchery-reared crustacean species on their wild populations. Four examined lobsters in the North Sea (Germany, Norway, UK), and one examined prawns in the Swan-Canning Estuary (Australia).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nCrustacean abundance (1 study): One study in the Swan-Canning Estuary  found that after releasing hatchery-reared prawn larvae into the wild, the abundance of egg-bearing female prawns increased.\nCrustacean reproductive success (3 studies): Two studies (one controlled) in the North Sea found that after their release, recaptured hatchery-reared female lobsters carried eggs, and the number, size and developmental stage of eggs were similar to that of wild females. One study in the Swan-Canning Estuary  found that after releasing hatchery-reared prawn larvae into the wild the overall population fecundity (egg production/area) increased.\nCrustacean survival (2 studies): Two studies in the North Sea found that 50–84% and 32–39% of hatchery-reared lobsters survived in the wild after release, up to eight and up to five years, respectively.\nCrustacean condition (4 studies): Two studies in the North Sea found that hatchery-reared lobsters grew in the wild after release. One controlled study in the North Sea found that after release into the wild, hatchery-reared female lobsters had similar growth rates as wild females. One study in the North Sea found that after releasing hatchery-reared lobsters, no recaptured lobsters displayed signs of “Black Spot” disease, and 95% had developed a crusher-claw. One study in the Swan-Canning Estuary  found that after releasing hatchery-reared prawn larvae into the wild, the size of egg-bearing female prawns increased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nCrustacean movement (1 study): One controlled study in the North Sea found that after release into the wild, hatchery-reared female lobsters had similar movement patterns as wild females.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany populations of subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, such as habitat loss and overharvesting (Airoldi et al. 2008; Hobday et al. 2000). To counteract this phenomenon, captive-bred or hatchery-reared subtidal benthic invertebrates can be transplanted or released at a site, either to introduce a species to a new site (where they did not historically occur), to reintroduce a species to a site (where they used to occur), or to enhance the population at a site where the species is already present by increasing its abundance (Hansen & Gosselin 2013). As the outcomes of transplanting/releasing species can vary largely with the type of species, studies have been grouped by broader taxonomic group (e.g: crustaceans such as lobsters or prawns; or molluscs such as abalone, scallops, or mussels).\nHere, only direct transplanting/releasing methods have been considered, without added interventions or changes to the methods to improve survival after release. However, when transplant/release was undertaken in predator exclusion cages, evidence has been summarised under “Species management – Transplant/release captive-bred or hatchery-reared species in predator exclusion cages”.\n       When transplanting hatchery-reared individuals is undertaken for a habitat-forming species, effects on the invertebrates associated with the habitat are reported in “Habitat restoration and creation – Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Evidence from translocation studies of naturally occurring species is summarised under “Species management – Translocate species” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Translocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species”.\n \nAiroldi L., Balata D. & Beck M.W.
