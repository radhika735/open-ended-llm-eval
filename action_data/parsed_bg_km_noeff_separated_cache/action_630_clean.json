  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study in Mauritius describes the establishment of a population of Mauritius fody Foudia rubra following the release of captive-bred individuals.\nFour studies of three release programmes on Hawaii found high survival of all three species released (Hawaiian crows Corvus hawaiiensis and two thrushes: omao Myadestes obscurus and puaiohi M. palmeri), with the two thrushes successfully breeding. The authors in one note that many of the released puaiohi dispersed from the release site, meaning that repopulating specific areas may require multiple releases.\nA replicated, controlled study from the USA found that San Clemente loggerhead shrike Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi pairs with captive-bred females had lower reproductive success than pairs where both parents were wild-bred.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc)."
