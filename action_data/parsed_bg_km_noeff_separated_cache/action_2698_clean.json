  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty-five studies examined the effect of using a different hook type on marine fish populations. Nine studies were in the Atlantic Ocean (Portugal, South Africa, USA, Brazil, Portugal, Iceland), six studies were in Pacific Ocean (New Zealand, Japan, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Fiji) and two studies were in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy). One study was in each of the Barents Sea (Norway), the Denmark Strait (Greenland), the Coral Sea (Australia) and the Strait of Gibraltar (Spain/Morocco). Four studies were reviews (worldwide, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (10 studies): Four of seven replicated, controlled studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Coral Sea and two of three worldwide systematic reviews, found that using different hook types in longline or recreational fisheries, including sizes, styles and other modifications to hooks, reduced the incidence of fish hook injuries (associated with higher post-release mortality), and reduced the capture mortality of some species of unwanted sharks and rays and non-target billfish species, compared to conventional hooks or other hook types. The other four studies found that using a different hook type did not reduce the post-release mortality of young sea breams, or the capture mortality of sharks species and non-target fish species, but did reduce the incidence of deep-hooking in some cases.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (20 studies): Eight of 16 replicated studies (13 controlled, one randomized) in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Barents Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Denmark Strait and Coral Sea, found that using a different hook type, including different sizes, styles and hook modifications, reduced the unwanted catch in longline and recreational hook fisheries of non-commercially targeted and targeted fish species, small non-target fish species, overall fish catch, overall discarded bony fish catch but not sharks and rays, undersized haddock, two of three unwanted fish species, non-target sharks and rays and non-target rays and sailfish, compared to standard hooks or hooks of other types. Seven studies found that changing hook type did not reduce the unwanted catch of young or non-target fish species, unwanted sharks and rays, unwanted blue shark, unwanted roughhead grenadier or non-target pelagic stingray and silky shark, compared to standard or other hook types. The other study found that catch rates of young groupers, and non-target fish and shark species varied with hook design, and larger hooks caught fewer non-target fish species overall, but more undersized grouper and sharks compared to other hook types. Four global systematic reviews found that hook style did not affect the unwanted catch of billfish species, sharks and rays or sharks, compared to standard styles.\nImproved size-selectivity of fishing gear (3 studies): Two of three replicated studies in the Atlantic Ocean and Strait of Gibraltar, found that increasing hook sizes improved the size-selectivity (by increasing the average catch length) of hottentot and black spot seabream compared to smaller hook sizes. The other study found that a different hook size improved size selectivity for two of five commercially targeted fish species and was also affected by bait size.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn hook and line fishing, a fishing line is set with single or multiple baited hooks to attract fish. Whilst hook and line fishing is generally considered to be relatively selective, resulting in less unwanted catch than other gears, the type of hook used can influence the species and size of fish captured as well as the extent of hooking injury. Larger hooks, for example, may be effective at avoiding capture of smaller unwanted fish, whilst hooks of different shapes can also affect catch composition. Circle hooks, for example, are hooks on which the point is curved backwards in a circular shape, perpendicular to the main shaft, as opposed to a ‘J’ hook, which has the point parallel to the main shaft. Circle hooks may therefore reduce the incidence of hook swallowing in captured fish, minimising the severity of hooking injury and increasing survival in unwanted catch after release. Other modifications may include attaching inedible objects to hooks to act as deterrents to smaller fish or modifying the configuration of hooks on the mainline, such as changing the attachments.\nEvidence for similar interventions affecting the capture of fish on hook and line is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Use a different bait type’ and ‘Modify longline configuration’. See also, ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Deploy fishing gear at selected depths to avoid unwanted species’."
