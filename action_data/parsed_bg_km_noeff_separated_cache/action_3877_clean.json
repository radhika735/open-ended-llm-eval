  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in forests. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (4 studies): Three of four studies (including one replicated study, one paired study, two controlled studies, two before-and-after studies, and one site comparison study) in the USA found that coniferous forest restored 1–2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) or burned once within the last 20 years, had a higher species richness of butterflies than unburned forest. The fourth study found that mixed forest and shrubland sites which had been burned the year before had similar butterfly species richness to unburned sites.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study and one site comparison study) in the USA found that pine forest restored 1–2 years ago by burning (in combination with thinning) had a higher abundance of butterflies than unburned forest. One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia reported that in the spring after selective burning of eucalyptus forest there were fewer Eltham copper caterpillars than before.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAlthough many species of butterflies and moths are found in woodland, most prefer areas with open glades or a sparse understorey, where light can penetrate and enable flowering plants to grow, as well as providing areas for basking. One option for opening up dense areas of woodland is to use prescribed burning. Although destructive in the short-term, with likely loss of butterflies and moths through direct mortality or reductions in food availability (Glaves et al. 2013), burning may have long-term benefits by creating a more favourable, open habitat (Bubová et al. 2015). However, the impact of fires can vary depending on their exact characteristics, such as the frequency, temperature, ground surface intensity, time and size of burning compared to the surrounding unburned areas (Swengel 2001, Tucker 2003, New et al. 2010), and caution should be taken before instigating fire in place of alternative management options such as grazing or cutting.\nFor studies using prescribed burning in naturally open habitats, see “Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in grasslands or other open habitats”. For other options for reducing the density of woodlands, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Clear or open patches in forests”, “Habitat restoration and creation – Coppice woodland”, “Habitat restoration and creation – Thin trees within forests” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Create young plantations within mature woodland”.\nBubová T., Vrabec V., Kulma M. & Nowicki P.
