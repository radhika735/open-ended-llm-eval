  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA and Spain found that grass strips between vine rows had a greater species richness of butterflies than the vine rows themselves, and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had a greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards. The other study found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a similar species richness of butterflies to conventionally managed vineyards.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a greater abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAs perennial crops, vineyards form large areas of consistent agricultural habitat across Mediterranean-type landscapes. Like other perennial crops, this creates opportunities to manage vineyards as complete ecosystems, by providing the resources which butterflies and moths need within the crop. This could include encouraging native plant species to grow around the vines, altering the timing or frequency of management such as pruning and tillage, or reducing the application of chemicals to the vines or surrounding habitat.\nFor studies which test reductions in chemical application alone, see “Threat: Pollution”."
