  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of training tourist guides to minimize disturbance and promote marine and freshwater mammal conservation. The study was in the Kenai Fjords (Alaska).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Kenai Fjords found that fewer harbour seals were disturbed during kayak excursions after training was provided to kayak guides.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTourist guides may be trained to minimize disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals during tours, and to promote conservation. This may include training to follow specific guidelines (e.g. see Introduce and enforce regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours). Promoting marine and freshwater mammal conservation during tours may help to improve the behaviour of attendees towards mammals, not only during tours but also in future."
