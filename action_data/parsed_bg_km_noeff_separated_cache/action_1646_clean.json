  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that grazing to reduce grass cover had mixed effects on cover of common heather and cross-leaved heath.\nOne replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that cover of wavy-hair grass increased and one before-and-after study in Spain found a reduction in grass height.",

Increasing the number of livestock or altering the type of livestock therefore may reduce grass cover of problematic species and allow shrubland plant species to increase in cover."
