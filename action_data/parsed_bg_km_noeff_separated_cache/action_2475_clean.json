  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of preserving genetic material for use in future captive breeding programs. One study was in Mexico and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): A study in Mexico found that a series of non-traditional techniques, combined with natural mating, produced five aoudad embryos that could be cryogenically preserved. A study in USA, found that artificial insemination using preserved genetic material increased genetic diversity and lowered inbreeding in a captive black‐footed ferret population.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAssisted reproductive technology is advancing rapidly. For rare mammals, preservation of genetic material provides potential to increase reproductive output from a small number of individuals and to retain embryos or other material for future development.\nNote that many relevant studies may be documented in journals that are not primarily conservation-related and which are, therefore, not included in our systematic searches for evidence."
