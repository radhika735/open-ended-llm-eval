  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of controlling non-native prey species to reduce populations and impacts of non-native predators.\n\n'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe impact of non-native predators on native mammals can be more severe than that of native predators (Salo et al. 2007). Non-native predators may also feed on non-native prey and, in some situations, reducing non-native prey availability may lead to reductions in numbers of their non-native predators (Murphy et al. 1998; Mutze et al. 2017). This has potential to reduce the impact of non-native predators on native mammalian prey species.\nMurphy E.C., Clapperton B.K., Bradfield P.M.F. & Speed H.J.
