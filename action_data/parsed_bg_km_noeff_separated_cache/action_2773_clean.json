  "action_title": "License fish buyers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of licensing fish buyers on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-compliance of fisheries regulations is a common occurrence and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity is a huge threat to fish populations worldwide. The licensing of fish buyers may act as a deterrent to help prevent the buying and selling of illegal catches of fish and thus may help to mitigate the effects of overfishing and conserve fish populations."
