  "action_id": "3535",
  "action_title": "Use technology and reporting systems to avoid collisions",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using technology and reporting systems to avoid collisions.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMost technological solutions for avoiding collisions have been deployed to protect marine mammals but may present viable solutions for protecting sea turtles as well (Schoeman et al. 2020). Systems are typically used to let vessel operators know about the presence of high densities or recent sightings of animals in real time to allow operators to reduce speeds or change course.\nSchoeman R.P., Patterson-Abrolat C. & Plön S. (2020) A global review of vessel collisions with marine animals. Frontiers in Marine Science, 7, 292."
