  "action_title": "<i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Draining the waterway",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effect of draining the waterway as a control tool for Procambarus crayfish. \n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDraining a water body offers a potential control of invasive crayfish by making the location uninhabitable. While some individuals may die as a result of such management, many species are able to tolerate exposure to the air and can walk to adjacent water bodies. A trial in the Czech Republic found that three successive drawdowns of a 0.16 ha pond, followed by hand removal, was not able to remove all signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (Zozak & Policar 2002).Â  In addition, a review reported that draining habitat can have a significant, short-term impact, reducing populations of red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkia (Stebbing et al. 2012). However, it also reported that this approach causes significant impacts on natural habitats, is expensive, and does not lead to eradication.\nZozak P. & Policar, T.
