  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing nurse plants to brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on a mudflat in the USA found that planting black mangrove Avicennia germinans seedlings into created stands of saltwort Batis maritima did not clearly affect their survival, over seven weeks, compared to planting into bare mud.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNurse plants, also known as companion plants or pioneer plants, can be planted alongside focal plants to help the focal plants establish (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants may benefit focal plants in variety of ways, including: trapping and stabilizing sediments, trapping propagules, mitigating harsh environmental conditions (e.g. temperature fluctuations and strong sunlight), attracting pollinators, deflecting herbivory away from focal species, and/or limiting weed establishment.\nCaution: Nurse plant species must be chosen carefully. Species that spread easily or are very strong competitors can cause more harm than good. For example, the non-native mangrove apple Sonneratia apetala has been used to restore Chinese mangroves, but has spread into neighbouring forests (Ren et al. 2009). Use of non-native nurse plants may not always be ethically acceptable.\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have (a) deliberately introduced nurse plants before planting target marsh or swamp vegetation, and (b) reported the effects of the nurse plants on other vegetation, not just the survival or growth of the nurse plants. Studies must have explicitly planted vegetation for its nursing effect. Studies are not summarized as evidence here if they planted target vegetation into existing nurse vegetation (e.g. Egerova et al. 2003; McKee et al. 2007), or examined spontaneous colonization amongst planted nurse vegetation.\nRelated actions: Introduce nurse plants without introducing target marsh or swamp vegetation.\nEgerova J., Proffitt C.E. & Travis S.E.
