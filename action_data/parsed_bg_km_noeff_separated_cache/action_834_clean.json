  "action_id": "834",
  "action_title": "Use artificial fertilization in captive breeding",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree replicated studies (including two randomized studies) in Australia and the USA found that the success of artificial fertilization depended on the type and number of doses of hormones used to stimulate egg production. One replicated study in Australia found that 55% of eggs were fertilized artificially, but soon died.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReproductive technologies such as artificial fertilization are techniques that can be used in an attempt to achieve or increase breeding success by captive amphibians. Many amphibians have external fertilization, making this technique relatively simple. However, consideration must be given to the storage and ratio of sperm and eggs, effects of temperature, solution strength and egg jelly on the potential for fertilization."
