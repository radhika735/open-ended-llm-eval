  "action_title": "Modify logging practices in watershed to reduce pollution",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation in marshes or swamps, of modifying logging practices in the watershed to reduce pollution.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHigh intensity logging within watersheds – when a large proportion of the trees are removed, or trees are removed frequently – can cause pollution problems in marshes or swamps below. Erosion and landslides following logging activity can increase sediment loads, reducing water clarity or even filling wetlands completely (Lele 2009; Adamus 2014).\nThis action includes a range of specific actions, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use, that might reduce pollution from logging in wetland catchments. Logging less frequently or less intensely would leave more trees to intercept rainfall and hold together the soil, reducing sediment run-off. Additionally, any logging that is carried out could follow low-impact principles such as planning vehicle extraction routes, extraction of timber by helicopter, and directional felling.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Change season/timing of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Use low-impact methods to harvest vegetation within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Reduce fertilizer or herbicide use (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Manage fertilizer or herbicide application.\nAdamus P.
