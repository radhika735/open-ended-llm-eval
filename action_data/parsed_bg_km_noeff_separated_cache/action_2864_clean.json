  "action_title": "Add chemicals or minerals to sediment to remove or neutralize pollutants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of adding chemicals or minerals to sediment to remove or neutralize pollutants on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSediments within aquatic environments can accumulate pollutants over time, such as those leaching from aquaculture systems, sewage outfalls or nearby agricultural fields. Marine or freshwater mammals may be negatively affected by polluted sediments, particularly those feeding on or near the bottom of rivers or seas, or in areas where sediments are frequently disturbed. Chemicals or minerals may be added to sediments to reduce or remove pollutants (e.g. Kim et al. 2014, Shin & Kim 2016).\nKim K., Hibino T., Yamamoto T., Hayakawa S., Mito Y., Nakamoto K. & Lee I.-C. (2014) Field experiments on remediation of coastal sediments using granulated coal ash. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 83, 132–137.\nShin W. & Kim Y.-K. (2016) Stabilization of heavy metal contaminated marine sediments with red mud and apatite composite. Journal of Soils and Sediments, 16, 726–735."
