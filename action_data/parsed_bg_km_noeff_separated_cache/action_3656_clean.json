  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects of using prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application on reptile populations. Four studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that reptile community composition responded differently to herbicide treatment followed by burning or burning alone when compared to unburned areas or areas of more pristine habitat.\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that areas that were burned in combination with herbicide application had similar combined reptile and amphibian species richness and diversity compared to areas that were managed by burning or herbicide application alone or left unmanaged.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (including two before-and-after studies) in the USA found mixed effects of burning in combination with herbicide application on the abundance of reptiles and six-lined racerunners. The other study found that areas that were burned in combination with herbicide application had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to areas that were managed by burning or herbicide application alone or left unmanaged. The study also found that the abundance of eastern fence lizards was higher in the first year after burning and herbicide application compared to unmanaged areas, but similar for the next six years.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that some rocky outcrops that were burned in combination with herbicide application were recolonized by pink-tailed worm-lizards.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed burning may be used to reduce the chance of more extensive and damaging wildfires and to maintain and restore habitats historically subject to occasional wildfires. Using prescribed burning alongside herbicide application may combine the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire with the increased selectivity of herbicides.\nFor studies that assess these actions separately see Use prescribed burning and Habitat restoration and creation â€“ Manage vegetation using herbicides."
