  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of regulating water levels on reptile populations. This study was in France.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that autumn–spring marsh flooding with moderate levels of grazing in autumn–winter led to higher numbers of European pond turtles than winter–spring flooding with high levels of grazing in spring–summer.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDams or ‘impoundments’ directly influence reptile populations, especially turtles, by fragmenting habitat and causing nest mortality through flooding via artificial stream regulations (e.g. artificially raising water levels in summer for boat navigation purposes; Bodie 2001). Undamming rivers and restoring ecological flow are both management interventions used to increase river health and change water levels (Bednarek 2001).\nBednarek A.T. (2001) Undamming rivers: a review of the ecological impacts of dam removal. Environmental Management, 27, 803–814.\nBodie J.R. (2001) Stream and riparian management for freshwater turtles. Journal of Environmental Management, 62, 443–455."
