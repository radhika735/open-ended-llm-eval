  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour replicated studies from Canada and the USA  found that wider buffer strips retained a bird community more similar to that of uncut forest than narrower strips. Two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that several forest-specialist species were absent from buffers up to 70 m wide. \nTwo replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that richness was higher in buffers &lt;100 m wide, compared to wider strips or forest. A replicated, controlled study in the USA (6) found that thinned buffer strips had lower abundances of forest species than unthinned strips, but higher abundances of early successional species. A replicated study from the USA (4) found that species richness was similar between 20–50 m buffers and original forest.\nA replicated study from the USA found that bird abundances were higher in 20–50 m wide buffer strips than in original forest.\nA replicated study in the USA found no differences in productivity of birds nests between buffer strips wider than 350 m, compared to those thinner than 250 m. Whilst a replicated, controlled study from the USA found that predation of artificial nests was significantly higher in buffer strips compared with continuous forest, but that there was no diffrerence between narrow and wide buffers.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProvision or retention of forest strips in areas subject to timber extraction may be undertaken with the purported objectives of helping to mitigate the effects of loss of forest cover for woodland flora and fauna, as well as reducing potential problems such as soil erosion. Nature conservation aims include retaining valuable old forest features such as older trees with cavities and dead wood affording nest site and foraging opportunities for woodland birds. A similar intervention is ‘Ensure connectivity between habitat patches’, discussed in ‘Habitat protection’."
