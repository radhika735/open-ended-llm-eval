  "action_title": "Limit beam trawl width",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting beam trawl width on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBeam trawling can affect bottom fish communities through unwanted mortality and the effects of physical impact to the seabed (Jennings et al. 2012). The net of a beam trawl is kept open horizontally by a steel beam, the length of which varies between 4 and 12 m depending on the size of the vessel. Limits on the width of the beam trawl would reduce the area swept by the gear and may reduce the effects on fish communities, particularly flatfish, by limiting unwanted fish catch and mortality, as well as help reduce effects from impact to the seabed.\nJennings S., Lee J. & Hiddink J.G.
