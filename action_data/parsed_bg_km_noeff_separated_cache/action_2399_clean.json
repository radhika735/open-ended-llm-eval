  "action_title": "Change mowing regime (e.g. timing, frequency, height)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of changing mowing regime (e.g. timing, frequency, height) on mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies'’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNumerous studies assess responses of grassland vegetation structure and composition to different mowing regimes. Responses of fauna are less frequently documented with invertebrate responses dominating among those that are published. Some mammalian herbivores may be sensitive to variations in grassland vegetation height and structure (Mero et al. 2015). An understanding of responses to changes in mowing regimes may assist with development of tailored management for particular species.\n \nSee also: Habitat Restoration and Creation - Restore or create grassland.\n \nMero, TO., Bocz R., Polyak L., Horvath G. & Lengyel S.
