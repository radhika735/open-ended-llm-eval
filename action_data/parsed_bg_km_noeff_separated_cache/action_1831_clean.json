  "action_title": "Rewet peatland (before/after planting)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of rewetting (by raising the water table) areas planted with peatland plants.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe surface of exploited peatlands can be too dry for natural peatland vegetation. Drainage for agriculture, peat extraction or construction – within or near to a focal peatland – can dry out the peat surface. To rewet surface peat, the water table of a large area of peatland could be raised by e.g. blocking drainage ditches, blocking underground channels or peat pipes, building raised banks, switching off drainage pumps or restoring inflows.\nTo be included as evidence in this section, studies must have experimentally tested the effect of raising the water table on planted peatland vegetation (e.g. by comparing rewetted areas to areas that remain drained).\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: rewet peatlands without introducing vegetation; lower peatland surface by excavation/peat removal, bringing it closer to the water table; excavate/remove surface peat or irrigate peatland to complement planting."
