  "action_title": "Add surface mulch before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of mulching brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic mulches (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can be placed on the surface of wetlands to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of planted vegetation. Examples of substances than can be used as mulches include compost, straw, seagrass leaves and seaweed (macroalgae).\nCaution: It may be necessary to sterilize mulch before applying it, with heat or radiation, to kill propagules of undesirable plants. Adding organic matter as a mulch may be less labour intensive than mixing it into the soil or sediment, but increases the risk of the material being washed away.\nRelated actions: Add surface mulch, other than to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting."
