  "action_title": "Reduce chemical inputs in grassland management",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA total of 16 studies (including five reviews) investigated the effects of reducing inputs in permanent grasslands. Six studies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK (including one review and four replicated studies of which one was also controlled and one a randomized and controlled before-and-after trial) found that stopping fertilizer inputs in permanent grassland resulted in an increase in plant species richness, reduced the rate of plant species loss and attracted a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied. One review from the Netherlands found that low fertilizer input grasslands favour common meadow bird species. One review found a study showing that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots compared with those receiving nitrogen inputs.\nTwo replicated, controlled trials from the Czech Republic and the UK (one randomized) found that applying fertilizer to permanent grasslands reduced plant species richness or diversity and that the effects on plant communities were still apparent 16 years after the cessation of fertilizer application.\nFour studies from Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK (including two replicated trials of which one randomized and one controlled and a review) found that reducing fertilizer inputs on grassland had no clear or rapid effect on plant species richness. A review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates. One replicated study found that fertilizer treatment only affected seed production of a small number of meadow plants. One replicated study from the UK found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs but the differences were not significant.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention may involve reducing the amount of chemical inputs applied to permanent grasslands or ceasing inputs altogether. Chemical inputs to permanent grasslands may include fertilizers such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), or potassium (K).\nReducing chemical inputs on permanent grasslands is often used in conjunction with other actions such as delaying the first mowing or grazing date on grasslands, see also ‘Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands’."
