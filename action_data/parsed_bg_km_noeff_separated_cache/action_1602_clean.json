  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Decontamination / preventing further spread",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence on the effects of decontamination to prevent further spread of parrot’s feather.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n Parrot’s feather plants are capable of rapidly regenerating from small fragments, and are highly tolerant of desiccation (Hussner & Champion 2011). As a consequence the species can be easily transported between waterbodies when attached to fishing or watersport equipment, imported with soil or as fragments on machinery. The decontamination of equipment and matter, using for instance hot water or bleach, could therefore potentially limit the spread of the species.\n \nHussner A. & Champion P.D. (2011). Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) verdcourt (parrot feather). Pages 103–112 in: Francis, R.A. (ed.) A Handbook of Global Freshwater Invasive Species. Earthscan Publisher, New York."
