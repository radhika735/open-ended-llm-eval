  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing acoustic wildlife warnings along roads. One study was in Demark and one was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nBehaviour change (2 studies): A before-and-after study in Denmark found that sound from acoustic road markings did not alter fallow deer behaviour. A controlled study in Australia found that Roo-Guard® sound emitters did not deter tammar wallabies from food and so were not considered suitable for keeping them off roads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCollisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions may be employed to deter mammals for accessing roads. This can include use of acoustic warnings which can either be devices that emit sounds or modifications to the road surface that produce noise when vehicle tyres pass over them.\nSee also: Fit vehicles with ultrasonic warning devices.\nConover M.R., Pitt W.C., Kessler K.K., DuBow T.J. & Sanborn W.A.
