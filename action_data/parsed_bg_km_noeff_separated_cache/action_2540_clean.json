  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving headlands in fields unsprayed. One study was in the UK and one was in the Netherlands.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one also controlled) in the UK and the Netherlands, found that crop edge headlands that were not sprayed with pesticides were used more by mice than were sprayed crop edges.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nConservation headland management may involve restricting fertiliser, herbicide and insecticide spraying along a strip through a sown arable crop. Typically, as under agri-environment schemes practiced in Europe, this may be a 6-m-wide strip with selected herbicide applications permitted to control certain weeds or invasive species."
