  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated, controlled, before-and after trial in North America found that suction dredging reduced Asian clam densities within the sediment by 96% over two weeks and that the reduction persisted for a year.\nA replicated, controlled, before-and-after field trial in Ireland found that three types of dredges were equally effective at removing Asian clams, resulting in a biomass reduction ranging from 74% to &gt;95%, and an density reduction ranging from 65% to 95%.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTechnology for collecting clams from sediments has been well-developed in commercial shellfisheries. Such tools can be employed within open water systems to remove Asian clams Corbicula spp."
