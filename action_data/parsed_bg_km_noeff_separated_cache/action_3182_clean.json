  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of building barriers to protect littoral brackish/salt marshes from rising water levels and severe weather. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Italy and one was in the Netherlands.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that protecting salt marshes with offshore structures had no significant effect on the seaward limit of emergent vegetation, after 17–27 months. It was similar, or retreated at a similar rate, in protected and unprotected marshes. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that brackish marshes protected with oyster shell reefs receded less, over one year, than unprotected marshes.\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that marshes protected with low sea walls had a similar overall plant community composition to nearby natural salt marshes, 15–22 years after the walls were built.\nOverall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study in Italy reported that a salt marsh protected with an offshore fence contained more plant species, after 17 months, than an unfenced marsh. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands recorded 85 plant and algal species across two salt marshes that had developed behind low sea walls, over 15–22 years, compared to 155 species recorded across multiple natural marshes in the region.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (2 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that brackish/salt marshes protected with offshore structures contained a similar total amount of vegetation to unprotected marshes. This was true for cover and biomass.\nIndividual species abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes protected with offshore breakwaters (and planted with cordgrasses Spartina spp.) typically contained less smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that in marshes protected with low sea walls for 15–22 years and nearby natural salt marshes, the same plant species were the most frequent.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes protected with offshore breakwaters (and planted with cordgrasses Spartina spp.) contained shorter smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora plants, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLittoral wetlands (on sea or lake shores) are vulnerable to physical damage from strong waves, and from excessive flooding linked to storm surges and rising water levels. These threats may be reduced by building barriers such as dykes, walls, breakwaters, reefs, groynes, coconut-fibre rolls or even additional marshes or swamps. Barriers can provide some immediate shelter from wave energy. They can also encourage sediment deposition, potentially helping existing marshes or swamps to keep up with sea level rise or building a surface at suitable elevation for emergent vegetation (Wetlands International 2016). Barriers could be installed temporarily to protect colonizing vegetation, or could be used as permanent protection.\nCaution: Littoral areas are naturally exposed to wind, waves and flooding. Some disturbance from these elements may be necessary to maintain a diversity of coastal habitats and normal wetland functions. For example, restricting tidal influx to coastal marshes may limit their natural tendency to accumulate sediment and organic matter to keep up with sea level rise (Redfield & Rubin 1962; Nyman et al. 2006). If barriers are left in place for many years, it may not be possible to ever remove them without flooding the marshes or swamps they were intended to protect.\nRelated actions: Build barriers to protect littoral areas from boat wakes; Divert/replace/block saltwater inputs; Use artificial barriers to block pollution; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.\nNyman J.A., Walters R.J., Delaune R.D. & Patrick W.H.
