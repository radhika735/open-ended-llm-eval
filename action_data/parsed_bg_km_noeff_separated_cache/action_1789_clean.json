  "action_title": "Remove pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of removing pollutants from waste gases before release into the environment. The study was in bogs.\nPlant richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after study in bogs in EstoniaÂ reported that following installation of dust filters in industrial plants (along with a general reduction in emissions), the number of Sphagnum moss species increased but the total number of plant species decreased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAtmospheric pollutants can be removed from waste gases (e.g. from industry or transport) before they enter the environment. Physical or electrostatic filters can trap dust and ash particles. Sulphur dioxide can be removed by spraying alkaline substances (such as seawater) into waste gases. Reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants may prevent damage to peatland vegetation or allow it to recover.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: clean waste water before it is released into the environment."
