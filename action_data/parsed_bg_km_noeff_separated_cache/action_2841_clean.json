Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntroducing permits or licences for recreational watersports (e.g. boating, kayaking, jet-skiing, diving, snorkelling, recreational fishing etc.) may reduce disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals. This may involve limiting the number and/or type of activities that are permitted to take place in an area. Conditions of permits/licences may also require that individuals follow specific guidelines while carrying out watersports (e.g. minimum approach distances, speed limits etc.), and report marine mammal encounters."
