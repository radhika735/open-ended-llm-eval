  "action_title": "Improve soil quality after tree planting (excluding applying fertilizer)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne of two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in AustraliaÂ found that different soil enhancers had mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height, but no effect on tree seedling health. The other found that combinations of soil enhancers did not increase seedling survival, height, diameter or health.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing soil enhancers (excluding fertilizers) can improve soil properties and may therefore enhance tree growth and biodiversity in degraded forest areas. However, it may also enhance growth of other undesired plants."
