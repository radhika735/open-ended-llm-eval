  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effect of creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable, cropped grass or pasture fields on mammals. Six studies were in the UK, two were in Switzerland and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found more small mammal species in uncultivated field margins than in blocks of set-aside.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (9 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found more small mammals in uncultivated and unmown field margins than in frequently mown margins. Three of seven replicated, site comparison studies (one randomized), in the UK and Switzerland, found that uncultivated field margins had higher numbers of small mammals, bank voles and brown hares relative to crops (including grassland) and set-aside. The other four studies reported mixed or no effects on bank voles, wood mice and common shrews, small mammals and brown hares. One site comparison study in the UK found that brown hares used grassy field margins more than expected based on their availability.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention entails allowing field margin vegetation to regenerate naturally, typically without planting. It can involve some subsequent mowing. Field margins are not fertilized. This intervention includes field margins that run alongside waterways, where these are not otherwise managed, such as by planting trees (for which, see Habitat Restoration and Creation - Restore or create forest)."
