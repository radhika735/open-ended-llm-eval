  "action_title": "Thin trees after wildfire",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive replicated, controlled studies examined the effects of thinning trees in burnt forest areas. Two studies in Spain found that thinning increased plant species richness. One in Canada found that it increased the cover of aspen saplings. One study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one in Israel found it decreased mortality of pine seedlings.\nOne paired-site study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAfter wildfires, thinning is often used as a conservation management practice to reduce fuels (wood) and to reduce future fire risk. This can enhance forest growth, increase its species richness, as well as species and structural diversity."
