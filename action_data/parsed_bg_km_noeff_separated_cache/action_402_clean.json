  "action_title": "Use artificial nests that discourage predation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree trials in North America found lower predation or higher nesting success of wildfowl in nest boxes or nesting ‘tubs’ than natural nests in tree cavities or on the ground.\nA trial in captivity found that raccoons could be prevented from entering nest boxes if they were topped with a metal cone with a 7.6 cm overhang and the distance between entrance hole and the roof was increased from 30 to 60 cm.\nA replicated study in the USA found that fewer woods duck Aix sponsa used nest boxes with predator guards on when given the choice of unaltered boxes, but that both designs were used with equal frequency when only one design was available.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNest boxes are distinctive and often easier to see than natural nests. Therefore there is the possibility that predators will learn to associate boxes with nests and target them specifically. This could even lead to nest boxes acting as ‘ecological traps’ – with birds using them preferentially but having very low reproductive success in them. Therefore, ‘anti-predator’ devices and boxes may be desirable."
