  "action_title": "Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels, on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial, recreational, industrial, and military vessels can generate large amounts of liquid waste, such as sewage, grey waters, and bilge waters (Welles 2003). Discharge of these wastes overboard can impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area can potentially reduce or stop the source of pollution. In many parts of the world, it is illegal to dispose of waste effluents into coastal waters or delimited zones, for instance following local bylaws.\nFor an intervention related to the discharge of solid waste, see Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels.\nWelles L.K. (2003) Comment: Due to loopholes in the Clean Water Act, what can a state do to combat cruise ship discharge of sewage and gray water. Ocean & Coastal Law Journal, 9, 99."
