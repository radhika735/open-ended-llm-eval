  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Italy found that restoring connectivity between two wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct, significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHabitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of amphibian populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Restoring corridors of native vegetation between patches of suitable habitat may help to maintain amphibian populations.\nStudies investigating the effects of restoring habitat connectivity with wildlife tunnels are discussed in ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’."
