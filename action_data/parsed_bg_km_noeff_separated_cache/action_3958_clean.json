  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwelve studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands. Seven studies were in Switzerland, three were in the UK, and one was in each of Greece and Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (2 studies): Two replicated studies (including one controlled study and one site comparison study) in Switzerland found that the composition of butterfly communities differed between low-input and intensively managed grasslands. One of these studies found that low-input grasslands tended to have more butterfly species whose caterpillars feed on a single host plant, have one generation/year and poor dispersal ability.\nRichness/diversity (11 studies): Six of 10 studies (including five controlled studies and five site comparison studies) in Switzerland, the UK, Greece and Germany found that less intensively managed grasslands had a higher species richness of butterflies and moths than conventionally managed grasslands, although two of these studies only found a difference in one of two years or regions. The other four studies found that less intensively managed grasslands had a similar species richness of butterflies and moths to conventionally managed grasslands. However, one of these studies also found that less intensively managed grassland had more specialist species of moths, and species of conservation concern, than conventionally managed grassland. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after grazing was reduced and chemical application stopped, the species richness of large moths increased.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Three of four replicated studies (including two controlled studies and two site comparison studies) in Switzerland, the UK and Germany found that low-input or unfertilized, ungrazed grassland managed with a single cut had a higher abundance of butterflies, micro-moths and declining macro-moths than intensively managed grassland. Two of these studies also found that the abundance of caterpillars and of all macro-moths was similar between less intensively and more intensively managed grasslands. The other study found that less intensively managed grassland had a similar abundance of moths to more intensively managed grassland. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after grazing was reduced and chemical application stopped, the total abundance of large moths and the abundance of five out of 23 butterfly species increased, but the abundance of two butterfly species decreased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany reported that 24 out of 58 moth species preferred less intensively managed grasslands, but 12 species preferred more intensively managed grasslands.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntensive, conventional grassland management, with high fertilizer input and regular cutting or grazing, creates species-poor plant communities which in turn result in a lower diversity of butterflies and moths (Marini et al. 2009). Reducing management intensity may, therefore, enable species-rich plant and butterfly and moth communities to recover.\nThis intervention is for studies which look at the effect of a combination of measures to reduce management intensity, including reducing or delaying grazing or mowing, sometimes in combination, and often alongside a reduction or removal of the application of fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides. For individual effects of these actions, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock”, “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland”, “Delay cutting or first grazing date on grasslands to create variation in sward height”, “Pollution – Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally” and “Pollution – Convert to organic farming”.\nMarini L., Fontana P., Battisti A. & Gaston K.J.
