  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of controlling harmful invasive bat prey species on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBats may feed on harmful invasive prey species. For example, ghost bats Macroderma gigas have been reported to eat poisonous invasive cane toads Rhinella marina in Australia, which may have contributed to ghost bat population declines (White et al. 2016).\nWhite A.W., Morris I., Madani G. & Archer M. (2016) Are cane toads Rhinella marina impacting ghost bats Macroderma gigas in Northern Australia? Australian Zoologist, 38, 183–191."
