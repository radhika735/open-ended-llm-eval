  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial caves or hibernacula for bats on bat populations. Two studies were in the UK and two were in Germany.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUptake (1 study): One study in the UK found that the number of bats using an artificial hibernaculum increased in each of nine years after it was built.\nUse (4 studies): One study in the UK found that an artificial cave was used by a small number of brown long-eared bats. Three studies in Germany and the UK found that artificial hibernacula were used by up to four bat species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial caves or hibernacula could be created for bats where natural sites are limited or where these habitats have been lost. Hibernacula would need to be carefully designed to ensure a stable microclimate.\nFor similar interventions, see ‘Provide artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in disturbed caves’ and ‘Provide artificial subterranean bat roosts to replace roosts in reclaimed mines’. Some bat species may also hibernate in bat boxes, which are discussed in ‘Provide bat boxes for roosting bats’."
