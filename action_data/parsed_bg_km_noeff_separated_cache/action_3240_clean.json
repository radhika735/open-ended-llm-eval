  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding inorganic fertilizer to restore or create brackish/salt marshes. The study was in Canada.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in salt-contaminated bogs in Canada found that adding fertilizer had no significant effect on cover of salt marsh vegetation, in unplanted plots, after one year.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFertilizers can be used to manage nutrient availability and may speed up revegetation. Plant growth might be limited by a lack of nutrients overall, or of a specific nutrient, after drainage, mining, vegetation harvest or pollution. When one or two nutrients are overabundant, invasive plant species may benefit more than native species. Adding the less abundant nutrients may shift the competitive balance back towards native species (Tilman et al. 1999; Perry et al. 2004). Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K). It may be sensible to add fertilizer when the focal site is not flooded, to reduce the risk of it dissolving or being washed away.\nThe effects of this action will be heavily dependent on the study context, especially initial site nutrient levels and the amount of fertilizer added. Adding fertilizer when nutrients are already abundant could cause more harm than good, encouraging the growth of undesirable plants or algae and even inhibiting plant growth (Weinbaum et al. 1992). Accordingly, studies testing the effects of nutrient enrichment as a threat (i.e. enrichment above normal or desirable levels) are not summarized as evidence.\nRelated actions: Add inorganic fertilizer to complement planting; Stimulate microbial breakdown of oil, including through fertilization.\nPerry L.G., Galatowitsch S.M. & Rosen C.J.
