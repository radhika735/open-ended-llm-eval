  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting bottom trawling on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Two studies were in the Bering Sea (USA), one in the North Sea, and one in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after, one replicated) in the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that in areas prohibiting trawling for either 15 or 20 years, overall invertebrate community composition was different to that of trawled areas.\nOverall species richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (one paired, one before-and-after, one replicated) in the Bering Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea found that invertebrate diversity was higher in sites closed to trawling compared to trawled sites after either 37 or 15 years, but the other found no differences after 20 years.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies (one paired, one replicated) in the Bering Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that total invertebrate abundance was higher in sites closed to trawling compared to trawled sites after 37 years, but the other found no differences after 20 years. Both found no differences in total invertebrate biomass.\nUnwanted catch overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that during the three years after closing areas to all bottom trawling, unwanted catch of crabs appeared to have decreased, while no changes appeared to have occurred in nearby trawled areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Mobile fishing gear such as bottom trawls are known to be particularly damaging as they are dragged along the seabed. Their use can be stopped or prohibited within an area and only static gears (such as lobster or crab pots/traps) allowed. Ceasing or prohibiting bottom trawling can remove this direct pressure to subtidal benthic invertebrates and potentially allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Hiddink et al. 2017). When this intervention occurs due to the closure of an area to shipping, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – “Cease or prohibit shipping”. When it is in combination with ceasing or prohibiting dredging, but without separating the effects of the two gear, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”. When this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit bottom trawling”.\n \nCollie J.S., Hall S.J., Kaiser M.J. & Poiner I.R.
