  "action_title": "Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA study from the USA found that 35 species of bird used fields with intercropping, with four nesting, but that productivity from the fields was very low.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity and so planting multiple crops may help birds of different functional groups to use a single field."
