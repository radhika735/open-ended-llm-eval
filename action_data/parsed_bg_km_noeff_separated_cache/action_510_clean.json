  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTen out of 11 studies from across the world found that fostering raptor chicks to wild conspecifics had high success rates.\nA single study from the USA found that only one of six eggs fostered to wild bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus nests were hatched and raised. The authors suggest that the other eggs may have been infertile.\nA replicated study from Spain found that Spanish imperial eagle Aquila adalberti chicks were no more likely to survive to fledging if they were transferred to foster nests from three chick broods (at high risk from siblicide), compared to chicks left in three-chick broods.\nA replicated study from Spain found that young (15–20 years old) Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus chicks were successfully adopted, but three older (27–29 day old) chicks were rejected.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNatural variations in reproductive output can be detrimental when populations are very small, for example if pairs fail to produce fertile eggs or some pairs repeatedly fail to raise offspring successfully. One way to minimise this problem is to foster eggs and chicks between nests. Eggs and chicks from nests with more offspring than they are likely to be able to raise can be moved to those with infertile eggs. Alternatively, if a pair produces fertile eggs or healthy chicks but consistently fails to raise chicks then it may be possible to transfer offspring to a more successful pair.\nIn other circumstances it may be possible to foster chicks with other species (‘cross-fostering’). Studies describing this intervention are discussed in the following section ‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering).’"
