  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting vegetation to act as a buffer to exclude pollution on shrublands.\n\n'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanting vegetation adjacent to roads to act as a buffer has been suggested as a way to reduce their impact on surrounding habitats (Spellerberg, 1998). In particular buffer zones may help to reduce the inputs of pollutants from vehicle exhausts to nutrient-poor shrubland ecosystems (Angold, 1997)\nSpellerberg, I. A. N. (1998). Ecological effects of roads and traffic: a literature review. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 7(5), 317-333.\nAngold, P. G. (1997). The impact of a road upon adjacent heathland vegetation: effects on plant species composition. Journal of Applied Ecology, 409-417."
