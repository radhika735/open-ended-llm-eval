  "action_title": "Provide ‘sacrificial’ grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo studies in the UK found that managing grasslands for geese increased the number grazing there. However, both found that the birds were moving within a relatively small area (i.e. within the study sites) and therefore the grasslands may not reduce conflict with farmers.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere have been dramatic increases in many species of goose in recent decades (Madsen et al. 1999) and this has led to increasing conflict with farmers, as many species graze on arable land, potentially ruining crops. One potential solution, to reduce conflict whilst maintaining the populations of geese is to provide ‘sacrificial grasslands’ – areas set-aside for geese to feed on, which keeps them away from agricultural fields.\nTo be useful, such areas need to be more attractive than neighbouring fields. Interventions detailing specific management practices are mainly described in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications’, whilst the studies below describe whether the provision of sacrificial grasslands actually affects the distribution of geese in an area.\nMadsen, J., Cracknell, G. and Fox, A.D.
