  "action_id": "458",
  "action_title": "Use organic rather than mineral fertilisers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of using organic, not mineral, fertilisers on bird populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOrganic fertilisers include farmyard manure and soil treatments derived from sewage sludge, whilst mineral fertilisers are manufactured preparations of nitrate, phosphate or 'NPK'. Organic fertilisers have the potential benefit of contributing to better soil structure and therefore reducing soil erosion, whilst also, potentially reducing the risk of down-stream eutrophication."
