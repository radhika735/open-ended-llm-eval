  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of allowing forest to regenerate naturally following logging. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that, natural forest regeneration increased moose numbers relative to more intensive management in the short- to medium-term but not in the longer term.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAfter logging of forests, cut areas may be left to regenerate naturally or may be subject to management aimed at accelerating tree planting. Allowing natural regeneration may facilitate formation of more natural vegetation which could improve habitat and resource availability for mammals."
