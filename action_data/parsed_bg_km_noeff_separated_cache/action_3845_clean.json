  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing the size of surface features when prospecting for or extracting underground products. This study was in Canada.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that narrow corridors used for prospecting for oil had a lower species richness of butterflies than wide corridors, but were similar to undisturbed forest.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that narrow corridors used for prospecting for oil had a lower abundance of butterflies than wide corridors, but were similar to undisturbed forest.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nProspecting for underground products, such as oil and gas, can require the destruction of habitat on the surface. Minimizing the footprint of these operations may reduce the disturbance to sensitive species. Note that smaller individual disturbances may require more patches of disturbance across the landscape, and therefore may not reduce the total area disturbed (Riva et al. 2018).\nRiva F., Acorn J.H. & Nielsen S.E. (2018) Localized disturbances from oil sands developments increase butterfly diversity and abundance in Alberta's boreal forests. Biological Conservation, 217, 173–180."
