  "action_title": "Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of storks and ibises",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated study and a review of northern bald ibis Geronticus eremita release programmes in Europe and the Middle East found that only one of four had resulted in a wild population being established or supported, with many birds dying or dispersing, rather than forming stable colonies.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc)."
