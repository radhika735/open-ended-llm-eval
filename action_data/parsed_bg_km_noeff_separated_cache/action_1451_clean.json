  "action_title": "Minimize ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOpen cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow pit. Walls of the pit are generally blast mined, creating ground vibrations and resulting in dust generation and water, air, and noise pollution. Although we are not aware of any studies evaluating the effect of open cast mining on primates specifically, one study found that species richness was higher at the site that was more distant from the mine and that species composition and characteristics of animal calls differed between the two sites, suggesting that blasting may influence vocal communication in animals and negatively affect wildlife populations (Duarte et al. 2015). Minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining can help to reduce pollution and lessen stress levels in resident primate populations.\n \nDuarte M.H.L., Sousa-Lima R.S., Young R.J., Farina A., Vasconcelos M., Rodrigues M. & Pieretti N.
