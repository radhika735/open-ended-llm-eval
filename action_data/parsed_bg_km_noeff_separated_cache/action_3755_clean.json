  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring wetlands on reptile populations. Six studies were in the USA and one was in Kenya.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA found that reptile species richness and diversity tended to be lower in a restored wetland compared to an undisturbed wetland. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that created, restored, enhanced and natural wetlands had similar combined reptile and amphibian species richness. One site comparison study in the USA found that created wetlands and adjacent natural forest had similar reptile species richness and diversity.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One site comparison study in the USA found that a created wetland was used by snapping turtles for egg laying. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA found that in a restored wetland, 16 snake, six lizard and eight turtle species successfully reproduced.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): One site comparison study and three before-and-after studies (including one replicated study) in the USA and Kenya found that created or restored wetlands were used by black rat snakes and snapping turtles, turtles, lizards, green grass snakes and terrapins, six or 18 reptile species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLoss and degradation of wetlands are a major factor contributing to the global decline in reptiles (Gibbons et al. 2000). Many wetlands have been drained and altered to allow for agricultural and urban development. Creating new or restoring wetlands may replace some of the habitat lost and therefore help to maintain and increase populations of reptile species that rely on wetlands.\nCreating wetlands for wildlife may involve excavating holes in the ground and damming streams (Adams & Saenz 2011) and bespoke design and planning of different wetland zones, water depths and nutrient flows (Mitsch et al. 1998). Restoring wetlands may involve tree planting, vegetation management to optimise shading and provide basking sites, and/or water flow management.\nStudies investigating the creation of individual ponds or waterways are discussed in Create or restore ponds and Create or restore waterways.\nAdams C.K. & Saenz D.
