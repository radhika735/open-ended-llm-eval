  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of controlling problematic plants in freshwater marshes or swamps using &gt;3 combined interventions. The study was in Costa Rica.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that coverage of live vegetation stands was lower in a plot where southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years than in a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\nOverall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had greater plant species richness than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had less live vegetation cover than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers control of problematic plants using &gt;3 separate interventions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single specific intervention. Where three or fewer interventions have been used together in a study, it is included as evidence for each intervention elsewhere in the synopsis (whilst explicitly noting the use of multiple interventions in each summary paragraph).\nFor this section, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized."
