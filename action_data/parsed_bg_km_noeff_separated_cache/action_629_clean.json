  "action_title": "Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of parrots",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA before-and-after study from Venezuela found that the local population of yellow-shouldered amazons Amazona barbadensis increased significantly following the release of captive-bred birds, along with other interventions.\nA replicated study in Costa Rica and Peru found high survival and some breeding of scarlet macaw Ara macao after release.\nThree replicated studies in the USA, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico found low survival in released birds (4–41% in the first year after release), although the Puerto Rican study also found that released birds bred successfully.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.\nRelease techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc)."
