  "action_title": "Use a different bait type: Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using a different bait type on tortoise, terrapin, side-necked and softshell turtles. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nUnwanted catch (2 studies): One randomized, controlled study in the USA found that a crab pot with mackerel bait caught more diamondback terrapins than when chicken bait or no bait was used. One replicated, paired study in the USA found that hoop nets with soap bait caught fewer turtles than nets with cheese bait.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing alternative bait that is less attractive to marine and freshwater reptiles may reduce entanglement and capture of reptiles in fishing gear. Losses to fishers may also be reduced thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for: Sea turtles, Snakes & lizards or Crocodilians.\nSee also: Use dyed bait and Change hook baiting technique."
