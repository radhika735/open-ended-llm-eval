  "action_title": "Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species, but not abundance, were significantly higher in plots with mechanical understory reduction compared to those without.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRemoving vegetation can be used as a substitute for prescribed fire to eliminate competing mid-storey or ground vegetation. Although this technique does not have the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire, it has advantages, such as increased selectivity and decreased risk of offsite fire damage.\nOther studies that control mid-storey or ground vegetation are discussed in ‘Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation’."
