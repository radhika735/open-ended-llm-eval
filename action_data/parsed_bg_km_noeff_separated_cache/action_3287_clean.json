  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in brackish/saline wetlands before planting emergent, non-woody plants. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuarine salt marsh in the USA found that amongst plots sown/planted with dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii, those that had been excavated into depressions had lower cover of dominant pickleweed Salicornia virginica – over the first growing season – than plots left at ground level.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nGermination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuarine salt marsh in the USA found that there were no more (sometimes fewer) dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii seedlings in excavated depressions than in level plots, two months after sowing saltwort seeds.\n\n\nSurvival (1 study): The same study found that the survival rate of dwarf saltwort Salicornia bigelovii transplants was not greater (sometimes lower) in excavated depressions than in level plots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves creating discrete mounds (e.g. by adding blocks of soil, bundles of sticks, other coarse woody debris) or hollows (e.g. by excavation) before planting marsh or swamp vegetation. The scale of this action falls somewhere between reprofiling/relandscaping (large-scale landscape features, tens of metres wide) and disturbing the ground surface (which may create small scale mounds or hollows, millimetres or a few centimetres wide/deep).\nOften, this action aims to mimic the natural microtopography of marshes or swamps, which can be created by sediment accumulation, erosion, tree fall, root growth or animal activity (Vivian-Smith 1997, Bruland & Richardson 2005). Microtopography can increase plant diversity, because the different microclimates or microelevations may support different species (Vivian-Smith 1997). Planting into mounds can be useful if seedlings would otherwise be flooded too deeply or for too long (Zamith & Scarano 2010). Large woody debris will also add nutrients and organic matter to a site as it decomposes.\nStudies that examine the effects of planting into existing microtopographic features (e.g. mounds), even if they compare effects between different kinds of features, are not summarized as evidence here (e.g. Raulings et al. 2007; Sleeper & Ficklin 2016).\nRelated actions: Create mounds or hollows, other than to complement planting; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting without creating discrete mounds and/or hollows.\nBruland G.L. & Richardson C.J.
