  "action_title": "Parrot’s feather: Biological control using plant pathogens",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in South Africa found that parrot’s feather plants survived after being treated with a strain of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlant pathogens have been used to control invasive aquatic plants by inducing plant mortality (Charudattan 2001). The introduction of pathogens may impact non-target species and therefore in-depth studies investigating possible undesired consequences should be undertaken prior to the application of any plant pathogen. The use of fungal-based herbicides to control parrot’s feather is discussed under ‘Biological control using fungal-based herbicides’ and the use of herbivores for the biocontrol of control parrot’s feather is discussed under ‘Biological control using herbivores’\n \nCharudattan, R. (2001). Biological control of weeds by means of plant pathogens: significance for integrated weed management in modern agro-ecology. BioControl, 46, 229-260."
