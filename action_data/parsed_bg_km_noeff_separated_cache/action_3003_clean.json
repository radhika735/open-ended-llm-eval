  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of harvest in freshwater swamps (or harvesting at different intensities). The study was in China.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nHerb abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater swamp in China reported that overall herb biomass was statistically similar in plots logged at different intensities five years previously.\nTree/shrub abundance (1 study): The same study reported that overall tree biomass was greatest in plots logged at the lowest intensity five years previously. In contrast, overall shrub biomass was greatest in plots logged at medium intensity.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that the density of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nDiameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater swamp in China reported that the diameter of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity.\nBasal area (1 study): The same study reported that the basal area of the two most common tree species typically declined with increasing logging intensity.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHarvesting vegetation less intensely may increase its capacity to recover. Harvesting a smaller area or removing fewer plants leaves a larger population of plants to grow or spread into harvested gaps. Removing less of each plant might avoid killing them and allow them to regrow. Techniques such as selective harvesting, thinning rather than clear-cutting, and patch retention harvesting are all included within this action. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.\nNote that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any intensity, are not summarized as evidence for this action.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest."
