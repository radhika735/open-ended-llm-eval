  "action_title": "Re-seed grasslands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne of two studies, both from the UK and investigating grazing by geese Branta spp., found that geese grazed at higher densities on grasslands that were re-seeded, compared to control or fertilised areas.\nOne study found that areas sown with clover were grazed at higher densities than those sown with grass seed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRe-seeding grasslands may improve productivity and the growth of young grass, which in turn may increase the number of birds it can support. This intervention is sometimes used to attract geese to specific areas to reduce conflict with farmers, when geese graze their crops. See ‘Provide sacrificial grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops’ for details.\nRe-seeding can be with grass species, or with legumes such as clover Trifolium spp. which may improve the nitrogen content of the forage."
