  "action_id": "259",
  "action_title": "Mowing roadside verges",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA single replicated, controlled study in the USA found that more ducks nested on unmown roadside verges, but that over four years, nesting success on unmown verges fell to below that on mown verges.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRoadside verges could potentially act as a valuable nesting or foraging habitat for many species of birds, but can become overgrown with rank vegetation. Mowing, therefore, may increase the value of this habitat.\nAlternatively, conservationists may want to limit the number of birds using roads verges, to reduce the risk of collisions with vehicles."
