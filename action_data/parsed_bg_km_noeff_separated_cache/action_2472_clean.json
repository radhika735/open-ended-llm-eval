  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of placing captive young mammals with captive foster parents. One study was in the USA and one was in Sweden and Norway.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that most captive coyote pups placed with foster parents were successfully reared. A replicated study in Sweden and Norway found that captive grey wolf pups placed with foster parents had higher survival rates than pups that stayed with their biological mother.\nCondition (1 study): A replicated study in Sweden and Norway found that captive grey wolf pups placed with foster parents weighed less than pups that stayed with their biological mother.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSuccess of captive breeding programmes for endangered mammal species may be reduced if the biological parents are unable to rear any or all of their young. This may occur when there are more young than parents can rear, or through disease, injury or death of the parents. One option may be to place the young with captive foster parents of the same species, where such animals are available. This may reduce the risk of the young becoming imprinted on humans (which could occur if they were hand reared) and so could increase their chance of survival after release into the wild.\nStudies reported on here are examples of where this action is carried out in an experimental way, but where the results could help inform actions in future programmes.\nSee also Hand-rear orphaned or abandoned young in captivity, Place orphaned or abandoned wild young with captive foster parents and Place orphaned or abandoned wild young with wild foster parents."
