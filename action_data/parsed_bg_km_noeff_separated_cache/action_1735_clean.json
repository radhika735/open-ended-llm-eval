  "action_title": "Reduce intensity of livestock grazing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of reducing livestock grazing intensity. This study was in bogs.\nVegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower. Cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower (one species) or unaffected by grazing intensity (one species).\nVegetation structure (1 study): The same study found that vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis section considers the effects of reducing the intensity of grazing, but not completely removing livestock from peatlands. Grazing intensity could be reduced by letting fewer animals graze, allowing them to graze for fewer days (rotational or seasonal grazing), providing supplementary food as an alternative to living plants and/or encouraging use of alternative sites (e.g. through placement of feeding stations or shelter).\nDomestic livestock directly consume peatland vegetation, destroy peatland vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), and affect nutrient balance through excretion (Lindsay et al. 2014). Lower intensity grazing may have less of an impact and may maintain a more desirable plant community (Middleton et al. 2006). Plant groups or species that are most affected by trampling or are selectively grazed (Grant et al. 1987) could to recover to more desirable levels. Maintaining some grazing may prevent any one species from becoming over-abundant.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: completely remove livestock from degraded peatlands; low intensity grazing as a traditional or novel conservation tool.\nGrant S.A., Suckling S.A., Smith H.K., Torvell L., Forbes T.D.A. & Hodgson J.
