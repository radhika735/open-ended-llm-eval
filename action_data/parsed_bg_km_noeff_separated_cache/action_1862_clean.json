  "action_title": "Amphibians: Identify and breed a similar species to refine husbandry techniques prior to working with target species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo small, replicated interlinked studies in BrazilÂ found that working with a less-threatened surrogate species of frog first to establish husbandry interventions promoted successful breeding of a critically endangered species of frog.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding techniques and correct husbandry have only been developed for a relatively small number of amphibian species. It is sometimes necessary to trial husbandry interventions on similar species, which are less threatened in the wild, before trying to breed more challenging and higher risk species."
