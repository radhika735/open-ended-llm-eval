  "action_title": "Eliminate fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of eliminating fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFisheries subsidies are direct or indirect financial transfers by the government of a country to its fishing sector, usually to help offset the cost or increase in cost of a critical resource such as fuel, fishing gear or new vessels (Sumaila et al. 2008). It is argued these payments may drive overexploitation of fish populations by providing an economic incentive to continue fishing even when stocks are declining. They may also benefit illegal fishing activities. The elimination of harmful fisheries subsidies may help control fishing effort and prevent declines in fish populations due to fishing.\nSumaila U.R., Teh L., Watson R., Tyedmers P. & Pauly D. (2008) Fuel price increase, subsidies, overcapacity, and resource sustainability. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65, 832–840."
