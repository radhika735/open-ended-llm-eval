  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring grasslands on reptile populations. One study was in each of South Africa, China, Australia and the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Mongolia found that areas of restored grassland had similar species richness compared to unrestored areas. One replicated, site comparison study in South Africa found that an area of restored grassland had lower species richness than natural grassland in three of four comparisons.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (including one paired study) in Mongolia and the USA found that areas of restored grassland had higher lizard abundance than unrestored areas. The other study found that areas of restored grassland had fewer snakes than unrestored areas. One replicated, site comparison study in South Africa found that an area of restored grassland had a similar abundance of reptiles compared to two areas of natural grassland.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that some areas of restored grassland and rocky outcrops were recolonized by pink-tailed worm-lizards.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany grasslands have been lost to agricultural intensification through conversion to cropland or through agricultural abandonment, which may result in colonization by scrub or woodland. Agri-environment schemes in Europe and North America support the preservation or restoration of grasslands for agricultural, conservation and carbon storage reasons. Restoration of these grasslands may benefit some reptile species that are associated with them.\nSee also: Create or restore savannas."
