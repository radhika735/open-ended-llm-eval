  "action_title": "Maintain forest and woodland edges for foraging bats",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of maintaining forest and woodland edges for foraging bats on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEdge habitats are important for foraging bats. A study in North America found higher activity of six bat species along forest edges than forest interiors in both unmanaged and thinned forest (Morris et al. 2010).\nMorris A.D., Miller D.A. & Kalcounis-Rueppell M.C. (2010) Use of forest edges by bats in a managed pine forest landscape. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 74, 26–34."
