  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight of 14 studies (including three randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, North America and the USA found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species. Four found that forest fires had mixed effects on amphibian abundance depending on species, species and year or season of burn. Three found that fires increased amphibian abundance or numbers of species. One found that abundance decreased with fires.\nTwo studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled study) in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance increased or abundance decreased with time since prescribed forest fires.\nOne before-and-after study in the USA found that spotted salamander hatching success increased following a prescribed forest fire.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPrescribed fires are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel to attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging 'wildfires'. They may also be used in the maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional ‘wildfires’ that have been suppressed through management.\nIn forests, fires may remove large amounts of woody material from the understory and result in increased grasses and herbaceous vegetation. Such changes can affect forest amphibians. For example, one study found that frog and toad species richness was not affected by the interval between fires, but six species showed some response to the number of fires at the site (Westgate et al. 2012).\nWestgate M.J., Driscoll D.A. & Lindenmayer D.B. (2012) Can the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and information on species traits predict anuran responses to fire? Oikos, 121, 1516–1524."
