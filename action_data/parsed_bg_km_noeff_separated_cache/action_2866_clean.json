Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSewage sludge is the residual, semi-solid material produced as a by-product during sewage treatment. Sewage sludge can be disposed of at sea or in rivers and may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria and viruses, heavy metals, and chemicals. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the dumping of sewage sludge in an area may reduce the risk of contaminating marine and freshwater mammals and their habitats."
