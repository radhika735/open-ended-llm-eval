  "action_title": "Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of using both lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict (2 studies): Two replicated paired sites, controlled studies (one also randomized), in the USA, found that frightening devices, emitting lights and sound, did not reduce crop intrusions by white-tailed deer or food consumption by elk and mule deer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention specifically refers to use of light and sound in combination, typically delivered via a commercially-produced product designed to deter visits by wild mammals. If successful, such an intervention could reduce crop damage and, thus, reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of herbivores.\nSee also: Use light/lasers to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict, Use loud noises to deter crop damage (e.g. banger sticks, drums, tins, iron sheets) by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Use noise aversive conditioning to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict."
