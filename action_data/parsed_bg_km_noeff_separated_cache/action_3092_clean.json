  "action_title": "Physically remove problematic plants: brackish/salt marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically removing problematic plants from brackish/salt marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nNative/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in pepperweed invaded marshes in the USA found that physically removing pepperweed from plots sprayed with herbicide increased cover of native plants, over the following two years, compared to spraying with herbicide only.\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): The same study quantified the effect of this action on the cover of individual plant species, other than the target of control (see original paper for data).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action considers complete physical removal of problematic plants, i.e. pulling up or digging up entire plants, or scraping living vegetation from the marsh surface. Removal may be targeted to individual organisms, or applied to the whole plant community. The most appropriate removal method will depend on the species to be removed, and the site conditions (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016).\nIf plants are completely removed, including roots where applicable, immediate regrowth will be prevented (although long-term recolonization from the seed bank or from neighbouring sites is possible). For some species, disposing of the problem plants off-site may help to prevent regrowth, but disposal should be done carefully to avoid causing an invasion elsewhere (Stevens et al. 1997).\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Remove surface soil/sediment, including any plants on it.\nStevens K.J., Peterson R.L. & Stephenson G.R.
