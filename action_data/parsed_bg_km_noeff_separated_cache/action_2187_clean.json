  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of locating aquaculture systems in already impacted areas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). By locating aquaculture systems in areas that already have poor water quality (for instance due to sewage outfall), the source of pollution is restricted to that already impacted zone. This may potentially relieve other areas from additional pollution, without significantly further degrading the already impacted area which likely already holds an impacted subtidal benthic invertebrate community.\nEvidence for other interventions related to the relocation of aquaculture activities are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate aquaculture systems in locations with fast currents”, “Locate aquaculture systems in vegetated areas”, and “Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems (and vice versa) to act as biofilters”.\n \nWu R.S.S., Lam K.S., MacKay D.W., Lau T.C. & Yam V.
