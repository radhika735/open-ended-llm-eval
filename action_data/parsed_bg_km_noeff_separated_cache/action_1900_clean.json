  "action_title": "Carnivores: Feed commercially prepared diets",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that providing a commercial diet to maned wolves led to similar dry matter intake and digestibility despite having a lower protein content.\nOne replicated, randomized study of African wildcats in the USA found that feeding a commercial diet decreased crude protein digestibility and increased food intake and faecal output compared to raw meat. One controlled study of African wildcats in the USA found lower organic matter digestibility compared to a ground-chicken diet.\nOne replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that cheetahs fed a commercial diet had a similar likelihood of developing gastritis as those fed horse meat, lower levels of blood protein urea but higher levels of creatine. One study in USA found that cheetahs fed a commercial meat diet or whole chicken carcasses had plasma a-tocopherol, retinol and taurine concentrations within the ranges recommended for domestic cats.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNutritional requirements of many exotic species are often unknown and therefore are commonly based on the nearest domestic relative. However, felids and canids typically eat many different parts of carcasses in the wild. Therefore, feeding a commercial diet may reduce the health risks to keepers and animals compared to handling raw meat but may not meet the nutritional needs of the animal. Identifying the digestibility and faecal or blood nutrient content may indicate the appropriateness of the diet in reference to the digestive health of the animal."
