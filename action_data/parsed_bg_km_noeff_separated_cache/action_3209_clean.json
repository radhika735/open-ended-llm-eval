  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange to restore/create brackish/saline swamps from other land uses or habitat types. One study was in Australia and one was in Thailand.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY                             \n\nOverall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in an estuary in Australia reported that the area of mangrove forest on an island was greater 3–9 years after restoring full tidal exchange than in the years before.\nTree/shrub richness/diversity (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove tree species that spontaneously colonized in the six years after restoring full tidal exchange (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nIndividual species abundance (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove trees, by species, that spontaneously colonized in the six years after restoring full tidal exchange (along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action includes actions that facilitate tidal exchange, in order to restore or create swamps from other land uses. The action may be a single permanent one (e.g. breaching sea walls or embankments, installing or widening culverts, excavating tidal creeks) or a reversible one (e.g. opening sluice gates once per day). However, the intervention must affect an area that does not retain substantial characteristics of the target habitat. This could be an upland area (e.g. the thousands of square kilometres of farmland that has been reclaimed from salt marsh in the Netherlands since the Middle Ages; Wolff 1992), an unvegetated wetland (e.g. mudflats), or a wetland other than the target type (e.g. marsh, where the habitat used to be a swamp). “Planned retreat” and “managed realignment” fall within the scope of this action.\nTidal wetlands may be brackish/saline (e.g. mangroves, coastal marshes) or freshwater (e.g. at the upstream end of estuaries, as in the Mississippi, Yangtze, and Elbe rivers; Baldwin et al. 2009). Studies of accidental realignment, such as when coastal defences are breached by a storm, have not been summarized as evidence (e.g. Onaindia et al. 2001; some sites in Williams & Orr 2002).\nRelated actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded swamps; Reprofile/relandscape or Remove surface soil/sediment, both of which can alter patterns of tidal exchange; Facilitate tidal exchange to complement planting.\nBaldwin A.H., Barendregt A. & Whigham D.
