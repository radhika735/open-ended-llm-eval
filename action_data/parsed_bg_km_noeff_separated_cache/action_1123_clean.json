  "action_title": "Floating pennywort: Biological control using co-evolved, host specific herbivores",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated laboratory and field study in South America found that the South American weevil caused more feeding lesions on floating pennywort than on any other plant species, but field results found that the weevil did not reduce floating pennywort biomass.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOne-off introduction of a co-evolved, host-specific species from the area of origin of the invasive pest can potentially provide sustainable control without affecting non-target native plants.  For example, a laboratory study in Argentina, found that the South American weevil Listronotus elongatus appears host specific on floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, exhibiting both feeding and reproductive behaviour (Cordo et al. 1982).  Observations have also been reported of extensive damage caused by this same weevil to floating pennywort (Newman & Duenas 2010).  In addition, observations in Germany showed that the introduced Coypus Myocastor coypus can eat floating pennywort (Hussner & Lösch 2007).\nCordo, H.
