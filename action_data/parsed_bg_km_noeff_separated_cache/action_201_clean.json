  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA before-and-after study in the UK found that more barnacle geese Branta leucopsis used a site after the amount of land used to grow cereals was reduced and other interventions were used.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFarmland heterogeneity is thought to be key in determining on-farm biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003). Therefore, increasing the range of different crops grown in a given year may increase the biological value of a farm.\nBenton, T.G., Vickery, J.A. & Wilson, J.D., 2003. Farmland biodiversity: is habitat heterogeneity the key? Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, 182â€“188."
