  "action_title": "Create artificial wetlands to reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating artificial wetlands to reduce effluent reaching rivers and the sea on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAgricultural and forestry effluents, which may contain chemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients, solid particles, and sediment, can enter rivers and other watercourses, and be discharged into the sea. Artificial wetlands may be created with the aim of retaining such pollution. For example, solid particles and sediment may sink in areas of slow water flow and plants growing on wetlands may remove excess nutrients (Brix 1994). Creating artificial wetlands near agricultural lands or forestry plantations may reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.\nBrix H.
