  "action_title": "Provide supplementary food to allow the rescue of a second chick",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA small controlled study in Spain found that second chicks from lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus nests survived longer if nests were provided with food, allowing one chick to be rescued.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany vultures and birds of prey lay more eggs each year than they can raise, with the final chick hatching several days after the first. This chick will always be weaker and is almost always killed by its siblings or starves to death as it cannot compete for food. It is thought that this chick acts as ‘insurance’ in case the older chicks die.\nIn very rare species, it may be beneficial to ‘rescue’ the younger chick, but doing so can be difficult. It is possible that providing extra food will allow the yonger chick to survive for long enough for a rescue attempt to be mounted."
