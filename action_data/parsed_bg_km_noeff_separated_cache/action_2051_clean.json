  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of creating grassland on bat populations. The study was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the UK found that pipistrelle activity (relative abundance) did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and improved pasture or crop fields on conventional farms.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGrassland provides an important foraging habitat for many bat species, particularly unimproved or semi-unimproved species-rich grassland that has not been intensively grazed, drained or treated with artificial fertilisers or herbicides. Management of grassland may involve a combination of interventions that involve specific mowing or grazing regimes and reduced inputs.\nA study that involves the restoration of grassland alongside other habitats at ex-quarry sites is described in ‘Restore bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites’."
