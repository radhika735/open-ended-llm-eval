  "action_title": "Primates: Feed individuals separately",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured for the effects of feeding individual primates separately\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome primate species lead solitary largely lives in the wild but are normally housed in pairs or social groups in captivity where they may experience feeding competition. In captivity, training, feeding devices or enclosure modifications may allow group-housed primates to forage individually."
