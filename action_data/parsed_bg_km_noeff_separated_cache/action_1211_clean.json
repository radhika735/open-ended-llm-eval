  "action_title": "Thin trees within forests: effects on understory plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeventeen of 25 studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Spain and the USA found that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants. Seven studies found no effect or mixed effects. One study found a decrease in the abundance of herbaceous species.\nThirteen of 19 studies (including 10 replicated, randomized, controlled studies) in Argentina, Canada, Sweden, the USA and West Africa found that thinning trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants. Seven studies found no effect.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is the removal of trees to control the development or enhance the future condition of a forest, by adjusting its density, structure and species composition.\nStudies looking at tree removal with the aim of removing biomass are discussed in 'Logging/tree removal within forest'."
