  "action_id": "3596",
  "action_title": "Regulate artificial lighting during vulnerable periods",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of regulating artificial lighting during vulnerable periods.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nArtificial lighting may have a negative impact on a range of reptile species (Perry & Fisher 2006). Seasonal reduction of lighting to coincide with vulnerable periods, such as turtle breeding times, has been suggested as a conservation intervention, although, in practice, public safety considerations may often preclude action (Bertolotti & Salmon, 2015).\nSee also: Enforce compliance to lighting regulations.\nBertolotti L. & Salmon M. (2005) Do embedded roadway lights protect sea turtles? Environmental Management, 36, 702–10.\nPerry G. & Fisher R.N. (2006) Night lights and reptiles: observed and potential effects. Pages 169–191 in: C. Rich & T. Longcore (eds.) Ecological consequences of artificial night lighting. Island Press, Washington D.C."
