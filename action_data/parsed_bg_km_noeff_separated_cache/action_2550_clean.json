  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing vegetation by hand or machine. Eleven studies were in the USA, and one each was in Canada, South Africa, Israel, Norway, Portugal, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Thailand.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that mechanically clearing trees within woodland reduced small mammal diversity.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (11 studies): Eight of 11 site comparison or controlled studies (nine of which were replicated), in the USA, Israel, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, found that clearing woody vegetation or herbaceous and grassland vegetation benefitted target mammals. Population or density increases were recorded for small mammals, European rabbits and Stephens’ kangaroo rat while black-tailed prairie dog and California ground squirrel colonies were larger or denser and Utah prairie dog colonies established better than in uncleared areas. Two studies found mixed results of clearing woody vegetation, with hazel dormouse abundance declining, then increasing and small mammal abundance increasing, then declining in both cleared and uncleared plots alike. One study found no effect of scrub clearance from sand dunes on habitat specialist small mammals.\nSurvival (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that mechanical disturbance of woody vegetation within forest (combined with reseeding, follow-up herbicide application and further seeding) increased overwinter survival of mule deer fawns.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (8 STUDIES)\n\nUse (8 studies): Four of seven studies (of which six were site comparisons or controlled), in the USA, Canada, Norway, France and Thailand, found that areas cleared of woody vegetation or herbaceous and grassland vegetation were utilized more by mule deer, reindeer, mouflon and gaur. One study found that clearing woody vegetation promoted increased use by white-tailed deer in some but not all plots, one found that it did not increase use by mule deer and one found that carrying out a second clearance on previously cleared plots did not increase use by white-tailed deer. A before-and-after study in South Africa found that clearing woody vegetation from shrubland increased wildebeest and zebra abundance following subsequent burning but not when carried out without burning whilst other mammals did not show consistent responses.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRegular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in early-successional habitats. Removal of vegetation may help to maintain habitats in an early-successional state, which may benefit mammal species that depend on such habitats.\nThis intervention includes removal of annual vegetation (e.g. herbs and grasses removed by mowing) as well as scrubby vegetation and trees. Tree clearance studies included here are those where woodland had colonised previously open areas and was cleared for conservation purposes, without being part of commercial forest management. For studies of partial clearance in long-established or commercially managed forest, see Biological Resource Use - Clear or open patches in forests."
