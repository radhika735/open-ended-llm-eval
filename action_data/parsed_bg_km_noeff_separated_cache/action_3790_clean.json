  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of fencing cliff edges to prevent individuals from falling. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that after installing a fence along a small cliff edge, fewer green turtle carcasses were found at the base of the cliff compared to before installation.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInstalling fencing along cliff edges in areas frequently used by reptiles may reduce the risk of individuals falling from cliffs.
