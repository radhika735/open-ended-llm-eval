  "action_title": "Use different bait species for fishing that are less attractive to mammals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using different bait species for fishing that are less attractive to mammals on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing alternative bait species that are less attractive to marine and freshwater mammals may reduce entanglement and capture of mammals in fishing gear. Losses to fishers may also be reduced thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict and the motivation to use lethal or harmful deterrents."
