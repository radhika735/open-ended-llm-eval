  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was found for use of mats placed on the bottom of a water body to control water primrose.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUse of mats placed on the bottom of a water body may provide a mechanism for control of small localised populations of water primrose Ludwigia spp.  A study reported a successful attempt to eradicate a different species, swamp stonecrop Crassula helmsii, from small localised areas using mats comprising of black plastic sheeting (Leach & Dawson 1999).\nLeach, J. & Dawson, H. (1999) Crassula helmsii in the British Isles – an unwelcome invader. British Wildlife, 10, 234-239."
