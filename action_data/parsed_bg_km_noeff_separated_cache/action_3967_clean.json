  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of delaying cutting or first grazing dates on grasslands. Two studies were in Germany and one was in each of the UK, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria and Sweden.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Austria found that the community composition of butterflies and day-flying moths was different between early-mown and late-mown grasslands.\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): One of three replicated, controlled studies (including two randomized studies and two paired studies) in the UK, Germany and Switzerland found that, in one of four years, grassland plots cut once/year in July had a higher species richness of butterflies than plots cut once/year in May. One study found that, in one of three years, grassland strips mulched once/year in September had a lower species richness of butterflies than strips mown once/year after 10 June. The third study found that meadows mown 1–2 times/year after 15 July had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to meadows mown twice/year after 15 June.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (6 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (6 studies): Three of four replicated, controlled studies (including three randomized studies and three paired studies) in the UK, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland found that grassland cut once/year in July or September had a greater abundance of butterflies, burnet moths and caterpillars than grassland cut once or twice per year in May or June, but in two of the cases only in one of four or two of three years. The fourth study found that meadows mown once/year in September had a similar abundance of scarce large blue butterflies to meadows mown once/year in May, and abundance remained stable in September-mown meadows but decreased over time in May-mown meadows. One site comparison study in Germany found that a meadow mown once/year after the flight season of tufted marbled skipper had a lower density of eggs than a meadow mown before the flight season. One replicated, site comparison study in Sweden found that meadows where grazing commenced after 15 June (together with a lower stocking density) had a higher abundance of clouded Apollo butterflies than meadows where grazing commenced before 15 June (together with a higher stocking density).\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Austria found that short-tailed blue showed a preference for late-mown meadows, but marbled white and meadow brown preferred early-mown meadows.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCutting or grazing are important management techniques for maintaining grassland habitats, but both represent a threat to butterflies and moths through either direct mortality or damage to food plants. However, alterations to the timing of management to when species are less vulnerable or need fewer resources (e.g. during the pupal phase) may be important for creating the optimal habitat conditions, in terms of structural variation, host plant abundance or quality (Goodenough & Sharp 2016), or the abundance of host species such as ants (Grill et al. 2008).\nFor other changes to grazing regimes on productive grasslands, see “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock” and “Use rotational grazing”. For other changes to mowing techniques or timing in productive grasslands, see “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland”, “Use rotational mowing”, “Raise cutting height on grasslands”, “Use motor bar mowers rather than rotary mowers”. For studies on using mowing to manage wild or semi-natural grasslands, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Change mowing regime on grassland”.\nGoodenough A.E. & Sharp M.H.
