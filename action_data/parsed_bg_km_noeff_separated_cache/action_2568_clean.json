  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating savannas. One study was in Senegal and one was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, randomized, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that restoring savannas by removing trees increased small mammal diversity.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): A study in Senegal found that in a population of dorcas gazelle translocated into a fenced enclosure where vegetation had been restored, births outnumbered deaths. A replicated, randomized, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that restoring savannas by removing trees did not, in most cases, change small mammal abundance.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThrough under-grazing or burning suppression, savannah vegetation can revert to denser scrubland. Restoring savanna may benefit mammals typically associated with the habitat.\nSee also: Restore or create grassland."
