  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of drill seeding rather than sowing by hand on grassland vegetation. The studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were paired) in the USA found that sowing seeds with a seed drill did not alter plant species richness. The other study found mixed effects.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (4 STUDIES)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (3 studies): One of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were randomized and one paired) in the USA found that sowing seeds with a seed drill increased the density of two sown grass species compared to sowing by hand. The two other studies found that in most cases sowing seeds with a seed drill led to no change or a reduction in the abundance of sown plants compared to hydroseeding or sowing by hand.\nGrass abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing grassland seeds with a seed drill increased the abundance of warm-season grass species compared to sowing by hand.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSeed-drilling is the sowing of seeds in uniform rows to a standard soil depth (Bufton 1978). This is usually done with the aid of specialized machinery called a seed drill. Sowing at depth rather than sowing seeds by hand on the soil’s surface may reduce seed removal by seed predators, such as birds. Rolling after sowing with seed drills may allow light to reach seeds to allow germination.\nBufton, L. (1978) The influence of seed-drill design on the spatial arrangement of seedlings and on seedling emergence. Symposium on the Timing of Field vegetable Production, 72."
