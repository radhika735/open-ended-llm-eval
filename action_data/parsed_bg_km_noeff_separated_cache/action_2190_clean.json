  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of mooring aquaculture cages so they move in response to changing current direction on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Instead of mooring a cage in a fixed position, cages can be moored so they move in response to changes in currents. This may help disperse and dilute the accumulation of wastes and organic matter from fish food and faeces, thereby reducing the pollution levels in the area (Goudey et al. 2001; Sarà et al. 2006).\n \nGoudey C.A., Loverich G., Kite-Powell H. & Costa-Pierce B.A. (2001) Mitigating the environmental effects of mariculture through single-point moorings (SPMs) and drifting cages.
