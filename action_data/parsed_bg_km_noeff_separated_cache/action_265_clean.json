  "action_title": "Mark power lines to reduce incidental bird mortality",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA total of eight studies and two literature reviews from across the world found that marking power lines led to significant reductions in collision rates or dangerous flight behaviour (i.e. approaching close to power lines) in cranes Grus spp., mute swans Cygnus olor and other bird species. \nAll markers except thin, black plastic strips or neoprene crosses were effective, with no differences in effectiveness between Bird Flight Diverters (BFDs: brightly coloured plastic spirals) and static fibreglass plates and only a small possible difference between BFDs and ‘flappers’ (moving markers).",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBirds may fly into power lines accidentally, either because they do not see them at all, or because they see them too late to react; this is a particular issue for large species that cannot change direction quickly. Increasing power line visibility by marking them is therefore frequently proposed as a way of reducing collision-induced mortalities without the need to remove earth wires or bury transmission wires."
