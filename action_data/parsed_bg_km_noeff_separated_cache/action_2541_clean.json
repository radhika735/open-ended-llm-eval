  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of establishing riparian buffers.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUncultivated strips of vegetation at the edge of waterways are often used to help reduce pollution entering the water within agricultural and forestry systems. These buffer strips may, therefore, help to enhance environmental quality for aquatic and semi-aquatic mammal species.\nSee also: Biological resource use - Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest."
