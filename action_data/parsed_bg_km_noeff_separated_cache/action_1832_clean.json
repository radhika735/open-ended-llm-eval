  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of irrigating areas planted with peatland plants. The study was in a bog.\nCover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Canada found that irrigation increased the number of Sphagnum moss shoots present 1–2 growing seasons after sowing Sphagnum fragments.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIrrigation systems, such as sprinklers, could be used to maintain a damp peat surface and stop planted vegetation from drying out (Rochefort & Bastien 1998). Water could be recirculated from drainage ditches or ponds on the peatland. Irrigation can be expensive so may be best used as a short-term intervention to kick-start restoration.\nCaution: A suitable water source, with the right level of nutrients and acidity/alkalinity, must be chosen to avoid altering chemical conditions on the peatland (Lamers et al. 2002). For example, bogs should only be irrigated with water stored on the bog, not ground water. Taking water for irrigation might reduce water levels in neighbouring wetlands.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: irrigate peatlands without introducing vegetation.\nLamers L.P., Smolders A.J.P. & Roelofs J.G.M.
