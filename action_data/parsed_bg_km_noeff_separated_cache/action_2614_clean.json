  "action_title": "Use road lighting to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using road lighting to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One of two studies (one controlled and one before-and-after), in the USA, found that road lighting reduced vehicle collisions with moose. The other study found that road lighting did not reduce vehicle collisions with mule deer.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions was found to be six times higher at night and dawn than during the day (Lavsund & Sandegren 1991). Installing lighting along roads may increase visibility of animals to motorists and may, therefore, reduce the number of collisions. However, in areas where species are sensitive to human disturbance, they may avoid areas of roads with artificial lighting and, instead, cross elsewhere.\nLavsund S. & Sandegren F. (1991) Moose-vehicle relations in Sweden: a review. Alces, 27, 118â€“126."
