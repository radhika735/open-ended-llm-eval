  "action_title": "Use low-impact methods to harvest vegetation: freshwater marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using supposedly low-impact methods to harvest vegetation in freshwater marshes.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe impact of harvesting vegetation could be reduced by switching to supposedly lower-impact methods or equipment. For example, vehicles used for harvesting can compress, sink into and create ruts in wet soils. Lower-impact alternatives include: using specialised tracked vehicles or hovercraft which exert less pressure on the ground (Dubowski et al. 2013); ensuring vehicles are not overloaded and heavy (Schröder et al. 2015); and extracting harvested vegetation by hand or helicopter. When logging in swamps, directional felling may reduce the amount of collateral damage when trees fall.\nTo be included as evidence for this action, studies must have compared low- and high-impact harvesting methods, not just reported the effects of methods claimed to be low-impact.\nRelated actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest; Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest; Restrict vehicle use.\nDubowski A.P., Zembrowski K., Rakowicz A., Palowski T., Weymann S. & Wojnilowicz L.
