  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of periodically moving and relocating moorings on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMoorings, permanent or temporary, provide an alternative to anchoring and allow for reduced anchoring in the area. Moorings can be provided for recreational vessels, as well as commercial vessels up to specific sizes. However, moorings also impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through chronic damage and physical disturbance to the seabed (Griffiths et al. 2017; Herbert et al. 2009). Periodically moving and relocating moorings within an area can allow the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to naturally recover over time in the impacted zone (Griffiths et al. 2017; Herbert et al. 2009). Evidence for other interventions related to mooring are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Use moorings which reduce or avoid contact with the seabed (eco-moorings)”, and “Provide additional moorings to reduce anchoring”.\n \nGriffiths C.A., Langmead O.A., Readman J.A.J. & Tillin H.M.
