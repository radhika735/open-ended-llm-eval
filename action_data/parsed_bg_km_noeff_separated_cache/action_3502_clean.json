  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of limiting or excluding off-road vehicle use on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 studies): One replicated, site comparison study found that restricting access of off-road vehicles and sheep had mixed effects on lizard species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one randomized study) in the USA found that areas where off-road vehicles were completely excluded using fencing that also excluded livestock grazing had higher densities of Agassiz’s desert tortoises compared to areas with some restrictions or no restrictions. The other study found that restricting off-road vehicle and sheep access had mixed effects on lizard abundance.\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, site comparison study in the USA found that in areas where off-road vehicles were completely excluded, death rates of Agassiz’s desert tortoises were lower than in areas with some restrictions or no restrictions.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nContinued and uncontrolled use off-road vehicles may damage vegetation and soil characteristics. The impact on wildlife is less studied, although impacts on birds, mammals and reptiles are commonly reported (Vollmer et al. 1977).\nVollmer A.T., Maza B.G., Medica P.A., Turner F.B. & Bamberg S.A.
