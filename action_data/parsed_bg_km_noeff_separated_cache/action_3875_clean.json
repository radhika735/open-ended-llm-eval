  "action_id": "3875",
  "action_title": "Reduce planting density to create warmer woodlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing planting density to create warmer woodlands.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAlthough many species of butterfly and moth are associated with woodland, they often prefer openings within the forest where sunlight penetrates the canopy and creates warmer patches for basking. Replanted woodlands, whether young plantations or native forests, often have trees planted at very high density, which may be unsuitable for warmth-loving butterflies and moths. Reducing the density at which trees are planted may provide habitat for more butterfly and moth species in woodlands."
