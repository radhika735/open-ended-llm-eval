  "action_id": "3696",
  "action_title": "Remove or control non-native reptile competitors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing or controlling non-native reptile competitors on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native species are a threat to native fauna worldwide, and there is growing recognition of the negative impacts that non-native reptiles have on native species and communities (Kraus 2015). Control of non-native species can be expensive and benefits may be difficult to maintain, though actions aimed at reducing their populations may be carried out on an ongoing basis for the benefit of native reptiles.\nKraus F. (2015) Impacts from invasive reptiles and amphibians. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 46, 75–97."
