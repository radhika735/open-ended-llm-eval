  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forest. One study was in each of Côte d’Ivoire, Japan, Ghana and Uganda.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (3 studies): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that rarer species of fruit-feeding butterfly were more frequently caught in a naturally regenerating forest than in a forest still managed by thinning. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that the moth community was different between naturally regenerating forests of different ages. One site comparison study in Ghana found that a naturally regenerating forest had a butterfly community more similar to forest replanted nine years ago than a primary forest or a clear-cut area.\nRichness/diversity (4 studies): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that a naturally regenerating forest had a similar species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies to a forest still managed by thinning. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that naturally regenerating forests had a greater species richness of moths than plantations. One site comparison study in Ghana found that a naturally regenerating forest had lower butterfly species richness than a primary forest, but similar richness to a clear-cut area and a nine-year old replanted forest, and lower community diversity than a primary forest and a clear-cut area. One replicated, site comparison study in Uganda found that naturally regenerating forests had a similar species richness of butterflies to pristine forests, but richness was highest 12–25 years after felling.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (3 studies): One site comparison study in Côte d’Ivoire found that a naturally regenerating forest had a similar abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies to a forest still managed by thinning. One replicated, site comparison study in Japan found that naturally regenerating forests had a greater abundance of moths than plantations. One replicated, site comparison study in Uganda found that naturally regenerating forests had a similar abundance of butterflies to pristine forests, but abundance was highest 12–25 years after felling.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLogging of native forest or plantations causes a dramatic change in the structure of the landscape. Encouraging natural woodland regeneration in logged forest may enable the redevelopment of the forest structure, while encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations may encourage the restoration of native forest in the area. This action includes studies comparing naturally regenerating forest to plantations, continually managed natural forests, or pristine forests (which represent the end goal of regeneration). Note that many species of butterfly and moth do well in early successional woodland after disturbance, but these species may represent a different community to those found in established, pristine forest."
