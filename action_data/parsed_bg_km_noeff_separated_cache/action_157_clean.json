  "action_title": "Distribute poison bait for predator control using dispensers",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA controlled study in New Zealand found that survival of South Island robins Petroica australis australis was higher when brodifacoum was dispensed from bait feeders compared to where bait was scattered.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf bait is easily visible, birds may be more likely to feed on it opportunistically. Therefore providing it in dispensers, which partially hide bait or make it difficult for non-target species to access it, may reduce incidental mortality of non-target species."
