  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of using conditioned taste aversion to prevent non-target species from entering traps. This study was in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USAÂ found that using bait laced with lithium chloride reduced the rate of entry of San Clemente Island foxes into traps set for feral cats.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAnimals may be trapped for a variety of reasons. In cases, such as where trapping is aimed at non-native species, a large number of traps might be set across the landscape. If there is a risk of catching non-target species, these will typically be live traps, from which individuals of non-target species can be released. However, trapping of animals usually entails at least some risk of injury to the animal as well as further risks, such as keeping parents away from their young. Furthermore, a trap holding a non-target animal is generally not then available for capturing the target animal until next visited by an operator. Conditioned taste aversion may be attempted, to try to make non-target mammals that are at risk of capture avoid traps because they associate them with an unpleasant taste or sensation."
