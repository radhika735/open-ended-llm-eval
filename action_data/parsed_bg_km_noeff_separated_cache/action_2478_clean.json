  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of removing burnt trees and branches after wildfire. This study was in Spain.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain found that removing burned trees and branches after wildfire did not increase European wild rabbit numbers compared to removing burned trees but leaving branches in place.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAfter wildfires, a frequent management option is to remove burnt trees but to leave branches on the ground for economic reasons and to prevent soil erosion. However, some mammals are thought to benefit from areas with a low density of woody material at ground level (e.g. Beja et al. 2007) so removing branches might benefit these species.\nBeja P., Pais M. & Palma L.
