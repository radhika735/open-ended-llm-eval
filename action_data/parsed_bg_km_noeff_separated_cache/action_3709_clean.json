  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of planting native species on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOccupancy/range (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that an area reseeded and replanted with native vegetation was colonized and abandoned at different times by two snake and one lizard species, and one other lizard species may have remained, but in low numbers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that grasslands reseeded with both native and non-native grasses were used by Texas horned lizards.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlanting vegetation can help to relatively rapidly re-establish habitats after human disturbance. This may benefit reptile populations.\nStudies that combine native species planting with other restoration activities are discussed under Whole habitat restoration."
