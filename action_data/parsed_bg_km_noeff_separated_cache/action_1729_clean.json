  "action_title": "Implement ‘mosaic management’ of agriculture",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of implementing mosaic management in agricultural systems.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways. For example, patches of agricultural land could be interspersed with natural vegetation that is never harvested. Sphagnum mosses could be farmed in patches on bogs; reeds farmed in patches of fens; trees producing latex, fruit or medicines farmed in patches of tropical peat swamps (e.g. Giesen 2015). There is some evidence that mosaic farmland management may benefit wildlife such as birds (Dicks et al. 2013).\nNote that mosaic management of peatlands is only possible if the farmed areas are kept wet. Draining patches of peatland for agriculture will lower the entire local water table, affecting land beyond the focal agricultural area.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: implement mosaic management when harvesting wild biological resources.\nDicks L.V., Ashpole J.E., Dänhardt J., James K., Jönsson A., Randall N., Showler D.A., Smith R.K., Turpie S., Williams D. & Sutherland W.J.
