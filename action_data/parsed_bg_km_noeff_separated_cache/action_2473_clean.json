  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using artificial insemination. One study was in the USA, one was in Brazil and one was in China.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (3 studies): A study in the USA found that following artificial insemination, fewer than half of female black‐footed ferrets gave birth. A study in Brazil found that following artificial insemination, a captive female Amazonian brown brocket deer gave birth. A replicated study in China found that following artificial insemination, a lower proportion of captive female giant pandas became pregnant than after natural mating.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDuring programmes to rear endangered animals in captivity, in preparation for reintroductions into the wild, artificial insemination may be used to initiate pregnancies. The technique may be used instead of natural mating in situations such as animals being kept at different facilities or where natural mating has failed. It may also be carried out using preserved sperm for purposes of maintaining genetic diversity.\nStudies included here are those identified by our searches of conservation journals. It is likely that other relevant studies exist in biological journals that specialise in reproduction."
