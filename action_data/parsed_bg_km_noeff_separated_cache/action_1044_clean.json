  "action_title": "American bullfrog control: Fencing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the effects of fencing on the control of American bullfrogs.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFencing can be used to reduce population dispersal, thereby reducing the spread of the American bullfrog to neighbouring water bodies.Â  This is particularly useful to contain new populations, and also for use during other control efforts."
