  "action_title": "<i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use dyes to reduce light levels",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, controlled study in the UK found that applying aquatic dye, along with other treatments, did not reduce coverage of Crassula helmsii.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDye treatments work by reducing the amount of light that penetrates through water, and therefore reducing photosynthesis in plants under the water. This could potentially reduce the growth rate of C. helmsii. However, a study in the Netherlands suggested using soluble red and black dyes did not substantially reduce the amount of light penetrating the water. The authors concluded effective control was unlikely given the extreme adaptability of C. helmsii (EPPO 2014).\nFor studies covering the use of lightproof barriers to inhibit growth see ‘Use lightproof barriers’. Increasing turbidity or using shading by vegetation to reduce growth are covered under the intervention ‘Alter environmental conditions to control plants’.\nEPPO (2014) PM 9/19 (1) Invasive alien aquatic plants.
