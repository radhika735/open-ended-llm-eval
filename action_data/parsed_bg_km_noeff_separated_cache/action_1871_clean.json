  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne small study in the USAÂ found that salamanders bred in an aquarium fitted with an artificial aquifer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSome amphibian species appear to breed underground in places where water flows up through rock fragments to form springs (aquifers). In captivity, artificial systems can be designed to replicate these upflows and may improve breeding success for cave-dwelling species."
