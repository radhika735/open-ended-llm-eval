  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour studies examined the effects of creating small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. Two studies were in marinas in France and Morocco, while one was in each of a lagoon in Mayotte and a port in France.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nFish community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in France found that creating small swimthrough habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on the juvenile fish community composition on and around structure surfaces, depending on the site and survey month. Swimthrough habitats supported six species that were absent from structure surfaces without swimthroughs.\nFish richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in France found that creating small swimthrough habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on juvenile fish species richness on and around structure surfaces, depending on the site.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nFish abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, paired sites, controlled studies in France found that creating small swimthrough habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on juvenile fish abundances on and around structure surfaces, depending on the species, site, survey month and/or juvenile development stage.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)\n\nUse (3 studies): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in France found that creating small swimthrough habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on juvenile seabream habitat use on and around structure surfaces, depending on the species and juvenile development stage. Two studies (including one replicated study) in Mayotte and Morocco reported that small swimthrough habitats, along with large swimthroughs and environmentally-sensitive material in one, were used by juvenile spiny lobsters, sea firs, adult fish and/or juvenile fish.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats’ are adjoining internal cavities sheltered from, but with access to/from, outside the structure. Dimensions can vary but are ≤100 mm in any direction.\nSmall adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats are not well-studied in subtidal rocky habitats. They may form through weathering of softer rocks, amongst loosely-consolidated cobbles/boulders, or within three-dimensional structures created by living organisms. They likely provide organisms refuge from predation, in the same way crevice and hole habitats do (Mercader et al. 2019; Nelson & Vance 1979). They could also serve as corridors, connecting adjacent refuge habitats. The size and density of cavities or swimthroughs is likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them. Small habitats can provide refuge for small-bodied organisms but may exclude larger organisms, limit their growth and get rapidly filled-up (Firth et al. 2020). Large habitats can be used by larger-bodied organisms but may not provide sufficient refuge from predators for smaller organisms. By default, cavities and swimthroughs contain shaded surfaces, which can be associated with the presence of non-native species (Dafforn 2017).\nCavities/swimthroughs are sometimes present on marine artificial structures made of consolidated boulders or blocks (Sherrard et al. 2016) or gabion baskets (Firth et al. 2014), but are absent from many other structures. Small adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding or removing material, either during construction or retrospectively.\nThere is a body of literature investigating the effects of creating swimthrough habitats on artificial reefs (e.g. Brotto et al. 2006; Hylkema et al. 2020; Noordin Raja Omar et al. 1994). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on in situ conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.\nSee also: Create hole habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create crevice habitats (&gt;50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Create large adjoining cavities or ‘swimthrough’ habitats (&gt;100 mm) on subtidal artificial structures.\nBrotto D.S., Krohling W., Brum S. & Zalmon I.R.
