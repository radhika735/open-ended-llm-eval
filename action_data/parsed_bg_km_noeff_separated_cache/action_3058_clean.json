  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using herbicide to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study aiming to restore freshwater marshes in the USA found that applying herbicide to trees (along with other interventions) significantly affected the overall plant community composition over the following five years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nCharacteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study aiming to restore freshwater marshes in the USA reported that of the 26 plant taxa that became more frequent after applying herbicide to trees (along with other interventions), 16 were obligate wetland taxa.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDisturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Applying herbicide might be one way to do this.\nBear in mind that the effects of herbicide might be highly dependent on the chemical used, how it is applied and local site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Tobias et al. 2016).\nCaution: In many herbicides, the active chemicals are not specific to the problematic species so can cause collateral damage to desirable species. Relying on herbicides as the only tool to manage problematic plants can lead to the development of herbicide resistance in future generations (Powles et al. 1997). Herbicides can have severe negative side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use – particularly in or near wetlands or water bodies – is limited in many countries.\nRelated actions: Use herbicide to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime.\nHall S.J., Lindig-Cisneros R. & Zedler J.B.
