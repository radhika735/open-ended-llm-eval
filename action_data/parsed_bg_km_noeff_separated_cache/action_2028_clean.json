  "action_title": "Retain buffer zones around core habitat",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining buffer zones around core habitat on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRetaining areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation around core habitat can help to protect the habitat and wildlife that it supports from the detrimental effects of habitat loss or disturbance. Core bat habitats include foraging, drinking and swarming sites, as well as roosts and hibernacula. Buffers may also be retained along important bat commuting routes.\nTo be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared core bat habitats where a buffer has been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where buffers have not been kept. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the buffer and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.\nFor interventions relating to retaining buffers around bat habitats in logged forests, see ‘Retain buffers around roost trees in logged areas’ and ‘Retain riparian buffers in logged areas’. For planting of buffer zones to reduce pollution see ‘Plant riparian buffer strips’."
