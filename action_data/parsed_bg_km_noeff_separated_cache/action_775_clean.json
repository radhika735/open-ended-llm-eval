  "action_title": "Use mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nParasitism: One randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site when mass-emergence devices were used in urban areas. Pest damage: The same study found no effect on pest damage to horse chestnut trees",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMass-emergence devices are containers giving natural enemies a sheltered environment and a food or prey source (such as pollen or pests on infested foliage), enabling enemy numbers to establish before emerging from the device and dispersing into the crop. Designs may include size-selective exits, preventing pests but allowing natural enemies (such as parasitoid wasps) to leave and disperse. Conventional practices of removing and destroying pest-infested crop foliage can reduce natural enemy numbers, but using the foliage in mass-emergence devices instead may relocate natural enemies back into the crop.\nWe found no studies testing this action in a farmed environment, but one study of urban trees is presented here as preliminary evidence."
