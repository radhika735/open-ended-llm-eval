  "action_title": "Replace nesting substrate following severe weather",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nTwo before-and-after studies from Canada found that common tern Sterna hirundo populations increased at one colony where nesting substrates were replaced, but decreased at a second. Several other interventions were used at both sites, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of substrate replacement.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany birds require specific substrates to nest on, and if flooding or heavy rains remove these then they may not nest. Replacing the substrate following removal may therefore help a colony to survive. Most studies describing the reconstruction of nesting habitats or the protection of nests from flooding are described in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’."
