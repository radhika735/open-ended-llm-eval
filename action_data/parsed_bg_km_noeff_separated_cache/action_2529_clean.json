  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing or controlling non-native invasive plants. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated study in the USA found that control of introduced saltcedar did not change small mammal species richness.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nAbundance (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that partial removal of velvet mesquite did not increase abundances of six mammal species.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInvasive plants can out compete established plant species and alter habitat structure. This may alter resource availability for mammals. Some mammal species may benefit but, for others, invasive plants may reduce available food or shelter or change the nature of the environment such that they are at increased risk of predation. Removal or control of non-native invasive plants may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these effects."
