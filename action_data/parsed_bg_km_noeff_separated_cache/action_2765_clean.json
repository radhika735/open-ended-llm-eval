  "action_title": "Introduce regulations for flying aircraft over marine and freshwater mammals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing regulations for flying aircraft over marine and freshwater mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine and freshwater mammals may be disturbed by aircraft flying overhead, such as helicopters and small airplanes (Richardson et al. 1997, Patenaude et al. 2006). Underwater noise pollution from commercial passenger airplanes is also likely to be audible to marine mammals and may be of conservation concern for species inhabiting coastal waters close to airports (Erbe et al. 2018). This intervention involves introducing regulations for flying aircraft over marine and freshwater mammals to reduce disturbance. This may include setting limits on minimum altitude and the duration or number of flights over individual mammal groups.\nFor an intervention that relates to flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals, see Introduce regulations for flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals.\nErbe C., Williams R., Parsons M., Parsons S.K., Hendrawan I.G. & Dewantama I.M.I.
