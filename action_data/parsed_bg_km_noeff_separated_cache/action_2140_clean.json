  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies examined the effects of reducing the number or modifying the arrangement of tickler chains/chain mats on subtidal benthic invertebrates. All studies were in the North Sea (Germany and Netherlands).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the North Sea found that using a beam trawl with a chain mat caused lower mortality of benthic invertebrates in the trawl tracks compared to using a beam trawl with tickler chains.\nUnwanted catch abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea found that all three modified parallel tickler chain arrangements reduced the combined amount of non-commercial unwanted invertebrate and fish catch compared to unmodified trawl nets, but the other found that none of three modified parabolic tickler chain arrangements reduced it.\n\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nCommercial catch abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired, controlled studies in the North Sea found that three modified parabolic tickler chain arrangements caught similar amounts of commercial species to unmodified nets, but the other found that three modified parallel tickler chain arrangements caught lower amounts.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Beam trawls are rigged with either tickler chains stretching from one side of the trawl mouth to the other, or a stone mat. Tickler chains are metal chains which drag along the seabed in front of the net with the aim of disturbing fish in the path of the trawl, causing them to enter the net. A chain mat is a network of chains over the trawl’s mouth designed to prevent large stones from entering the gear while also disturbing fish that are then caught in the net. Chain and mats can therefore disturb the seabed as well as increase unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrates. To potentially reduce these unwanted effects, fewer tickler chains can be used, or the arrangement of chains and mats can be modified (Van Marlen et al. 2005), for example by attaching only one end of the chain to the beam, or reducing the size of the chain links (Bergman & Van Santbrink 2000; Broadhurst et al. 2015).\nEvidence for other interventions related to fishing gear modifications is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use”.\n \nBergman M.J.N. & Van Santbrink J.W.
