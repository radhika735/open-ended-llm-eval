  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\n\nTwo before-and-after studies in the USA and Ireland found that the addition of browse to food in boxes, baskets or tubes increased activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves using boxes or bags to hide daily meals given to primates.
