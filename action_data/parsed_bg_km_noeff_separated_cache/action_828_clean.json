  "action_title": "Remove or control fish using rotenone",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies (including one replicated study) in Sweden, the UK and USA found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance and recruitment or newt populations.\nOne review in Australia, the UK and USA found that fish control, which included using rotenone, increased breeding success for four amphibian species.\nTwo replicated studies in Pakistan and the UK found when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRotenone is used as a broad-spectrum pesticide to control fish and insects. It is derived from the roots of plants in the bean family and is rapidly broken down in soil and water.\nThere is a large amount of literature that is not included here examining the success of controlling fish using rotenone, which may be undertaken specifically for the conservation of amphibian species (e.g. Willis & Ling 2000; Piec 2006).\nPiec D. (2006) Rotenone as a conservation tool in amphibian conservation. A case study of fish control operation undertaken at Orton Pit SSSI, Peterborough, UK. Froglife report.\nWillis K. & Ling N. (2000) Sensitivities of mosquitofish and black mudfish to a piscicide: could rotenone be used to control mosquitofish in New   Zealand wetlands? New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 27, 85â€“91."
