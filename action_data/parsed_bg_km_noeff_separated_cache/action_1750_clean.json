  "action_title": "Physically exclude vehicles from peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of physically excluding vehicles from peatlands. The study was in a fen.\nVegetation structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, site comparison study in a floating fen in the USA reported that fencing off airboat trails allowed total and non-woody vegetation biomass to increase, recovering to levels recorded in undisturbed fen. Woody plant biomass did not recover.\nOverall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that fencing off airboat trails allowed overall plant diversity to increase, recovering to levels recorded in undisturbed fen.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVehicles (e.g. cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats) can directly damage peatland vegetation. They can also compress and rut soft, wet peat, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects peatland vegetation. Vehicles could be physically excluded from pristine peatlands to prevent damage, or from damaged peatlands to let them recover. Physical barriers could be fences, fallen trees or areas of water/wet ground.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: restrict vehicle use on peatlands, using non-physical means such as signs or voluntary codes."
