  "action_id": "2802",
  "action_title": "Use a smaller mesh size for fishing nets",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using a smaller mesh size for fishing nets on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nUsing a smaller mesh size for fishing nets may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled (Northridge et al. 2017). However, the feasibility of this intervention will depend on the size of the target catch species. There may also be issues with implementation where minimum mesh size regulations are in place to reduce unwanted catch of juvenile animals and/or smaller species.\nNorthridge S., Coram A., Kingston A. & Crawford R. (2017) Disentangling the causes of protected-species bycatch in gillnet fisheries. Conservation Biology, 31, 686–695."
