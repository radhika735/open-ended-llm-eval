  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using fencing to protect water sources for use by wild mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWater, from natural or artificial sources, can be an important resource, shaping the distribution of wild mammals in arid areas. Fencing may be installed to protect these water sources from domestic or wild animals whilst still permitting entry of smaller mammals (e.g. Gaudioso Lacasa et al. 2010).\nGaudioso Lacasa V., Sánchez García-Abad C., Prieto Martín R., Bartolomé Rodríguez D.J., Pérez Garrido J.A. & Alonso de La Varga M.E. (2010) Small game water troughs in a Spanish agrarian pseudo steppe: visits and water site choice by wild fauna. European Journal of Wildlife Research, 56, 591–599."
