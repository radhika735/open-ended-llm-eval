  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects of diverting bats using an artificial hedgerow on bat populations. The study was in Switzerland.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)      \n\nUse (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in Switzerland found that up to one fifth of lesser horseshoe bats within a colony flew along an artificial hedgerow to commute.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLinear features such as hedgerows and treelines provide important commuting routes for bats (e.g. Limpens & Kapteyn 1991, Verboom & Huitema 1997, Downs & Racey 2006). Roads or railways can fragment these commuting routes cutting off important habitat. Attempts may be made to divert bats from their original commuting routes to crossing structures or safe crossing places along roads/railways, by planting tree lines or hedgerows, or installing fences. Berthinussen & Altringham (2012) found that although diverted bats were not recorded directly, very few bats used two underpasses below roads where attempts had been made to divert bats to them with plantings. Conversely, high numbers of bats were found using an underpass constructed on an original flight path.\nFor general interventions that involve creating or retaining bat commuting routes, see ‘Create new unlit bat commuting routes using planting’ and ‘Retain existing bat commuting routes’.\nBerthinussen A. & Altringham J.
