  "action_title": "Control traffic and traffic timing",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One randomized, replicated study from Poland found higher numbers and bacterial activity under controlled traffic. One replicated site comparison study from Denmark found higher microbial biomass when farm traffic was not controlled\nErosion: Five trials from Europe and Australia (including three replicated trials, one controlled before-and after-trial, and one review) found a higher number of pores in the soil, less compaction, reduced runoff and increased water filtration into the soil under controlled traffic. One controlled, replicated trial from India found increased soil crack width when traffic was not controlled.\nYield: Two replicated trials from Australia and the USA found increased yield under controlled traffic.\n \nSOIL TYPES COVERED: clay, loamy-sand, loamy-silt, sandy loam, silty, silty-clay, silt loam.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. A higher number of soil pores (or soil porosity) is an indicator of good soil structure."
