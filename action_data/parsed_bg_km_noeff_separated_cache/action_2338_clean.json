  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated study from the USA found higher bird species richnesses, including insectivorous species, on sites with grazers excluded while a further study from the USA found no difference.\nOne before and after study from riparian corridors the USA found that abundances of some insectivorous birds increased after grazers were excluded, or the abundances of some species were higher in sites with grazers excluded; seven studies from the USA and Argentina found that overall abundance or the abundances of some species were lower on sites without grazers, or did not differ between treatments.\nThree studies from the USA investigated productivity and found it higher in sites with grazers excluded. In one study this difference was only found on improved, not unimproved pastures.",
