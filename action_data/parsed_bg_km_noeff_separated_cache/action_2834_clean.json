  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing fishing gear exchange programmes to encourage fishers to use gear that reduces unwanted catch of mammals on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIntroducing fishing gear exchange programmes may encourage fishers to use gear types that reduce the unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. Fishers may be provided with alternative gear types that are less harmful to mammals after surrendering their existing gear. Training on the use of new fishing gear may also be required.\nSee also Finance low interest loans to convert to fishing gear that reduces unwanted catch of mammals and Involve fishers in designing and trialling new fishing gear types to encourage uptake of gear that reduces unwanted catch of mammals."
