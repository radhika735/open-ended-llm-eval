  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated field study in Spain found that Aranzadi turtle traps were effective in trapping red-eared terrapins from a river but did not eradicate the population.\nA study in the British Virgin Islands found that using sein nets to trap adults and juveniles was not successful in eradicating the population.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDirect removal of adults by trapping, netting, shooting, or hand capture, may offer a tool for localised eradication, particularly in England, UK where there are no known instances of successful reproduction in the wild.\nA variety of traps are referenced in the literature.  For example, a fact sheet on the red-eared terrapin Trachemys scripta references successful use of floating boards with baited cages on top by terrapins as basking sites.  Trap preference is sometimes determined by the level of visibility to the public in addition to efficacy (Bringsøe 2006).   An information bulletin references that in Australia, funnelled ‘Cathedral traps’ are used in preference to ‘basking traps’ which are difficult to transport and unsuitable for use in public or high visibility locations (O’Keefe 2009).  Some studies have researched the impact of bait location on trap success. For example, a replicated field study in the USA researched bait location and found no significant difference in trapping rate between traps with bait suspended near the funnel entrance, and traps with bait filled containers (Nall & Thomas 2009).\nNo studies have been found that reference successful local eradication using trapping or netting techniques.\nBringsøe H.
