  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study examined the effects of fitting a funnel, sievenet, or other escape devices on trawl nets on marine subtidal invertebrate. The study was in the North Sea (UK).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nUnwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the North Sea found that trawl nets fitted with a sievenet appeared to catch fewer unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates compared to unmodified nets.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTrawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The net is wide at the opening and narrows to a bag or ‘codend’, tied at the end with a drawstring, where organisms are trapped. Trawl nets can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. To reduce the amount of unwanted organisms, a net can be modified by inserting a funnel-like device (such as a sievenet) before the codend (Santos et al. 2018). This device is designed to direct unwanted catch to an escape hole in the body of the trawl. The idea is that the target species go over the hole in the net, while non-target species can escape through the release hole. These funnel-like devices are usually not made of rigid material and therefore can be more acceptable to fishers than a rigid sorting grid (evidence summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames to trawl nets”).\n \nSantos J., Herrmann B., Mieske B., Krag L.
