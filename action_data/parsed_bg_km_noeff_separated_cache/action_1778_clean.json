  "action_title": "Clean waste water before it enters the environment",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effect, on peatland vegetation, of cleaning waste water before it enters the environment. The study was in a fen.\nCharacteristic plants (1 study): One study in a floating fen in the Netherlands found that after input water began to be cleaned (along with other interventions to reduce pollution), cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels increased.\nVegetation structure (1 study): The same study found that after input water began to be cleaned (along with other interventions to reduce pollution), vascular plant biomass decreased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWaste water could be cleaned before it is released into peatlands or before it enters the environment in general (ultimately reaching peatlands). Excess nutrients, salts, heavy metals, radioactive materials and organic compounds should be removed. Acidity (pH) should be adjusted. Hot water should be cooled. Waste water could be treated using traditional industrial methods, or in ‘constructed wetlands’ that contain plants and microorganisms to absorb or break down pollutants (Kadlec et al. 2000).\nCaution: Peatland vegetation is very sensitive to water chemistry (Rydin & Jeglum 2013). If cleaned waste water is being discharged directly into a peatland, its chemistry should be carefully controlled to match natural input water. Note that bogs receive their water only as rain, so are likely to be harmed by any other water inputs.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: remove atmospheric pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment.\nKadlec R.H., Knight R.L., Vymazal J., Brix H., Cooper P. & Haberl R.
