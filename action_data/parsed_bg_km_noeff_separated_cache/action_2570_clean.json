  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating forest. Two studies were in the USA and one each were in Colombia, Italy and Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nRichness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the USA and Colombia found that mammal species richness in restored forest was similar to that in established forest.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (one a site comparison) in Australia and Italy found that replanted or regrowing forest supported a higher abundance of hazel dormice than did coppiced forest. The other study found only low numbers of common brushtail possums or common ringtail possums by 7–30 years after planting.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUsage (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that restored riparian forest areas were visited more by carnivores than were remnant forests when restored areas were newly established, but not subsequently, whilst restored areas were not visited more frequently by black-tailed deer.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nRestoring or creating forest and woodland may provide important habitat for forest-dependant mammal species, particularly in disturbed or fragmented landscapes. Trees grow slowly and therefore the effects of forest restoration may not be evident for decades or even longer after restoration begins. Care must therefore be taken when interpreting the results of these studies."
