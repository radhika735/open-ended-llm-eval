  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years, despite being rehabilitated, alongside other interventions. Two before-and-after studies in South Africa found that most reintroduced vervet monkeys survived over six months after being rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions.\nTwo before-and-after studies in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over 3.5–5 years after undergoing pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions. One study in The Gambia found that numbers of reintroduced chimpanzees that underwent pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions, increased by 38% over 25 years.\nOne review on bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas in 13 African countries found that rehabilitated bonobos living in sanctuaries did not reproduce but the reproductive rate of chimpanzees was 14% and of gorillas was 2%.\nOne controlled study in Indonesia found that Bornean agile gibbons that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, behaved similarly to wild gibbons.\nOne controlled study in Malaysia found that numbers of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years, despite orangutans being rehabilitated before release. One controlled study in Indonesia found that most translocated orangutans that were rehabilitated before release, along with other interventions, survived over three months.\nOne before-and-after, site comparison study in the Congo and Gabon found that most western lowland gorillas that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, survived over four years. One before-and-after study in Gabon found that one out of two western lowland gorillas that were reintroduced died despite being rehabilitated, alongside other interventions.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWhen primates are injured or orphaned, rehabilitating them (e.g. at a sanctuary or other facility) may increase their chance of survival. For example, primate infants are frequently captured to be sold via the illegal pet trade and many such primates underwent severe physiological and psychological stressors and thus need intensive care after being confiscated. Rehabilitation can include all activities from rescuing injured/orphaned primates, providing medical/psychological care, raising orphans, to fostering behaviour and reintroducing them back into the wild.\n            The fostering of certain behaviours to facilitate the species’ survival in the wild (e.g. foraging, hunting, nest building, climbing) is discussed separately under ‘Fostering appropriate behaviour to facilitate rehabilitation’ and the reintroduction of primates back into the wild, using slightly different methodologies, is discussed under ‘Reintroduce primates in groups’, ‘Reintroduce primates as single/multiple individuals’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is absent’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is present’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat without predators’ and ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat with predators’."
