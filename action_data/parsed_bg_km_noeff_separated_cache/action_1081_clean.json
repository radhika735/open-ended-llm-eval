  "action_title": "Brown and black bullheads: Trapping using sound or pheromonal lures",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence has been found for the effectiveness of trapping bullheads using sound or pheromonal lures.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nBrown bullheads are notable for their sound production.  In the lab, they produce sound during aggressive, conspecific encounters (Anderson et al. 2008).  Certain fish species, such as the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, are also attracted to pheromones from the same species (Gammon et al. 2005).  It is possible that there is potential for trapping bullhead fish using sound or pheromonal lures provided that possible influences on non-target species are addressed.\nAnderson, K., Rountree, R. & Juanes, F. (2008) Soniferous fishes in the Hudson River. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 137, 616-626.\nGammon D.B., Li W., Scott A.P., Zielinski B.S. & Corkum L.D.
