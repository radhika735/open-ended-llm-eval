  "action_title": "Set regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 to 1993, until it was banned in 1993 following international treaties. However, enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Disposal within the sediment (sub-sea burial) was never implemented and such process currently falls under the ban of nuclear waste disposal at sea. However, it is being proposed by various countries and may be an option in the future (Hollister & Nadis 1998). Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of nuclear waste can help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates.\n \nHollister C.D. & Nadis S. (1998) Burial of radioactive waste under the seabed. Scientific American, 278, 60–65."
