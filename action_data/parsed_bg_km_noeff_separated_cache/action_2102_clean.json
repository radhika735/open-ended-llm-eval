  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nEight studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all towed fishing gear on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. One study was in the Limfjord (Denmark), two in the English Channel (UK), three in Georges Bank in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA and Canada), one in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal), and one in the Irish Sea (Isle of Man).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (3 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies in the Limfjord and the English Channel, found that areas excluding towed fishing gear for either an unspecified amount of time or two to 23 years had different overall invertebrate community composition compared to areas where towed-fishing occurred and one found that ceasing towed-gear fishing for nine years had mixed effects.\nOverall species richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the English Channel reported that areas excluding towed fishing gear for either an unspecified amount of time or two to 23 years had different or greater invertebrate species richness and diversity to areas where towed-fishing occurred. One site comparison study in Georges Bank found no difference in invertebrate species richness between an area closed to mobile fishing gear for 10 to 14 years and a fished area.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the English Channel and Georges Bank found that sites excluding towed gear for either two to 23 years or 10 to 14 years had greater overall invertebrate biomass compared to sites where towed-gear fishing occurred, but one also found that abundance was similar in both areas. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Ria Formosa lagoon found that ceasing towed gear for 10 months led to increases in the cover of mobile but not sessile\nMollusc abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Irish Sea and the English Channel found that areas closed to towed fishing gear for either two to 23 years or 14 years had more scallops compared to adjacent fished areas.\nMollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study the Irish Sea found that an area closed to towed fishing gear for 14 years had higher proportions of older and larger scallops compared to an adjacent fished area.\nStarfish abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Georges Bank found more starfish in areas closed to towed fishing gear for five to nine years compared to adjacent fished areas.\nStarfish condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Georges Bank found that starfish arm length was similar in areas closed to towed fishing gear for five to nine years and adjacent fished areas.\n\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall community biological production (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Georges Bank found an increase in the biological production from invertebrate in sites closed to towed fishing gear for approximately five years compared to adjacent fished sites.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Bottom trawls and dredges are mobile fishing gears towed behind a vessel and are known to be particularly damaging as they are dragged onto the seabed (mid-water trawls can also sometimes accidentally come into contact with the seabed). Ceasing or prohibiting all towed gears in an area, for instance through bylaws or voluntary agreements (Blyth et al. 2002), can remove their direct pressure on subtidal benthic invertebrates and potentially allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Blyth et al. 2004). Evidence related to ceasing only trawls or only dredges are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit bottom trawling” and “Cease or prohibit dredging”, respectively. When the cessation of towed fishing gear occurs in the context of a marine protected area, the evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”.\n \nBlyth R.E., Kaiser M.J., Edwards-Jones G. & Hart P.J.B.
