  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects of hand-rearing orphaned mammals. Two were in the USA, one each was in Australia, South Africa and India and one was in six countries across North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (1 study): One study in India found that three hand-reared orphaned or abandoned greater one-horned rhinoceroses gave birth in the wild.\nSurvival (5 studies): Five studies (including one controlled and one replicated) in Australia, the USA, India and in six countries across North America, Europe and Asia, found that some hand-reared orphaned or abandoned ringtail possums, white-tailed deer, sea otters, bears and greater one-horned rhinoceroses survived for periods of time after release.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): A study in South Africa found that a hand-reared, orphaned serval established a home range upon release.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nYoung mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. Success of such programmes can be difficult to judge, without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.\nThis intervention includes studies where mammals are hand-reared.
