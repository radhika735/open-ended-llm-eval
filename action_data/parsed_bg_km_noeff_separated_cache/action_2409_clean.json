  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on target mammals of using livestock fences that are permeable to wildlife. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): A study in the USA found that wild ungulates crossed a triangular cross-section fence with varying success rates. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that fences with a lowered top wire were crossed more by elk than were conventional fences.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFences erected to retain domestic livestock or, in some cases, exclude wild herbivores or carnivores may also act as barriers to non-target species. Fence designs may be adapted to permit crossings and, thus, retain habitat connectivity for specific species. Fence designs are likely to vary between different situations, depending on the nature of the original fence and the species being targeted for continued access.
