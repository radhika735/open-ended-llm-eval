  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies examined the effects of establishing temporary fisheries closures on subtidal benthic invertebrates. One study was in the English Channel (UK), one in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel (Australia), one in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), two in the Mozambique Channel (Madagascar), and one in the North Sea (UK).\n\n \nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nOverall species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed-gear fishing did not have greater invertebrate species richness than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round.\nMollusc community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and after study in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to all fishing for 12 years only to recreational fishing led to changes in scallop species community composition over four fishing seasons.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed-gear fishing did not have a greater invertebrate biomass than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round.\nCrustacean abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that reopening a site to fishing following a temporary 20-month closure led to lower total abundance but similar marketable abundance of European lobsters compared to a continuously-fished site after a month.\nMollusc abundance (5 studies): One replicated, site comparison study English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed gear did not have higher abundance of great scallops than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round. Two before-and after, site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mozambique Channel found that temporarily closing an area to reef octopus fishing did not increase octopus abundance/biomass compared to before closure and to continuously fished areas. Two replicated, before-and after studies in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel and the North Pacific Ocean found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to all fishing to recreational fishing only led to a decline in scallop abundance after four fishing seasons and in red abalone after three years.\nMollusc condition (3 studies): One replicated, before-and after study in the North Pacific Ocean found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to fishing led to a decline in the size of red abalone after three years. Two before-and after, site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mozambique Channel found that temporarily closing an area to reef octopus fishing increased the weight of octopus compared to before closure and to continuously fished areas, but one also found that this effect did not last once fishing resumed.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nEstablishing temporary fishery closures in an area can temporarily remove the most direct pressure from fishing to subtidal benthic invertebrates, and provide relief to impacted populations, which are, in theory, able to recover over time during the temporary closure (rotation) (Blyth et al. 2004; Hiddink et al. 2006; Rogers-Bennett et al. 2013). Temporary closures can include for instance: 1) seasonal closures, often done with the aim of protecting adults during the spawning season or to protect juveniles during times of recruitment or settlement, 2) rotational closures during which areas are alternately closed and opened to fishing following a specific timing, or 3) move-on rules whereby temporary closure of a fished area occurs when a catch or by-catch threshold is reached (Dunn et al. 2014). It is important to know how populations change once fisheries resume inside temporary closures, in order to understand whether the closures were effective, if the effects last, and if further measures and/or closures need to be implemented. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use - Cease or prohibit all types of fishing” and “Cease or prohibit commercial fishing”, and in “Habitat protection - Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all types of fishing” and “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit commercial fishing”.\n \nBlyth R.E., Kaiser M.J., Edwards-Jones G. & Hart P.J.B.
