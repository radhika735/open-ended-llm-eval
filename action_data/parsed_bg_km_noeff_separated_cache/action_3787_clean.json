  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on tortoise, terrapin, side-necked and softshell turtle populations of relocating nests/eggs to a hatchery. One study was in Costa Rica and Venezuela.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nReproductive success (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Venezuela found that yellow-headed sideneck turtle eggs relocated to a hatchery had higher hatching success than both natural nests and artificially incubated eggs. One study in Costa Rica reported that 80% of Nicaraguan slider eggs in a hatchery hatched successfully.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nReptile nests may be relocated away from specific threats (e.g. egg collecting, flooding, erosion, predation, or being crushed on roads) and reburied in an organised ‘hatchery’. Hatcheries consist of a defined location on or near the nesting beach, well above the high tide line, that is often fenced and patrolled. Nests/eggs collected from the beach are then reburied within the hatchery, where they can be closely monitored.\nBurying a potentially large number of nests/eggs within a relatively small area may present a number of risks, and the consequences of disturbances such as flooding or poaching could be particularly severe. Other environmental variables at the hatchery location (e.g. temperature and humidity) may also impact on the sex, size, shape, colour, behaviour, movement ability and post-hatching growth of the hatchlings (Warner & Andrews 2002, Booth et al. 2006), and should be carefully considered when selecting the location.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See her for: Sea turtles; Snakes & lizards; Crocodilians; Tuatara.\nFor studies that discuss moving nests/eggs to other locations on the beach, but not to a hatchery, see Relocate nests/eggs to a nearby natural setting (not including hatcheries), and for those that discuss the effects of relocating eggs into artificial settings, including into polystyrene boxes and other containers, see Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation.\nSee also: Alter incubation temperatures to achieve optimal/desired sex ratio.\nBooth D.T.
