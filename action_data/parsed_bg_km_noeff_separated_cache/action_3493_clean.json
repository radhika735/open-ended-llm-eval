  "action_id": "3493",
  "action_title": "Limit heavy vehicle use",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting heavy vehicle use on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHeavy vehicle traffic associated with mining is known to have direct impacts on wildlife, particularly through roadkill and the destruction (crushing or collapse) of burrows (Lovich & Ennen 2011). Indirect effects include soil compaction, which may limit the ability of reptiles to burrow. For studies on the effectiveness of actions that address the impact of road vehicles, see Threat: Transportation service corridors.\nLovich J.E. & Ennen J.R. (2011) Wildlife conservation and solar energy development in the desert southwest, United States. BioScience, 61, 982–992."
