  "action_title": "Maintain/restore water flow across service corridors",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of restoring water flow across service corridors. The study was in a fen.\nCharacteristic plants (1 study): One before-and-after study in a fen in the USA found that following restoration of water inflow across a road (along with general rewetting), cover of wet peatland sedges increased whilst cover of grasses preferring drier conditions decreased.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeatlands may depend upon natural inflows or outflows of water, both above and below the surface, to maintain appropriate moisture and chemical conditions. Transportation or service corridors can block these water flows. This impact can be avoided by careful design e.g. building using permeable materials, or building raised service corridors (but note that floating roads built without digging into peat still block surface flow, and often sink over time so will block subsurface flow). Alternatively, water flows can be restored by building culverts, pipes or water diversions.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: rewetting more generally; restoring water level fluctuations."
