  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study in the USAÂ found that adding carotenoids to fruit flies fed to frogs reduced the number of clutches, but increased the number of tadpoles and successful metamorphs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIn captivity, amphibian diets are often dramatically simplified, and prey species are often those that can be bred cheaply and efficiently in captivity. By providing amphibians with prey that have been in reared on a substrate dusted with carotenoids, which may not naturally be present in the prey, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided. Carotenoids are found in the yolk of eggs and are thought to provide a range of benefits, including improving neonate health."
