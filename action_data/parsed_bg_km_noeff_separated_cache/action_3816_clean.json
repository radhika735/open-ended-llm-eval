  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing fishing permit/licence or charter schemes on marine fish populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommercial fishing can lead to unsustainable depletion of fish populations through removal of fish and mortality of discards. To attempt to regulate fishing activity in an area, permits/licences or charters may be implemented that represent an agreement between the fishers and fisheries managers. To be authorized to fish, each fisher must abide by the rules stipulated by the permit or charter. This may include measures such as communicating details of their catches and setting limits on fishing periods and/or how much gear can be fished. Fishing effort may be able to be controlled so that the effects of over-fishing are avoided (Cadiou et al. 2009). Compliance and enforcement of illegal activity may also be improved.\nCadiou G., Boudouresque C.F., Bonhomme P. & Direach L.L. (2009) The management of artisanal fishing within the Marine Protected Area of the Port-Cros National Park (northwest Mediterranean Sea): a success story? ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66, 41–49."
