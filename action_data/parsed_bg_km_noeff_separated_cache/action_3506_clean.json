  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting road construction in important habitats on reptile populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLimiting road construction is a legislative intervention requiring that impacted species or habitats be considered at the planning stages of road or service corridors. It may include preventing road construction altogether, or changing the road design to avoid key habitats. For example, a case study in North Carolina, USA suggested that a road was moved 100 m to avoid a timber rattlesnake Crotalus horridus rookery and a high density of eastern box turtles Terrapene carolina (Andrews et al. 2006).\nAndrews K.M., Gibbons J.W. & Jochimsen D.M.
