  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSeven studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways. All seven studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\n\nSurvival (5 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one replicated), in the USA, found that barrier fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. One of two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated, controlled), in the USA, found that barrier fencing with escape gates along roads with one or more underpasses reduced moose-vehicle collisions, whilst the other found no reduction in total mammal road casualty rates. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in USA found that earth escape ramps reduced mammal road mortalities.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)\n\nUse (4 studies): One of two studies (one replicated) in the USA, found that one-way gates allowed mule deer to escape when trapped along highways with barrier fencing, whilst the other found that a small proportion used one-way gates. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that earth escape ramps were used more often than were one-way escape gates to enable deer to escape highways with barrier fencing. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that barrier fencing with escape gates and underpasses facilitated road crossings by a range of mammals.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFencing alongside roads can prevent or reduce mammal access to roads and, thus, reduce vehicle collisions with mammals. However, mammals that do manage to access roads, either around fence ends or through defective sections of fence, can then become trapped on the road. One-way gates are intended to allow escape of such mammals from the road whilst not enabling additional animals to access the road. Other structures can serve a similar purpose, such as ramps up to fence-top height at one side.\nSee also: Install barrier fencing along roads."
