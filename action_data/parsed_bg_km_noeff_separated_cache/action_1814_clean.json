  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of covering a peatland with something other than mulch (without planting). Both studies were in bogs.\nVegetation cover (2 studies): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in Germany reported that covering bare peat with fleece or fibre mats did not affect the number of seedlings of five herb/shrub species. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in bogs in Australia reported that recently-burned plots shaded with plastic mesh developed greater cover of native plants, forbs and Sphagnum moss than unshaded plots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPeatland vegetation may be killed by hot, dry and bright conditions on bare peat surfaces (e.g. Harley et al. 1989; Sagot & Rochefort 1996). Covers (e.g. plastic sheets, fleece or fibre mats) can maintain more stable temperatures and humidity, and offer some shading. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of peatland vegetation (Good et al. 2009). The precise effect (mainly affecting light and/or moisture) depends on the material and its height above the peatland.\nThis section considers the effect of adding covers without adding vegetation. The cover is intended to help existing vegetation e.g. remnant moss patches, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already in the peat. We use the term mesh to describe covers such as shade cloths, gauze and netting that are used to shade a peatland.\nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: cover peat with organic mulch; add cover other than mulch after planting.\nGood R., Wright G., Whinam J. & Hope G.
