  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA replicated, laboratory study in CanadaÂ found that an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nParasites have the potential to control gammarid populations by reducing production of offspring, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death. In the wild, parasite infections have been associated with rapid die-offs of natural populations of freshwater shrimps, with the invasive species being more vulnerable than native species (Kestrup et al. 2011).\nKestrup A.M., Thomas S.H., van Rensburg K., Ricciardi A. & Duffy M.A. (2011) Differential infection of exotic and native freshwater amphipods by a parasitic water mould in the St. Lawrence River. Biological Invasions, 13, 769-779."
