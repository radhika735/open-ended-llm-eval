  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFour of eight studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Australia, Canada, Costa Rica and the USA found that group-selection harvesting increased cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees. Two studies found it decreased understory species richness2 and biomass.Two studies found no effect on understory species richness and diversity and two found no effect of group-selection harvest on tree density and growth-rate.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGroup selection thinning, i.e. thinning by removing trees in groups, leaves open gaps is used as a conservation management practice to increase forest structural diversity."
