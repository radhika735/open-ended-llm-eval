  "action_title": "Restrict pedestrian access",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restricting pedestrian access to marshes or swamps.\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nWalking on marshes or swamps can damage their vegetation, soils and hydrology (e.g. Ross 2006; Woolfolk 1999). Pedestrians are a particular problem when they repeatedly walk on the same area e.g. in popular tourist sites, or when scientists make repeat visits to sample plots. To prevent this damage, pedestrian access to marshes and swamps could be reduced by interventions such as legislation, limits on visitor numbers, voluntary codes, signage and/or ensuring official paths are well maintained.\nRelated actions: Physically exclude pedestrians; Install boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling.                                          \nRoss P.M.
