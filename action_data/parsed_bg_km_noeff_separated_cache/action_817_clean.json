  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo before-and-after studies in France and Denmark found that pond deepening and enlarging or re-profiling resulted in the establishment of a breeding population of great crested newts or translocated garlic toads. Two studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the UK and Denmark found that pond deepening and enlarging or dredging increased a population of common frogs or numbers of calling male tree frogs.\nFour before-and-after studies in Denmark and the UK found that pond deepening, along with other interventions, maintained newt populations and increased populations of European fire-bellied toads or natterjack toads.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf ponds dry out, breeding habitat may be lost which could have a significant impact on amphibian populations. It may be possible to restore ponds by deepening or de-silting them. Re-profiling ponds can also make them more suitable for amphibians. Ponds should ideally contain a range of microhabitats, which can be achieved with a range of depths, an irregular shape and gently sloping sides to encourage a diversity of plants and invertebrates.\nStudies that investigated the restoration of ponds using a combination of interventions including deepening, de-silting or re-profiling ponds are discussed in ‘Restore ponds’."
