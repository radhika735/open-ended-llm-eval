  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of modifying a bottom trawl to raise parts of the gear off the seabed during fishing on marine fish populations. One study was in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia) and one was in the Atlantic Ocean (USA). \n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nReduction of unwanted catch (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one randomized and both controlled) in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Atlantic Ocean found that bottom trawls with parts of the gear raised off the seabed caught fewer unwanted sharks, other elasmobranchs and fish and fewer of three of seven unwanted fish species compared to conventional trawls.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n \nTrawling involves towing a trawl net through the water by one or more fishing vessels. Bottom trawl nets consist of various components, some of which are in physical contact with the seabed during fishing. These gear components can contribute to the catching process by forcing species to swim off the seabed and herding them into the net. The footrope, for example, consists of a rope or wire across the lower edge of the trawl mouth that creates weight to keep the trawl net on or near the seabed. The configuration of the footrope varies between trawls and is different between different seabed habitats and target species. Different footrope designs affect the catch composition (Hannah et al. 2003) and the extent to which the gear is in contact with the seabed and hence the amount of physical disturbance (Jones 1992). The trawl bridles are lines that attach the trawl to the otter boards, which keep the trawl net open during towing and also contribute to herding fish into the net. Raising such parts of the gear off the seabed, for example with floats, may therefore reduce seabed bottom contact and the amount of unwanted catch. Behavioural information may also be used to avoid catching certain species. For example, Krag et al. (2010) demonstrated how unwanted cod may escape beneath a trawl with its fishing line raised 60 cm above the seabed while targeted haddock are retained.\nFor related interventions describing other modifications to the overall design of different types or parts of trawl gear is summarized under ‘Fishing gear modification - Modify the design or configuration of trawl gear (mixed measures)’, ‘Change the size of the main body of a trawl net’, ‘Decrease the circumference or diameter of the codend of a trawl net’, ‘Modify the design or configuration of trawl doors’ and ‘Modify design or arrangement of tickler chains/chain mats in a bottom trawl’.\nHannah R.W. & Jones S.A.
