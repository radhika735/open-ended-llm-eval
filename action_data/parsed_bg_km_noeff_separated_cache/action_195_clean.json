  "action_title": "Relocate nests at harvest time to reduce nestling mortality",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA replicated controlled study from Spain found that clutches that were temporarily removed from fields during harvest and then replaced had higher hatching and fledging rates than control clutches. Effects were greater on clutches that were older when moved.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf nests are likely to be destroyed by machinery during harvest or mowing, it may be possible to move them and then return them after the danger has passed. If nests are extremely likely to be destroyed during harvest or mowing then it may be best to remove the chicks and hand-rear them. Studies on the effects of this intervention are found in the chapter on captive breeding and hand-rearing."
