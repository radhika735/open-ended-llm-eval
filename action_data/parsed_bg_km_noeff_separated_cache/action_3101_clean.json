  "action_title": "Add salt to control problematic plants: brackish/salt marshes",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly adding salt to control problematic plants in brackish/salt marshes. The study was in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nHeight (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a salt marsh in the USA found that adding salt to control invasive beardgrass Polypogon monspeliensis had no significant effect on the height the dominant native glasswort Salicornia subterminalis.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDirect and temporary application of salt or salty water to marshes, for example by spreading or spraying, may kill or reduce the growth of problematic plants that cannot tolerate high salinities. Salt may also be more cost effective than other control methods, such as hand removal or herbicide application (Kuhn & Zedler 1997). Caution: This action may have long-term and widespread impacts on native plants and other organisms, both in the focal site and nearby ecosystems (Alluvium 2013). So, it may be best to use short-term and targeted applications (Kuhn & Zedler 1997).\nFor this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.\nRelated actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes.\nAlluvium (2013) Investigation of Alternative Options to Control Phragmites at Reedy Lake.
