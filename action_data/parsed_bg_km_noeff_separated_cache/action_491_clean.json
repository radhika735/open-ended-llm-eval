  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nOilbirds Steatornis capripensis are a unique, nocturnal species in their own family Steatornithidae, related to nightjars, potoos and frogmouths. However, unlike their relatives oilbirds feed entirely on fruit and nest and roost in caves in northern and central South America. It is thought that the availability of nesting and roosting sites in these caves may limit populations, although increasing habitat destruction is also threatening the species (Thomas 1999).\nThomas, B.T. (1999) Family Steatornithidae (oilbird). Handbook of the birds of the world: Volume 5, Barn owls to hummingbirds (eds Hoyo, J, Elliott, A. & Sargatal, J.), pp. 244â€“252. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona."
