  "action_title": "Use alternative methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using alternative methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys on marine and freshwater mammal populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAirguns used for seismic surveys produce high intensity sounds that may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003). Using alternative ‘quieter’ methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys may reduce these impacts. For example, a method called marine vibroseis, which uses lower intensity sounds over a longer duration, may reduce some of the impacts on marine mammals (Richardson & Ellison 2013).\nGordon J., Gillespie D., Potter J., Frantzis A., Simmonds M.P., Swift R. & Thompson D. (2003) A review of the effects of seismic surveys on marine mammals. Marine Technology Society Journal, 37, 16–34.\nRichardson W.J. & Ellison W.T. (2013) Predicted relative effects of marine vibroseis versus airguns on marine mammals. Proceedings – 75th European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers Conference & Exhibition - Workshops, cp-349-00047."
