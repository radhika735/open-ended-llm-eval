  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies from the USA and Europe found reductions in consumption of eggs treated with various chemicals. A further ex situ study from the USA found that American kestrels Falco sparverius consumed fewer chicks when they were treated, but not to the point of losing body condition.\nThree studies from the USA found some evidence that treating eggs with some chemicals may have reduced predation of eggs after treatment stopped, orÂ  of untreated eggs, although two of these were only short term experiments and the third found that the effect was lost after a year. \nFour studies from the Europe and the USA found no evidence for conditioning, or a reduction in predation of wild (untreated) eggs.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf predators can be taught to associate unpleasant tastes with eggs and/or chicks, then they may stop predating them. This can be achieved either through treating eggs in nests (spraying eggs or the nest) or placing artificial nests in the environment with eggs injected with unpleasant chemicals (not possible with natural nests as it will kill eggs).\nThe effectiveness score shown here is based on an assessment of this evidence combined with the evidence from Use aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation by mammalian predators; therefore the assessment describes the evidence available for Using aversive conditioning to reduce nest predation."
