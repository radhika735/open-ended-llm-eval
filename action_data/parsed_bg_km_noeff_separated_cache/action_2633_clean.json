  "action_title": "Harvest timber outside mammal reproduction period",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of harvesting timber outside the mammal reproduction period.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTree-felling poses risks to woodland-dwelling mammals. For species with young in a nest or den, tree felling could cause death of these young through injury or abandonment. Planning timber harvesting for times outside the period when young are at their most vulnerable may reduce such direct casualties of felling operations."
