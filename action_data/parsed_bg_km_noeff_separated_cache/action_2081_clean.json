  "action_title": "Use cables and pipelines of smaller width",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using cables and pipelines of smaller width on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCommunication and power cables, and oil and gas pipelines, can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and habitat loss. Limits on the width of cables and pipelines could be set at the planning stage before laying them on the seabed. This may reduce the level of threat by limiting the extent of damage, and potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates."
