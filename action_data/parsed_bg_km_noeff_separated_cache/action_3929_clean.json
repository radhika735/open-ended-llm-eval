Six studies were in the UK, two were in Finland, and one was in each of Switzerland and Taiwan.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (9 STUDIES)\n\nCommunity composition (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in the UK and Finland found that grasslands restored from bare soil by seeding developed butterfly communities that were increasingly similar to existing high-quality grasslands over the first 10 years after establishment. The other study found that older grasslands established by sowing with competitive seed mixes had a greater proportion of specialist butterflies than newer grasslands sown with less competitive species which required re-seeding every 4–5 years.\nRichness/diversity (8 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies (including two paired studies) in Switzerland, the UK and Taiwan found that 4–5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had a greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK and Finland found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher species richness of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands established by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths, but species richness was higher on grasslands created &lt;10 years ago than on grasslands created &gt;20 years ago. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the species richness of large moths on a farm increased. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that over 10 years after restoration, the number of species of butterfly on seeded grassland remained similar each year.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (7 studies): Two of three replicated, paired, site comparison studies in the UK and Taiwan found that restored grassland had a higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland or unrestored crop fields, and a similar abundance to semi-natural grasslands, but abundance did not increase with time since restoration. The third study found that abandoned cropland had a similar abundance of butterflies to cultivated farms. Two of three replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and two site comparison studies) in the UK and Finland found that grasslands established by sowing grasses, legumes and other non-woody, broadleaved plants (forbs), or perennial grass mixes, had a higher abundance of butterflies (in one case including other pollinators) than grasslands established with grass-only mixes or less competitive species. The third study found that grasslands restored by sowing complex or simple seed mixes, or by natural regeneration, all had a similar abundance of caterpillars. One before-and-after study in the UK found that after the adoption of an Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme on a farm, including reverting arable land to permanent grassland, the abundance of large moths and five species of butterfly increased, but the abundance of two species of butterfly decreased.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLarge areas of grassland have been converted to arable land, leading to a loss of grassland-dependent species. Meadows can support a higher abundance and species richness of butterflies than arable land (Luppi et al. 2018). Restoring arable land to permanent grassland may recreate communities of invertebrates similar to those historically found in an area (Denning & Foster 2018).\nFor studies of short-term or rotational set-aside, see “Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland”. For studies on the restoration of species-rich grassland from intensively managed grassland, see “Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands (several interventions at once)”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by reducing stocking density”, “Reduce grazing intensity on grassland by seasonal removal of livestock” and “Reduce cutting frequency on grassland”. For studies on the restoration of abandoned grassland, see “Restore or create species-rich, semi-natural grassland”. For studies on grassland restoration outside of a farmland context, see “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore or create grassland/savannas”.\nDenning K.R. & Foster B.L.
