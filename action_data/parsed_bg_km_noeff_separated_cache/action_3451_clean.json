  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nFive studies examined the effects of creating long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. Three studies were in estuaries in southeast Australia and two were in a port in the Netherlands.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)\n\nOverall community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Australia and the Netherlands reported that long flexible habitats created on subtidal artificial structures supported macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate or fish species that were absent from on and around structure surfaces without flexible habitats.\nInvertebrate community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that creating long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures altered the non-mobile invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces.\nFish richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that creating long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on the fish species richness around structures, depending on fish presence when flexible habitats were created.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)\n\nOverall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Netherlands reported that long flexible habitats created on subtidal artificial structures supported higher combined macroalgae and invertebrate (mostly mussels) biomass than structure surfaces without flexible habitats, and found that deeper flexible habitats supported higher biomass than shallower ones.\nInvertebrate abundance (3 studies): Two of three studies (including two replicated, two controlled and one randomized study) in Australia and the Netherlands found that creating long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on the mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate abundance on and around structure surfaces, depending on the species group and survey week, or the flexible habitat length and density. One study reported that creating flexible habitats decreased the mussel abundance on structure surfaces but that the flexible habitats themselves supported higher biomass (mostly mussels) than the structure surfaces.\nFish abundance (2 studies): Two randomized, controlled studies (including one replicated study) in Australia found that creating long flexible habitats on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on the abundance of fishes or seahorses on and around structures, depending on the species and fish presence when flexible habitats were created, or the survey week.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): One replicated study in Australia reported that long flexible habitats created on subtidal artificial structures were used by seahorses.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Long flexible habitats’ are flexible protruding materials such as rope, ribbon or twine &gt;50 mm in length (modified from “Soft structures” in Strain et al. 2018).\nLong flexible habitats, such as macroalgal canopies and soft-bodied invertebrates, provide other organisms three-dimensional habitat space and refuge from predation in subtidal rocky habitats (Levin & Hay 1996; Smale et al. 2020). The size, density and material properties of flexible habitats are likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them and the spaces they create.\nSome organisms that form flexible habitats tend to be absent or sparse on artificial subtidal structures (Wilhelmsson & Malm 2008), although some readily colonize in suitable conditions. Artificial flexible habitats such as ropes or nets can be present on some structures, but are likely to be temporary and regularly disturbed (e.g. removed and replaced) when present. Long flexible habitats can be created on subtidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively. Material choice is important for creating flexible habitats, since some flexible materials are unlikely to persist in the marine environment, while those that do may become entanglement hazards or contribute to pollution if dislodged. Studies that investigate the effects of transplanting live soft-bodied organisms onto structures are not included here, but are considered under the action “Transplant or seed organisms onto subtidal artificial structures”.\nThere are bodies of literature describing the use of artificial flexible habitats to investigate the effects of structural complexity on ecological interactions in subtidal rocky habitats (e.g. Shelamoff et al. 2020), for artificial reefs or fish aggregation devices (e.g. Kellison & Sedberry 1998; Vega Fernández et al. 2009), and for bivalve or seaweed cultivation (e.g. Peteiro et al. 2007; Walls et al. 2019). There are also laboratory-based studies investigating species preferences for different flexible habitats (e.g. Hellyer et al. 2011). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on in situ conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of structures that are engineered to fulfil a primary function other than providing artificial habitats.\nSee also: Create short flexible habitats (1–50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures; Transplant or seed organisms onto subtidal artificial structures.\nHellyer C.B., Harasti D. & Poore A.G.B.
