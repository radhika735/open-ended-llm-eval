  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwenty-eight studies evaluated the effects of breeding tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles in captivity. Twelve studies were in the USA, four were in the Seychelles, two were in Madagascar, two were in an unknown location and one was in each of the Galápagos, Germany, Austria, Jersey, Italy, India, China and Myanmar.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (28 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (5 studies): Four studies (including one replicated study) in Madagascar, the Seychelles and the USA reported that captive breeding programmes produced 255 ploughshare tortoises, 40 and 140 giant tortoises, 75 juvenile radiated tortoises and 94 Madagascar big-headed turtle hatchlings. One study also reported that the captive population grew each year. One replicated study in Myanmar reported that the number of Burmese star tortoise hatchlings produced in captivity increased from 168 to over 2,000 over eight years.\nReproductive success (24 studies): Eighteen studies (including one replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA, the Galápagos, Germany, Austria, the Seychelles, Italy, India, China and an unknown location reported that females produced 0–25 clutches of 1–26 eggs, 65–78 eggs each/year or a total of 10–170 eggs. Three of these studies reported hatching success of 52–100%, four reported hatching success of 23–71%, three reported hatching success of 0–66%, 0–81% or 0–100% and six reported hatching success of 0–43% or 0–3 hatchings/clutch. One other study from the Seychelles reported that 0–75% of eggs from one of two mud turtle species hatched successfully. One of the studies also found that three of five eggs produced by a captive-bred tortoise hatched successfully. Two studies in Jersey and the Seychelles reported that only 3 Malagasy Flat-tailed tortoise eggs and 3–18 mud turtle eggs hatched successfully over 11–12 years. One study in Madagascar reported that most Madagascar big-headed turtle eggs laid in captivity were infertile. One study in the USA reported that hatching success of 2nd generation captive desert tortoises was 20–83%, whereas success for 3rd generation tortoises was 0–43%. One study in the USA found that hatching success for captive Bourret’s box turtle eggs was higher when incubated at 26–27°C compared to 28–29°C.\nSurvival (7 studies): Three studies (including one replicated study) in the USA, Austria and an unknown location reported that 2–4 captive-bred tortoises or turtles survived for at least 28 weeks to two years. One replicated study in Italy reported that all captive-bred spider tortoises survived to adult size. Two studies in the USA and Jersey reported that 25–30% of captive-bred tortoises died within 12–18 months. One study in the Seychelles reported that 70% of captive-bred mud turtles died during hatching\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (1 STUDY)\n\nOffspring sex ratio (1 study): One study in the USA reported that a captive breeding programme of radiated tortoises produced 67 females and eight males.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCaptive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions. The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.\nDue to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for other species groups.\nFor studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred reptiles see Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild."
