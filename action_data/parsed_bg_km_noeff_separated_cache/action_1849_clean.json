  "action_title": "Lobby, campaign or demonstrate to protect peatlands",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects of lobbying/campaigning/demonstrating for peatland protection on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation. Both studies reported effects, on unspecified peatlands, of the same campaign in the UK.\nPeatland protection (2 studies): Two studies in the UK reported that the area of protected peatland increased following pressure from a campaign group.\nBehaviour change (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following pressure from a campaign group, major retailers stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost.\nAttitudes/awareness (1 study): One study in the UK reported that following campaign pressure, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLobbying or peaceful demonstrations could put pressure on projects that threaten peatlands, preventing them from occurring or minimizing their impact. This section considers campaigns targeted at organizations such as businesses or governments. Specific actions include demonstrating on site, writing letters and social media campaigns.\nThe Peatlands Campaign Consortium was formed in 1990 by 10 UK conservation organizations. Its overall aim was to protect UK peatlands of conservation importance, with a focus on (a) on reducing peat extraction and use and (b) raising awareness of the importance of peatlands and the threats they face. Campaigning involved meetings with businesses, parliamentary debates, publishing reports and leaflets, organizing seminars, establishing a National Bog Day and placing education volunteers in garden centres (Rawcliffe 1998).\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: raise public awareness about peatlands.\nRawcliffe P.
