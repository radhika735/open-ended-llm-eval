  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n  \n\nTwo studies in Australia provide mixed evidence of the effect of freshwater bathing to reducing amoebic gill disease. One study found a reduction in numbers of amoebae on salmon gills persisting for up to 10 days after bathing. One replicated, controlled study found similar levels of amoebae in the gills of treated and untreated salmon.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAtlantic salmon cultured in commercial farms are at risk of contracting and transferring infectious bacterial diseases and other pathogens such as amoebic gill disease (AGD). Freshwater bathing aims to mitigate the risk of AGD by removing live ameobae from the gills."
