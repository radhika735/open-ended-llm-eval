  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of replacing blocks of vegetation after mining or peat extraction. One study was in a bog and one was in a fen.\nPlant community composition (2 studies): Two studies, in a bog in the UK and a fen in Canada, reported that transplanted vegetation blocks retained their peatland vegetation community. In the UK, the community of the transplanted blocks did not change over time. In Canada, the community of replaced vegetation blocks remained similar to an undisturbed fen.\nVegetation cover (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the UK reported that bare peat next to translocated bog vegetation developed vegetation cover (mainly grass/rush). Sphagnum moss cover declined in the translocated blocks. One site comparison study in Canada reported that replaced fen vegetation blocks retained similar Sphagnum and shrub cover to an undisturbed fen.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves replacing blocks of peatland vegetation on a bare peat surface, such as that left behind after mining subsurface peat. In this way, the surface vegetation may recover much more quickly than if reassembled through colonization or planting individual plants. Blocks of introduced vegetation with an intact surface layer may help to regulate moisture.\nThe vegetation blocks should be cut from the upper 30 cm of natural peatlands. They may be cut from the mined peatland before mining begins, then kept aside during mining. This retention and replacement approach has its origins in the German Bunkerde concept (Money & Wheeler 1999) but is also known as ‘peat-block reclamation’ (Cagampan & Waddington 2008). Alternatively, vegetation blocks may be cut from another peatland area and transplanted to the damaged area, as in ‘bofedal transplants’ used in South America. Clearly, this damages the donor bog (although blocks could be sourced from peatlands destined to be destroyed by development). \nKey peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated action: rewetting, because peatlands are often drained to allow peat extraction.\nCagampan J.P. & Waddington J.M.
