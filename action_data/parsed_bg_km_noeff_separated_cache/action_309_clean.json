  "action_title": "Use signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance at nest sites",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nSix studies (two replicated and controlled, two before-and-after and two small studies) from across the world found increased numbers of breeders, higher reproductive success or lower levels of disturbance in waders and terns following the start of access restrictions or the erection of signs near nesting areas. One Canadian study involved the use of multiple interventions.\nA before-and-after study from the USA found that a colony of black-crowned night herons Nycticorax nycticorax was successfully relocated to an area with no public access.\nOne small study from Europe and one replicated and controlled study from Antarctica found no effect of access restrictions on the reproductive success of eagles or penguins, respectively.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nIf most disturbance to nesting birds is accidental, then simply warning the public that there are birds present, or restricting access at certain times of the year may help reduce disturbance and the abandonment or destruction of nests. Conversely, if disturbance is coming from people attempting to see nests or birds, then alerting the public to their presence with signs could be counter-productive."
