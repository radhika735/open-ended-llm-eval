  "action_title": "Skunk cabbage:  Public education",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNo evidence was captured on the impact of public education programmes on control of skunk cabbage.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMost occurrences of skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus have resulted from human introduction as an ornamental plant.Â  In addition, where skunk cabbage has been purposefully planted for example along watercourses, and along the margins of ponds and artificial lakes, management activity such as movement of soil and pond cleaning may spread the seeds, and thereby increase the spread of this non-native plant.\nPublic education programmes can potentially be used to reduce the horticultural trade in skunk cabbage and reduce the spread of mature plants that have been introduced."
