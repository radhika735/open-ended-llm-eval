  "action_title": "Amphibians: Separate sexes in non-breeding periods",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, before-and-after study in AustraliaÂ found that clutch size of frogs increased when sexes were separated in the non-breeding periods, alongside providing female mate choice, playing recorded mating calls and allowing females to increase in weight before breeding.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany species of amphibian lead largely solitary lives during non-breeding periods in the wild but may be permanently housed in mixed-sex groups in captivity. In some species, burrows or nests are constructed before the breeding season. Separating the sexes outside of the breeding season allows the males or females time to construct these burrows. The timing of introducing the females to the males alongside could promote breeding."
