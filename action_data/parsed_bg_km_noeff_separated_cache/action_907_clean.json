  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One replicated study from Mexico found higher microbial biomass when crop residues were retained.  \nErosion: One review found reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced soil erosion. One replicated site comparison from Canada found mixed effects on soil physical properties, including penetration resistance and the size of soil aggregates. One replicated study from the USA found that tillage can have mixed results on soil erosion when crop remains are removed.\nSoil organic matter: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher soil organic carbon and nitrogen when residues were retained. One trial found this only when fertilizer was also applied.\nYield: Two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China found higher yields when residues were retained. One trial found this only when residue retention was done combination with fertilizer application and no-tillage.\n \nSoil types covered: clay, loam, sandy-loam, silt loam.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCrop residues are the remains of the crop after the valuable part has been harvested. For this intervention, residue retention is considered to be crop remains which are left in the field, rather than crop remains which are brought in from elsewhere and added to the soil (see ‘Amend the soil with fresh plant material or crop remains’). Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles held together by moist clay, organic matter (such as roots), organic compounds (from bacteria and fungi) or fungal hyphae (long, branching structures of a fungus). Some soil particles fit closely together, some do not, creating different-sized spaces. These spaces (or pores) within and between soil aggregates can store air and water, microbes, nutrients and organic matter. Large aggregations of particles retain the most nutrients. Soil penetration resistance is the soil’s ability to withstand penetration by water or roots. Often with low penetration resistance comes higher hydraulic conductivity, which is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through pore spaces in the soil. A healthy soil has good hydraulic conductivity. Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil and is measured by levels of carbon or nitrogen in the soil."
