  "action_id": "1949",
  "action_title": "Manage grazing regimes to increase invertebrate prey",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing grazing regimes to increase invertebrate prey on bat populations.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nGrazing regimes can be designed to maintain pasture in good condition and increase the abundance of invertebrate prey for bats. Bats may also forage over herds of grazing livestock, particularly at moderate stocking densities (e.g. Ancillotto et al. 2017).\nAncillotto L., Ariano A., Nardone V., Budinski I., Rydell J. & Russo D. (2017) Effects of free-ranging cattle and landscape complexity on bat foraging: implications for bat conservation and livestock management. Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, 241, 54–61."
