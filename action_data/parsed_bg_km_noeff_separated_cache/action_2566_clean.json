  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nThree studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating grassland. One study each was in Portugal, the USA and Hungary.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Hungary found that grassland restored on former cropland hosted a similar small mammal species richness compared to native grassland.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\n\nAbundance (2 studies): A controlled, before-and-after study in Portugal found that sowing pasture grasses into areas cleared of scrub did not increase European rabbit densities. A replicated, site comparison study in Hungary found that grassland restored on former cropland hosted a similar abundance of small mammals compared to native grassland.\nSurvival (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that seeding with grassland species as part of a suite of actions including mechanical disturbance and herbicide application increased overwinter survival of mule deer fawns.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMany grasslands have been lost to agricultural intensification through conversion to cropland or through agricultural abandonment, whereby colonization by woodland or scrub may occur. Agri-environment schemes in Europe and North America support preservation or restoration of grasslands for agricultural, conservation and carbon storage reasons. Restoration of these grasslands may benefit some mammal species that are associated with them.\nSee also: Restore or create savannas."
