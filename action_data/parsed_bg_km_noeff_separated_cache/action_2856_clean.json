  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using baited lines instead of nets for shark control. One study was in the Indian Ocean (South Africa) and one in the South Pacific Ocean (Australia).\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean found that using baited lines instead of nets increased the survival of entangled common and bottlenose dolphins.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\nOTHER (2 STUDIES)\n\nReduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean found that baited lines used for shark control had fewer entanglements of dolphins, whales and dugongs than nets.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMethods of controlling problematic species may have negative impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. For example, shark control nets, which are deployed to protect the public at swimming beaches, may entangle and kill non-target species, such as marine mammals (Gribble et al. 1998). Using alternative methods to capture and remove problematic shark species, such as baited lines, may reduce the risk of marine mammal entanglement and mortality.\nGribble N.A., McPherson G. & Lane B.
