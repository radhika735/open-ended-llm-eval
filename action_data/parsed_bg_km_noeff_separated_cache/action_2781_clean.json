  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMarine and freshwater mammal species threatened by trade are protected under the CITES agreement (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which aims to regulate the international trade of endangered species. However, it is the responsibility of each participating country to adopt its own national legislation to ensure the regulations are implemented, and in some countries illegal trade continues (e.g. Lee & Nijman 2015).\nLee P.B. & Nijman V. (2015) Trade in dugong parts in Southern Bali. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 95, 1717–1721."
