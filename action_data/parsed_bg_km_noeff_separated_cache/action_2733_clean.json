  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of releasing fish that are carrying eggs or live young on marine fish populations. \n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removing fish that are carrying/brooding eggs (females or males) or live young (such as many sharks) not only kills the adult but prevents successful spawning or rearing of the young and limits the overall reproductive potential of the population. Releasing fish with eggs or live young may help sustain fish populations and protect the hatching or rearing of young fish."
