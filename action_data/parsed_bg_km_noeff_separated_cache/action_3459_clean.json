  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nDefinition: ‘Short flexible habitats’ are flexible protruding materials such as rope, ribbon or twine 1–50 mm in length (modified from “Soft structures” in Strain et al. 2018).\nShort flexible habitats, such as understory macroalgal blades, turfs and soft-bodied invertebrates, provide other organisms refuge from desiccation and temperature fluctuations during low tide in intertidal rocky habitats (Kim 2002). They can support high biodiversity (Thrush et al. 2011) but can also dominate space and have negative effects on other species (O’Brien & Scheibling 2018). The size, density and material properties of flexible habitats are likely to affect the size, abundance and variety of organisms that can use them and the spaces they create.\nSome organisms that form flexible habitats tend to be absent or sparse on intertidal artificial structures (Firth et al. 2016), although some readily colonize in suitable conditions. Artificial flexible habitats such as ropes or nets can be present on some structures, but are likely to be temporary and regularly disturbed (e.g. moved and replaced) when present. Short flexible habitats can be created on intertidal artificial structures by adding material, either during construction or retrospectively. In addition to potential biodiversity benefits, flexible habitats may offer some bioprotection for the underlying substrate, with potential to reduce weathering and enhance the durability of engineering materials (Coombes et al. 2013). Material choice is important for creating flexible habitats, since some flexible materials are unlikely to persist in the marine environment, while those that do may become entanglement hazards or contribute to pollution if dislodged. Studies that investigate the effects of transplanting live soft-bodied organisms onto structures are not included here, but are considered under the action “Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures”.\nThere is a body of literature describing the use of artificial turfs as collectors to measure larval supply and settlement in rocky intertidal habitats and to investigate the effects of structural complexity on ecological interactions (e.g. Kelaher 2003; Morris et al. 2018; von der Meden et al. 2015). These studies are not included in this synopsis, which focusses on in situ conservation actions to enhance the biodiversity of marine artificial structures. \nSee also: Create long flexible habitats (&gt;50 mm) on intertidal artificial structures; Transplant or seed organisms onto intertidal artificial structures.\nCoombes M.A., Naylor L.A., Viles H.A. & Thompson R.C.
