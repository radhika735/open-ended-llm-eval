  "action_title": "Restore habitat in area predicted to have suitable climate for shrubland species in the future",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of restoring habitat in areas predicted to have a suitable climate for shrubland species in the future on shrublands.\n\n'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe creation or restoration of habitat in areas that are predicted to have suitable climates in the future has previously been suggested as a method to counter the negative effects of climate change (Harris et al 2006). Doing this may help to maintain shrubland habitat and species as climate changes.\nHarris, J.A., Hobbs, R.J., Higgs, E. & Aronson, J. (2006) Ecological restoration and global climate change. Restoration Ecology, 14, 170-176."
