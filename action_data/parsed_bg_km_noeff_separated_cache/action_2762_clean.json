  "action_title": "Modify vessels to reduce risk of physical injury to mammals",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying vessels to reduce risk of physical injury to mammals.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCertain vessel modifications may reduce the severity of injuries to marine or freshwater mammals in the event of a collision. This could include installing propeller guards, such as cages, that provide a physical barrier between the propeller blades and an animal (Van Waerebeek et al. 2007).\nVan Waerebeek K., Baker A., Félix F., Gedamke J., Iñiguez M., Sanino G.P., Secchi E.R., Sutaria D., Helden A.V. & Wang Y. (2007) Vessel collisions with small cetaceans worldwide and with large whales in the Southern Hemisphere, an initial assessment. Latin American Journal of Aquatic Mammals, 6, 43–69."
