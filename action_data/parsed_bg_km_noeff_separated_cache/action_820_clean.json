  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with a statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas. One before-and-after study in the UK found that a common frog population increased but common toads decreased following the protection of a pond during development.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe effectiveness of protecting areas for amphibian populations is rarely assessed. For example, since 2005, Conservation International and the Amphibian Specialist Group have partnered in the creation of 14 new protected areas in Africa, Asia and Latin  America. These cover 22,000 ha and support 55 Threatened or endemic amphibian species (Moore 2011). However, the effectiveness of these protected areas has not been monitored.\nA modelling study of the distribution of endemic Mexican amphibians found that 65% of species may have less than 20% of their range protected and 20% are not protected by governmental Protected Areas (Ochoa-Ochoa et al. 2009). Private and community conservation areas were also found to play a role in protecting endemic Mexican species, with 73% of species represented within those areas (Ochoa-Ochoa et al. 2009). Another modelling study reported that the range of 50% of threatened amphibian species in Australia was not considered to be adequately covered by the protected area system (Watson et al. 2010).\nMoore R.
