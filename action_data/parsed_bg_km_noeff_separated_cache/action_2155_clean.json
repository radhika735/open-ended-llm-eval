  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using native species instead of non-native species in aquaculture systems on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nNon-native species are known to negatively affect local native communities (Arthur et al, 2009; Campbell & Hewitt 2008; Molnar et al. 2008). Non-native species are commonly used worldwide for aquaculture purposes due to their economic value (for instance, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea (also known as Magallana) gigas is importantly produced in the UK despite not being native). Using native species for aquaculture instead of non-native species removes the risk of introducing non-native species into an area, either intentionally (from at sea culture) or accidentally (as escapees from hatchery facilities; Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013; Campbell 2009; Campbell 2011). Culturing native species may also reduce pressure on native species populations by displacing the harvest effort from native stocks to aquaculture stocks (Andriahajaina & Hockley 2007).\n \nAndriahajaina & Hockley (2007) The potential of native species aquaculture to achieve conservation objectives: freshwater crayfish in Madagascar.
