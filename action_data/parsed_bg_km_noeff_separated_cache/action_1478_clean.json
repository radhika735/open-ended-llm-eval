  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis intervention involves implementing no-hunting community policies or traditional hunting bans. These differ from national and international policies in that (authorities within) local communities rather than government staff enforce such policies/bans.\n            The enforcement of local taboos that forbid the killing of certain primate species is discussed under ‘Strengthen/support/re-install traditions/taboos that forbid the killing of primates’, and installing community control of anti-poaching activities is discussed under ‘Implement community control of patrolling, banning hunting and removing snares’."
