  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining undisturbed patches during thinning operations. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)\n\nUse (2 studies): Two randomized, replicated, controlled studies (one also before-and-after) in the USA found that snowshoe hares and tassel-eared squirrels used retained undisturbed forest patches more than thinned areas.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThinning is a forestry practice that involves the selective removal of trees to reduce tree density and improve the growth rate, health and timber quality of remaining trees. Thinning has been done historically to maximize timber production but may have ecological benefits, such as opening up the canopy and allowing more light in, which may benefit some species. However, some species may benefit from the shelter available within retained undisturbed forest patches."
