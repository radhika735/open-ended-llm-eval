  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of providing training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers. The study was in the UK.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nBehaviour change (1 study): One study in the UK reported that 82% of landowners that received advice about applying for the Rural Priorities agri-environment scheme submitted applications, there was a 90% application success rate, and &gt;3,000 ha of farmland were managed for the marsh fritillary.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThere are a wide variety of actions which may be implemented on farmland to try and improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (see actions under “Agriculture & Aquaculture”), and agri-environment schemes are increasingly including options and packages designed to support pollinators, including butterflies and moths. Even on nature reserves, getting the right balance of habitat management can be difficult. For species with particular habitat requirements which are difficult to achieve, such as a structural diversity of grassland swards, training events for land managers and conservation staff may help to improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (Parsons 2004).\nParsons M.S. (2004) The United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan moths - selection, status and progress on conservation. Journal of Insect Conservation, 8, 95–107."
