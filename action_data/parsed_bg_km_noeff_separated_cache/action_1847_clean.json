  "action_title": "Raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of engaging volunteers to manage or monitor peatlands on knowledge, behaviour, peatland habitats or peatland vegetation.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nVolunteers may be engaged in projects from practical management to citizen science monitoring. Projects that actively engage volunteers to manage or monitor peatlands could indirectly increase awareness of peatlands and their value to the public, change public perceptions towards peatlands and create a sense of ownership over peatlands (Evely et al. 2011). Volunteer activities should be carried out sustainably, for example minimizing impact by trampling and employing biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species.\nKey peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.\nRelated actions: other interventions to raise public awareness about peatlands (generally, problematic species or wild fire). The effects of specific interventions done by volunteers are considered separately.\nEvely A.C., Pinard M., Reed M.S. & Fazey L. (2011) High levels of participation in conservation projects enhance learning. Conservation Letters, 4, 116–126."
