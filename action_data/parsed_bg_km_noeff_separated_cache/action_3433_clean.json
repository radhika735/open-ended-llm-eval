  "action_title": "Add carbon to soil before or after seeding/planting",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies examined the effects of adding carbon to soil before or after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Both studies were in the USA.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY (0 STUDIES)\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE (2 STUDIES)\n\nSown/planted species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding carbon to soil after sowing seeds either reduced or did not alter the density of sown forb species.\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCarbon amendments, such as sugar and/or sawdust, can be added to soil to reduce the nitrogen available to plants. This may reduce competition from fast-growing non-native and invasive plants, which may increase the survival and growth of native species after seeding or planting.\nThe studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding carbon to soil before or after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an untreated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’."
