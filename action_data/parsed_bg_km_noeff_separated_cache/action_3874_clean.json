  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replanting native trees in logged areas. The study was in Ghana.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nRichness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in GhanaÂ found that nine years after an area was replanted with native trees after logging it had similar species richness but lower diversity for two of three metrics compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest.\n\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nLogging of native forest or plantations causes a dramatic change in the structure of the landscape. Planting native trees in logged areas of natural forest may help to speed up the process of succession and redevelopment of the forest structure, while planting native trees in logged plantations may encourage the restoration of native forest in the area. Note that many species of butterfly and moth do well in early successional woodland after disturbance, but these species may represent a different community to those found in established, pristine forest."
