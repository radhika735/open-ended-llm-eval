  "action_title": "Use collar-mounted devices to reduce predation",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo replicated randomised and controlled studies in the UK and Australia found that significantly fewer birds were returned by cats wearing collars with various anti-hunting devices, compared to controls.\nA replicated, randomised and controlled study from the UK found no significant differences between different devices.\nBoth UK studies found that collars were easily lost.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCat collars can be modified to carry either simple bells or more complex sonic alerts which scare birds before cats can catch them. Another option is a ‘bib’ which hangs in front of the cat’s legs, preventing them from hunting effectively."
