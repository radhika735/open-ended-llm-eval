  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of installing underpasses beneath ski runs. This study was in Australia.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\n\nUse (1 study): A replicated study in Australia found that boulder-filled crossings beneath ski slopes were used by seven small mammal species.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nInfrastructure and land management associated with the ski industry has, on balance, a negative effect on mammals (Sato et al. 2013). One source of impact is habitat fragmentation, through construction of ski runs across previously forested slopes. Underpasses could facilitate mammal movements between habitat patches, especially if they mimic previous ground conditions across rocky slopes.\nÂ \nSato C.F., Wood J.T. & Lindenmayer D.B.
