  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne study evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing along railways. This study was in Norway.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)\n\nSurvival (1 study): A before-and-after study in Norway found that fencing eliminated moose collisions with trains, except at the fence end.\n\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nCollisions with trains can cause substantial numbers of mammal deaths (e.g. Gundersen & Andreassen 1998). Barrier fencing alongside railways may reduce access to railway tracks by mammals and, thus, reduce the number of mammal-train collisions.\nGundersen H. & Andreassen H.P. (1998) The risk of moose Alces alces collision: A predictive logistic model for moose-train accidents. Wildlife Biology, 4, 103â€“110."
