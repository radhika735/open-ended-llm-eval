  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nFitting collars with reflective tape on animals to increase their visibility to drivers was considered in Canada for reintroduced wood bison Bos bison (Huijser et al. 2007). In Finland, a spray that reflects vehicle headlights was applied to the antlers of reindeer with the aim of making the animals more visible to motorists and so reducing collisions with vehicles (https://www.ibtimes.co.in/finnish-reindeer-given-glowing-antlers-to-prevent-accidents-539561).\nHuijser M.P., McGowen P., Fuller J., Hardy A., Kociolek A., Clevenger A.P., et al.
