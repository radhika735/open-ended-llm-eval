  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nNine studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping to restore or create brackish/salt marshes. Seven studies were in the USA. One was in Belgium. One was in Italy. Two of the studies were based on the same marsh.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n\nOverall extent (2 studies): One paired, site comparison study in an estuary in the USA reported that vegetation coverage on reprofiled sediment, after 2–3 years, did not clearly differ from natural marsh areas in two of three comparisons. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA reported that reprofiled coastal areas, where submerged sediment had been pushed into ridges, contained a smaller proportion of salt marsh habitat than nearby natural areas.\nOverall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two studies in Belgium and Italy simply quantified plant species richness in marshy areas that had been reprofiled or excavated (sometimes along with other interventions), for up to 23 years after intervention began.\nCharacteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study in an estuary in the USA simply reported the number of salt marsh plant species that colonized an area of reprofiled sediment over seven years.\n\nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n\nOverall abundance (2 studies): One site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA reported that a marsh created by reprofiling sediment (along with other interventions, including planting) had lower overall vegetation cover than a nearby natural marsh, after three growing seasons. One study in an estuary in Belgium simply quantified the cover of vegetation that colonized an area of reprofiled sediment over five years.\nIndividual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Of four site comparison studies in the USA, three reported that the dominant herb species was typically less abundant – in terms of cover or biomass – in marshes that had been reprofiled (sometimes along with other interventions) than in natural areas, after 2–5 years. The other study reported that density of the dominant herb species in a reprofiled (and planted) marsh was within the range of nearby natural marshes, after five years. Two studies in the USA and Belgium simply quantified cover of individual plant species over five years after reprofiling (sometimes along with other interventions).\n\nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n\nOverall structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that the layout of salt marsh habitat (e.g. patch size and complexity) differed between reprofiled coastal areas, where submerged sediment had been pushed into ridges, and nearby natural areas.\nHeight (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that California cordgrass Spartina foliosa was shorter in a 5-year-old reprofiled marsh (also planted with cordgrass) than in nearby natural marshes.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis action involves large-scale reprofiling or landscaping, aiming to restore or create marshes. This includes excavating large basins (&gt;8 ha or &gt;280 m diameter), moving soil/sediment from the site into levees/berms/impoundments, removing unnatural hills or levees, filling in deep depressions and altering the elevation/slope of coastal areas. In other words, this intervention aims to restore wetland hydrology (how wet the soil is and when it is wet/flooded) by adjusting the ground surface relative to the water table or sea. Soil from existing marshes or swamps might be imported as part of relandscaping efforts, but we consider this as a separate action.\nCaution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).\nRelated actions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes; Raise water level to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes; Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Excavate pools; Create mounds or hollows; Remove surface soil/sediment; Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure; Reprofile/relandscape before planting.\nCampbell D.A., Cole C.A. & Brooks R.P.
