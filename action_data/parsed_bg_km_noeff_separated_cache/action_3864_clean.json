  "action_title": "Use education programmes and local engagement to reduce persecution or exploitation of species",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using education programmes and local engagement to reduce persecution or exploitation of butterflies and moths.\n\n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nAlthough many species of butterflies and moths are among the most popular insects, others are maligned as crop pests or clothes-eaters, or misunderstood simply because they are nocturnal. Increasing public understanding of the importance and beauty of butterflies and moths can counteract this, reducing the frequency of negative behaviours towards them, or even raising funds for their conservation. On the other hand, some rare species of butterfly and moth are still threatened by collecting, and in this case, education may be used to raise awareness of the species’ plight with the aim of changing behaviour. This action is for studies which test the impact of either type of education programmes on butterfly and moth populations."
