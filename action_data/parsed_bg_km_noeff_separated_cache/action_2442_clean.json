  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of using tree nets to deter mammals from fruit crops to reduce human-wildlife conflict.\n\nâ€˜We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nTree nets can be used to close off tree canopy pathways or other access in order to protect fruit crops from being accessed by mammals. Netting is cheap to install but can be labour intensive for subsistence farmers. If successful in protecting fruit crops, use of nets could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of mammals."
