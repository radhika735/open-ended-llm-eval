  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying harvest methods of macroalgae on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.\n\n \n‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThe commercial harvest of macroalgae (e.g. kelp) can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through removal of the plant itself, direct physical damage and removal of invertebrates, or through disturbance to the seabed (Pirker 2002; Stagnol et al. 2016). The harvest method can be modified in an attempt to prevent such negative impacts. For instance, harvesting macroalgal blades rather than mechanically removing the whole plant can reduce disturbances to the seabed and retain some benefit of macroalgal canopy (Levitt et al. 2002). Increasing the time between consecutive harvests can also potentially help reduce the pressure and allow for natural recovery. Similarly, harvesting patches of macroalgae rather than entire areas can potentially allow natural recolonization of subtidal benthic invertebrates from nearby unharvested patches.\n \nLevitt G.J., Anderson R.J., Boothroyd C.J.T. & Kemp F.A.
