  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nA controlled, randomized, replicated study from Canada found that intercropping with trees resulted in a higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: sandy-loam.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nThis agroforestry intervention grows crops between hedgerows or tree lines planted at regular intervals across crop fields or along slope contours. Hedges may be pruned and the foliage used as mulch or green manure on the adjacent crop alleys. The technique may control weeds and insect pests in a number of ways, for example by modifying the fieldâ€™s climate, disrupting pest movement and weed growth, increasing crop vigour, providing habitat for natural enemies and using the insecticidal properties of hedgerow foliage. Studies that plant/allow trees around the edges of fields are included in 'Plant new hedges'. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and receive a supply of carbon from the plant, while they give an enhanced supply of nutrients back to the plant, improving plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005). A phylotype is a way of classifying an organism by its phylogenetic (or evolutionary) relationship to other organisms.\nBardgett R. (2005) The Biology of Soil: A Community and Ecosystem Approach.
