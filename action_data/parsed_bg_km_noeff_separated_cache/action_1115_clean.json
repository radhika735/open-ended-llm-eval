  "action_title": "Asian clams: Change salinity of the water",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA controlled, replicated laboratory study conducted in the USA found that Asian clams were killed (100% mortality) when exposed to high salinities (18-34‰).",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nElevated levels of salt in the water can cause osmotic stress in Asian clams Corbicula spp., leading to mortality. Increasing the salinity of a waterbody to a very high level is likely to have significant effects on non-target species."
