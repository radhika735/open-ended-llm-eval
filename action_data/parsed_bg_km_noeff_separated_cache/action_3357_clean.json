  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nTwo studies evaluated the effects – on trees/shrubs typical of freshwater wetlands – of pruning their roots before planting. Both studies were in the USA. One study was in a laboratory.\n\nVEGETATION COMMUNITY\n \nVEGETATION ABUNDANCE\n \nVEGETATION STRUCTURE\n \nOTHER\n\nSurvival (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in created wetlands in the USA reported that root-pruned red maple Acer rubrum seedlings had a higher survival rate than unpruned seedlings, 1–2 years after planting. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a laboratory in the USA found that root-pruned and unpruned Nuttall oak Quercus nuttallii seedlings had similar survival rates, 108 days after planting.\nGrowth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a laboratory in the USA found that root-pruned and unpruned Nuttall oak Quercus nuttallii seedlings grew in height by a similar amount over the first 108 days after planting.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nPlants can be stressed by the process of planting into a new site. Pruning before planting can encourage the growth of new, nutrient-assimilating feeder roots close to the plant: within the zone of roots that will be moved with the plant (Swackhamer & Sellmer 2007). It can also make planting process quicker and easier (Allen & Kennedy 1989).\nTo be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of pruned and unpruned plants. Studies that simply report the performance of pruned plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.\nAllen J.A. & Kennedy H.E.
