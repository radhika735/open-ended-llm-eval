  "action_title": "Certify forest concessions and market their products as ‘primate friendly’",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nWe found no evidence for the effects of certifying forest concessions and marketing their products as ‘primate friendly’ on primate populations.\n\n'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nMore than fifty certification standards already exist worldwide aiming to ensure the sustainable logging of forests (e.g. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)). Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed as defined by a particular standard, and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale. None of these certifications, however, directly relate to primates or their habitats. This intervention involves the certification of wood logged by companies that adhere to strict impact minimization/mitigation/compensation schemes to promote the conservation of key primate populations and their habitat. Certified products could then be marketed as ‘primate friendly’ and sold at a premium."
