  "action_title": "Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nA long-term replicated controlled trial in Switzerland found that annual spring burning of calcareous grassland did not increase plant species richness relative to abandoned plots, after 15 years.\n\n\nA replicated controlled trial in Northern Ireland found that heather moorland subject to a single burn had more plant species eight years after the management, than control unburned plots.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\n\nThis intervention may involve controlled burns to stimulate heather re-growth, modify the heathland/grassland plant communities or create a patchwork of heather of different ages.\nSee also ‘Maintain upland heath/moorland’ for studies that used burning as a management tool to maintain upland heath/moorland, and ‘Manage heather by swiping to simulate burning’ for studies that use swiping as an alternative to burning."
