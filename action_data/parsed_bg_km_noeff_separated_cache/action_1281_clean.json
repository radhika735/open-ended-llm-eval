  "action_title": "<i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use hydrogen peroxide to control plants",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\n\nOne controlled study in the UKÂ using tank trials found that hydrogen peroxide did not control Crassula helmsii.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nHydrogen peroxide is a chemical that has herbicidal properties, but does not produce harmful chemicals that persist in the environment (Fowler & Barrett 1986). Therefore it could be used to locally control C. helmsii, with the advantage that it is non-toxic and leaves no residue.\nFowler M.C. & Barrett P.R.F. (1986) Preliminary studies on the potential of hydrogen peroxide as an algicide on filamentous species. Proceedings EWRS/AAB 7th International Symposium on Aquatic Weeds, 113-118."
