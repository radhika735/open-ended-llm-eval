  "action_title": "Amend the soil with bacteria or fungi",
  "key_messages": "Key Messages:\nBiodiversity: One randomized, replicated trial from India showed that adding soil bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity.\nSoil organic matter: One controlled, randomized, replicated trial from Turkey found increased soil organic matter content in soil under mycorrhizal-inoculated compost applications\nYield: Two randomized, replicated trials (including one also controlled) from India and Turkey found higher crop yields.\nSOIL TYPES COVERED: clay-loam, sandy-loam.",
  "background_information": "Background information and definitions:\nSoil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a group of fungi that live around the roots of plants. By living together, the fungi and host plant benefit each other: the fungi can live in a habitat without having to compete for resources and gain a supply of carbon from the plant, while they provide an enhanced supply of nutrients to the plant which improves plant growth, the ability to reproduce and tolerance to drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonise a wide variety of host plants, including grasses, herbs, agricultural crops and legumes (Bardgett 2005).\nBardgett R.
