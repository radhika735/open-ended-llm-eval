2921: Create artificial habitat for marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves creating artificial habitats for marine and freshwater mammals. For example, artificial reefs are structures intentionally built on the seafloor using natural or man-made materials, such as rocks or concrete blocks. These structures may attract a variety of marine life and form reef ecosystems, providing a foraging resource for predatory marine mammals. However, some man-made materials used for artificial reefs, such as scrap tyres, may have toxic effects (Collins et al. 2002). High concentrations of fish at artificial reefs may also attract fishing activities and increase the risk of mammal entanglement in fishing gear.
For a study that restored an existing reef with boulders, see Restore habitat for marine and freshwater mammals. See also Leave anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating artificial habitat for marine and freshwater mammals.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
