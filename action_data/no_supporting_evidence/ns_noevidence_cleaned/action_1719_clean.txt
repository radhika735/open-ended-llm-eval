1719: Remove residential or commercial development from peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Removing urban areas, industrial facilities or tourist sites that have been built on or near peatlands could allow the vegetation to recover.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: rewetting, because peatlands are often drained to allow development or are dried out by drainage of sites nearby; habitat creation and restoration interventions for formerly developed land.

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of removing residential or commercial development from peatlands.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
