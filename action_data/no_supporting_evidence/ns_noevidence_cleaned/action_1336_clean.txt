1336: Primates: Modify ingredients/nutrient composition seasonally (not daily) to reflect natural variability
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Primates display a good variation of behavioural flexibility, allowing them to adjust to changes in food availability in the wild. This is critical for the survival of leaf eating and fruit eating primates that live in small forests, where food resources are lower than in large and continuous forests. In captivity it is possible to adjust their diet accordingly by giving seasonal leaves, fruit and vegetables with the aim of promoting activity levels.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of modifying ingredients/nutrient composition of primate feed seasonally (not daily) to reflect natural variability.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
