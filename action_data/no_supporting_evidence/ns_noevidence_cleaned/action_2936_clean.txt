2936: Involve local communities in marine and freshwater mammal conservation projects
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
When local communities are involved in conservation projects, they may have a greater interest in ensuring the long-term sustainability of conservation efforts. The engagement of local communities may also reduce persecution of marine and freshwater mammals. One study in Mexico found that local communities were successfully involved in recording sightings and rescuing threatened West Indian manatees Trichechus manatus manatus, although the outcomes for the manatee population were not reported (Rodas-Trejo et al. 2008).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of involving local communities in marine and freshwater mammal conservation projects on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
