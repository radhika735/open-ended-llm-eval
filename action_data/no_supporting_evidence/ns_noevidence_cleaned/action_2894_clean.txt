2894: Install stormwater traps or grids
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Urban debris can enter marine and freshwater environments in unprocessed stormwaters running off land via stormwater conduits and drainage systems (Armitage & Rooseboom 2000). Litter can negatively affect marine and freshwater mammals through entanglement, ingestion and the introduction of chemical contaminants (Kühn et al. 2015). Stormwater traps or grids are designed to prevent litter from entering stormwaters and may therefore reduce the amount of litter reaching marine and freshwater environments (Armitage 2007).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of installing stormwater traps or grids on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
