2611: Use selective trapping methods in hunting activities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hunting using traps (such as snares, leg-hold traps or cage traps) can result in capture of rare, threatened or protected non-target species mammal (e.g. Andreasen et al. 2018). Measures to reduce such “bycatch” might include setting a weight-sensitive release catch, placing traps in particular areas (or avoiding other areas) or only using specific baits.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on non-target mammals of using selective trapping methods in hunting activities.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
