1868: Amphibians: Allow temperate amphibians to hibernate
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hibernation is a natural process for some amphibians from colder regions, in which they burrow underground or at the bottom of ponds. They dramatically slow down their metabolic processes to conserve their energy over winter to mate in spring. Breeding is also seasonal and can be triggered by longer periods of sunlight, changing temperatures or increased/decreased rainfall. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of allowing temperate amphibians to hibernate.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
