2015: Prevent pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Measures may be taken to prevent pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses. This could include leaving a buffer around watercourses, restricting the use of plant and machinery in proximity to watercourses and installing appropriate drainage systems to divert contaminated water away from watercourses. See also ‘Plant riparian buffer strips’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of preventing pollution from agriculture or forestry from entering watercourses on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
