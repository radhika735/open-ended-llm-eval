Background information and definitions:
Access to vulnerable areas in forests can be controlled by re-routing paths of prohibiting access to roads and paths for example. Studies looking at path and sign creation are discussed in “Create managed paths/signs to contain disturbance”.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of re-routing paths, controlling access or closing paths on forests.
