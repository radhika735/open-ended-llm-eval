3533: Establish protocols to reduce collisions
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Protocols involving visual observation networks, dedicated onboard observers, and predictive modelling may be employed to reduce vessel collisions with sea turtles by alerting skippers to the presence of turtles and allowing alternative navigation routes to be used.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of establishing protocols to reduce collisions on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
