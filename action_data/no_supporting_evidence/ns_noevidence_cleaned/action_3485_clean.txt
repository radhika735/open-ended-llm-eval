3485: Engage landowners and volunteers to manage land for reptiles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Only around 15% of land and 4% of oceans are protected worldwide (UNEP WCMC & IUCN 2016), which means that it is vital to engage effectively with landowners so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain reptile populations. Volunteers can also make a valuable contribution to the management of habitats for reptiles, on private and public land. In some cases, the long-term success of habitat management can depend on the involvement of local people.
As well as the direct effects from habitat restoration, volunteer programmes help raise awareness about reptiles and the threats that they face. For example, a study found that participants with high levels of engagement in conservation projects learned more (Evely et al. 2011). For interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage or monitor reptile populations see actions relating to Education and awareness raising.
