2744: Minimize food waste at aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding of fish at aquaculture systems may attract marine or freshwater mammals. Minimizing food waste may discourage mammals from foraging around anti-predator nets and becoming entangled. This may also reduce human-wildlife conflict at aquaculture facilities, as well as pollution caused by excess feed and feed additives.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
