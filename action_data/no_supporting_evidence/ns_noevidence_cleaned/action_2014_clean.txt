Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many organic pesticides made from natural substances are less harmful than synthetic pesticides. For studies that involve using organic pest control alongside other interventions, see ‘Use organic farming instead of conventional farming’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using organic pest control instead of synthetic pesticides on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
