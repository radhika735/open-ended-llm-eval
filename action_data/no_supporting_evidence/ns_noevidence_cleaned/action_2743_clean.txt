2743: Modify anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anti-predator nets may be placed around fish pens or cages to physically exclude marine or freshwater mammals to reduce predation. However, such nets may entangle mammals, causing injury or death (e.g. Díaz López et al. 2007).  Reducing mesh size, using stiffened or tensioned materials, and/or enclosing nets at the bottom may reduce the risk of entanglement (Kemper et al. 2003). These measures may also deter mammal predation more effectively thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
