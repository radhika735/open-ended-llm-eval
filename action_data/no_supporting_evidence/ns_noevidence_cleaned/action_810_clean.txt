810: Protect habitat along elevational gradients
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Where suitable habitat remains, it may be possible to protect large enough areas that would allow amphibians to migrate with climatic changes and any changes in habitat that result.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of protecting habitat along elevational gradients on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
