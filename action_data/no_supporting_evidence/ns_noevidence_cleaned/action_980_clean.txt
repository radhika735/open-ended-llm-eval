980: Install hop-overs as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A ‘hop-over’ typically consists of tall vegetation planted on either side of a road/railway with overhanging branches that create a continuous canopy over the gap. The aim is to guide bats across roads/railways at a safe height above traffic. There is evidence that bats will cross roads at greater heights in the presence of high canopy cover or roadside embankments (Russell et al. 2009, Berthinussen & Altringham 2012). However, experiments using two parallel screens at natural gaps in bat flight paths in Denmark had mixed results, with some bats continuing to fly at hazardous heights or abandoning their commuting routes (Christensen et al. 2016).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of hop-overs as road/railway crossing structures for bats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
