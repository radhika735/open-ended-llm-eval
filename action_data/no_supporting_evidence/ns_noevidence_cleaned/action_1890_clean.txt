1890: Amphibians: Leave infertile eggs at spawn site as food for egg-eating larvae
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some species of amphibian feed on infertile eggs in their first weeks of life at the spawn site. This behavior can only occur in captivity if unfertilized eggs are left in the enclosure. By mimicking a diet tadpoles may experience in the wild, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided.
