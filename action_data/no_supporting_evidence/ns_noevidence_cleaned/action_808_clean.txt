808: Artificially shade ponds to prevent desiccation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Where it is not possible to shade ponds naturally with tree canopy cover for example, artificial shades could help to reduce temperatures and prevent drying.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of artificially shading ponds to prevent desiccation on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
