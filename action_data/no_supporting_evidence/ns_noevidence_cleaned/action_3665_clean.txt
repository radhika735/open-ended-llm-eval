3665: Protect specific habitat structures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Protection of specific habitat structures (e.g. hibernacula sites) or a specific resource (e.g. food resource) may be a more effective conservation intervention than more general habitat protection especially in urban or peri-urban settings.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting specific habitat structures on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
