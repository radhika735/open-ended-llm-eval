969: Remove turbine lighting to reduce bat and insect attraction
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Lights placed on wind turbines may attract insects and foraging bats, increasing the risk of collision. However, one study in the USA found fewer bat fatalities at turbines lit with flashing red aviation lights than at unlit turbines (Bennett & Hale 2014), and three other studies in the USA found no difference (Johnson et al. 2004, Jain et al. 2010, Baerwald & Barclay 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing turbine lighting to reduce bat and insect attraction on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
