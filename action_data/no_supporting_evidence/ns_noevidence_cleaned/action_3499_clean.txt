3499: Use fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There is a risk to reptiles from becoming trapped, falling into mining pits or being electrocuted in mining or energy production facilities. Fencing may be used around such sites to deter reptile entry. As well as reducing direct risks to reptiles, if successful the intervention may also reduce the need to carry out lethal control of reptiles on such sites.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using fencing to prevent reptiles from accessing facilities.
