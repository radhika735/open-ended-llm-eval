2737: Specify a size range of capture for commercially fished species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. Removal of the smaller or larger sizes of fish from a population reduces the overall reproductive potential by killing either the immature fish before they have reached maturity or the larger fish that produce the highest numbers of eggs. Setting specific fish size ranges that allow harvesting of intermediate sizes may help protect the overall reproductive potential by avoiding fishing mortality of the smallest and largest individuals.
For similar interventions, see ‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species’ and ‘Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of specifying a size range of commercially retained fish species on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
