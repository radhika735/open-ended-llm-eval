812: Add nutrients to new ponds as larvae food source
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Providing supplementary food may help to increase survival rates of colonizing amphibians and therefore increase the probability of breeding populations establishing. However, providing supplementary food could also increase predator populations and therefore increase predation pressure.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of adding nutrients, such as zooplankton, to new ponds on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
