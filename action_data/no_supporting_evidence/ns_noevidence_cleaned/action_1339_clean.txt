1339: Primates: Provide food at natural (wild) feeding times
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is specifically for nocturnal and diurnal primates. Feeding them during daylight hours is not suitable and therefore provisions must be put in place in captivity to allow them to express natural feeding behaviours at night or if preferred at dawn and dusk.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of providing food to primates at natural (wild) feeding times.
