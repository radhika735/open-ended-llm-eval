3644: Introduce and enforce regulations for reptile watching tours
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Introducing regulations for reptile watching tours may reduce disturbance. This may involve setting limits on group sizes, observation times and the number of visits each day, particularly when tours involve visiting remote islands by boat. Interactions with reptiles during tours, such as feeding, may also be regulated. Enforcement of regulations may be required if compliance is low (e.g. Whitt & Read 2006).
