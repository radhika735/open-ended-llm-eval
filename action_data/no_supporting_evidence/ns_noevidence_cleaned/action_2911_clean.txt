2911: Implement rapid response plans for stranded mammals following extreme events
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Extreme weather events, such as storms and cyclones, may cause mass stranding of marine mammals. Rapid response plans may provide an overview of possible rescue protocols, as well as details of which authorities to contact, should a stranding event occur. The aim of such plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of the response to improve the chances of survival of stranded mammals.
