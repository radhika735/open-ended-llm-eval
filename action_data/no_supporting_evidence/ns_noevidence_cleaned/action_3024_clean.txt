3024: Install boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Walking on marshes or swamps can damage their vegetation, soils and hydrology (e.g. Ross 2006; Woolfolk 1999). Pedestrians are a particular problem when they repeatedly walk on the same area e.g. in popular hiking areas, in tourist sites/nature reserves, or when scientists repeatedly visit sample plots. Installing boardwalks or designated paths can prevent physical contact with the marsh or swamp (Vickery 1995) – assuming people stay on them.
Caution: Preservatives leaching from timber may harm vegetation and wildlife. Boardwalks will also shade and kill the vegetation beneath. Paths can compress sediments and alter water flow patterns, above and below the wetland surface.
Related actions: Restrict pedestrian access; Physically exclude pedestrians.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of installing boardwalks or paths to prevent trampling in marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
