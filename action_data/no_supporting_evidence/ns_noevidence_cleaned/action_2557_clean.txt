2557: Remove flood water
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events, including flooding. Flood waters may cover habitat normally used by mammal species. For example, more than half of China’s mammal species were found to be exposed to risks from flooding (Ameca y Juárez & Jiang 2016). In addition to direct casualties from effects of water (such as drowning) flood water may alter the habitat, for example through changes to vegetation. Furthermore, mammal mortality may be higher when flood water persists for longer (Wuczyński & Jakubiec 2013). Enabling rapid removal of flood water, such as through creating drainage routes, may lessen such impacts.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of removing flood water.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
