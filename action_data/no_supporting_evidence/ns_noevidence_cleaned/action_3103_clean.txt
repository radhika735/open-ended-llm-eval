3103: Add salt to control problematic plants: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Direct and temporary application of salt or salty water to swamps, for example by spreading or spraying, may kill or reduce the growth of problematic plants that cannot tolerate high salinities. Salt may also be more cost effective than other control methods, such as hand removal or herbicide application (Kuhn & Zedler 1997). Caution: This action may have long-term and widespread impacts on native plants and other organisms, both in the focal site and nearby ecosystems (Alluvium 2013). So, it may be best to use short-term and targeted applications (Kuhn & Zedler 1997).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly adding salt to control problematic plants in brackish/saline swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
