3073: Reduce intensity of prescribed burning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the effects of different intensities of prescribed burning, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve marsh or swamp vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared prescribed burns at different intensities (e.g. by adjusting fuel load before burning) but with the same frequency and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). Note that studies comparing areas that remain unburned to areas that become burned, at any intensity, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Change season/timing of prescribed burning (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the intensity of prescribed burning in marshes or swamps (or burning them at different intensities).
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
