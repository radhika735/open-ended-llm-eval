2165: Treat ballast water before exchange
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Ballasting is the process by which sea water (ballast water) is taken in and out of the ship when the ship is at port or at sea. Ballast water can therefore contain species from one location taken-up during water intake, which are then accidentally released in a new environment during de-ballasting (water release). Ballast water is one of the major processes of introduction of non-native, invasive and problematic species (Barry et al. 2008; Hewitt 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Molnar et al. 2008). Treating ballast waters before exchange can potentially eliminate most or all risks of accidental introduction of non-native, invasive or other problematic species (Reise et al. 1998). Treating ballast waters can be done through either mechanical–physical or chemical processes, for instance using high-performance filters, oxidizing or disinfecting chemicals, or Ultra-Violet radiations (Werschkun et al. 2014).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of treating ballast water before exchange on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
