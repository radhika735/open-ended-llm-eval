Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retaining in-field trees and developing agro-forestry systems has the potential to retain on-farm biodiversity. There has been considerable work on the importance of agro-forestry systems for biodiversity in general and especially birds, particularly in the tropics, where traditional farming practices often use such systems.
