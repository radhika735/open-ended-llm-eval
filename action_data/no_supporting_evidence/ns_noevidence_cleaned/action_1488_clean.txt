Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood cutting is a management technique designed to avoid clear-cutting, but to provide even-aged timber. It involves cutting trees in a series of cuttings, allowing new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using shelter wood cutting instead of clear-cutting on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
