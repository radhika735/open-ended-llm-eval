109: Erect predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

As well as direct predation on adults, predators can have a devastating impact on bird populations through predating eggs and chicks too young to defend themselves or run away. Species such as hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus or other birds can all affect bird populations in this way and in many cases it is not desirable or practical to remove these species.
This intervention involves erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders to exclude predators.


Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of erecting predator-proof fencing around important breeding sites for waders on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
