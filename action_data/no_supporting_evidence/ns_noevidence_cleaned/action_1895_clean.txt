1895: Amphibians: Allow adults to attend their eggs
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some amphibian parents defend their clutches, carry them on their backs or directly nurse their young (caecilians). By providing the right conditions for these species to carry out natural parenting behaviour it may be possible to increase tadpole survival.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of allowing adults to attend their eggs.
