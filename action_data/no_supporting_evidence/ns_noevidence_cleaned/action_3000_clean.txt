3000: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting vegetation less often (e.g. every two years instead of every year) will allow more time for it to recover from the disturbance, potentially growing taller and more densely. It might give plants long enough to mature and reproduce. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.
For this action, “reduction” includes stopping harvest altogether. Note that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the frequency of harvest in brackish/saline swamps (or harvesting at different frequencies).
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
