1468: Implement sustainable harvesting of primates (e.g. with permits, resource access agreements)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention controls primate off-take rates so that the number of individuals that are killed does not exceed the number of individuals that are born to ensure that people can continue to benefit from the resource and that the population survives in the long-term. To do this, respective authorities typically give out a fixed number of hunting permits, beyond which no further hunting is allowed. Obtaining permission to harvest primates may, or may not involve paying money, depending on the type of agreement between the hunter and the wildlife authority.  

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of implementing sustainable harvesting of primates on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
