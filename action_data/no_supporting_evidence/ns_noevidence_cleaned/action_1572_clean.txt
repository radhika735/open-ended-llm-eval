1572: Parrot’s feather: Removal using water jets 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Water jets can be used to remove plants from sediments such as sand, peat and clay (Hussner et al. 2017). Plants are unrooted and can then be removed from the water surface. Compared to conventional mechanical harvesting methods, the use of water jets produces a lower number of plant fragments. However, as with other mechanic methods, the use of water jets to wash out plants leads to high water turbidity (Hussner et al. 2017). The control of parrot’s feather by means of suction dredging is presented in ‘Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal’ and the use of manual and mechanical harvesting to control parrot’s feather are respectively discussed in ‘Manual harvesting (hand-weeding)’ and ‘Mechanical harvesting or cutting’. Control via mechanical excavation is discussed under ‘Mechanical excavation’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of water jets to control parrot’s feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
