983: Replace or improve habitat for bats around roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There is evidence that the effect of a road on bat diversity is reduced in better quality bat habitat (Berthinussen & Altringham 2012). Replacing lost habitat and improving habitat quality (for example by planting trees, hedges, woodland or creating wetlands) around roads or railways may reduce the negative impact on bats.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of replacing or improving habitat around roads/railways on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
