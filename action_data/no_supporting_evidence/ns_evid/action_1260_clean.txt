Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fertilizer application can be used to improve the establishment of planted trees after forest restoration.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies in Canada and Portugal found that applying fertilizer after planting increased the size of the planted trees. One randomized, replicated, controlled study in Australia found that soil enhancers including fertilizer had a mixed effect on seedling survival and height.
Three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled study) in France and Australia found no effect of applying fertilizer on the size and survival rate or health of planted trees.
