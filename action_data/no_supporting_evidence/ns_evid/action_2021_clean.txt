2021: Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Red lighting may have a reduced effect on bats compared to lighting of other colours, as bat vision is more sensitive to shorter wavelengths (blue and ultraviolet light) than longer wavelengths (red light) (Müller et al. 2009). However, a study in Latvia found that migratory bats may be attracted to red lighting, which could have negative consequences (Voigt et al. 2019).
For similar interventions, see ‘Use ‘warm white’ rather than ‘cool’ LED lights’ and ‘Use ultraviolet filters on lights’.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of red lighting on bat populations. Two studies were in the Netherlands and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that red lighting resulted in higher activity (relative abundance) for one of three bat species groups than white or green lighting. One site comparison study in the Netherlands found that culverts illuminated with red light had similar activity of commuting Daubenton’s bats as culverts illuminated with white or green light.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)         

Behaviour (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that more soprano pipistrelles emerged from a roost when lit with red light than when lit with white light, but no difference was found between red and blue lights.
