263: Remove earth wires to reduce incidental bird mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Earth wires act to protect transmission wires against lightning, by dispersing excessive electricity. They are normally positioned either above or below the transmission wires, increasing the vertical height of wires and therefore the chances of collisions. In addition, earth wires tend to be thinner than transmission wires and so less visible, which, when they are positioned above transmission wires, increases the chances of collisions as birds climb to avoid the transmission wires.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study and a literature review describe significant reductions in collision mortalities of cranes Grus spp. and grouse Lagopus spp. following the removal of earth wires.
