1873: Amphibians: Provide multiple egg laying sites within an enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A choice of egg laying sites may be offered which vary in humidity, temperature, water level or protection from predation. This can often be done by using inexpensive, readily accessible natural items. Mimicking an amphibian’s natural environment in captivity, to meet species specific needs, could help improve breeding success. 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Australia found that frogs only bred once moved into an indoor enclosure which had various types of organic substrate, allowed temporary flooding, and enabled sex ratios to be manipulated along with playing recorded mating calls.
One small, replicated, before-and-after study in Fiji found that adding rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes to an enclosure, as well as a variety of substrates, promoted egg laying in frogs.
