3732: Create or restore rock outcrops
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Rock outcrops are home to a diverse range of highly specialised species (Goldingay & Newall 2017) but may be removed or degraded. Retaining rocky outcrops or structures is important for rock-dwelling reptiles as rocks provide a variety of microhabitats, including crevices, overhangs and suitable temperature shelter sites (Michael et al. 2010). Where rocks or rock piles have been removed they may be rebuilt and restored, and sometimes artificial rocks are used.
For studies that provide artificial cover or artificial shading for reptiles, see Create artificial refuges, hibernacula and aestivation sites or Threat: Climate change and severe weather – Provide artificial shade for individuals and Provide artificial shade for nests or nesting sites.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of creating or restoring rock outcrops on reptile populations. All five studies were in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in Australia found that areas restored with artificial rocks had a higher abundance of adult velvet geckos and similar numbers of juveniles compared to unrestored areas.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in Australia found that in areas restored with artificial rocks, juvenile velvet geckos had higher survival rates than in unrestored areas.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that some restored rocky outcrops were recolonized by pink-tailed worm-lizards. One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that constructed rock outcrops were used by two snake and six lizard species at least as often as natural outcrops. Two replicated studies (including one randomized study) in Australia found that artificial rock outcrops were used by two lizard and one snake species and six lizard and two snake species. One study also found that unshaded artificial rocks were used more frequently by velvet geckos than shaded ones.
