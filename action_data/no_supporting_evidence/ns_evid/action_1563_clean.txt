1563: Educate local communities about primates and sustainable use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Through passing knowledge on to communities living in/near primate habitat and raising their awareness about primate conservation, this intervention aims to develop changes in people’s behaviour that will benefit wild primate populations. Anticipated effects may include people adopting strategies for more sustainable resource use, making use of alternative meat protein sources (Wilkie et al. 2005, Junker et al. 2015), refusing to keep primates as pets (Akparawa 2006) or trade wild primates.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Cameroon found that numbers of drills increased after the implementation of an education programme, alongside one other intervention.
