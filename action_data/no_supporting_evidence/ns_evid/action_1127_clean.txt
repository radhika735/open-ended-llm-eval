1127: Floating pennywort: Chemical control using herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Application of chemical herbicides may offer a localised tool for management of floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides provided regulatory approvals are in place.  It is possible that efficacy will be enhanced by use of agents called adjuvants to bond the herbicide to the leaf surface, and the most effective adjuvants may show seasonality.  For example, an information sheet published in the UK suggests that applications of 4-6 L/ha in 200 L water with an adjuvant called TopFilm at 1.2 L/ha work up to the middle of July whereas applications of 4–6 L/ha with a Codacide Oil adjuvant work from July onwards (Newman & Duenas 2010).

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated study in the UK found that the herbicide 2,4-D amine applied at 4.2 kg/ha achieved near to 100% mortality, compared with the herbicide glyphosate applied at 2.2 kg active ingredient/ha (without an adjuvant) which achieved  negligible mortality.
