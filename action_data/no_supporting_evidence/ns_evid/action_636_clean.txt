636: Release birds as adults or sub-adults, not juveniles
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most captive-bred birds are released as juveniles as adults may have become too conditioned to life in captivity. Under some circumstances, however, adults or sub-adults may survive better.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated studies found that malleefowl Leipoa ocellata, houbara bustards Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii and cackling geese Branta hutchinsii released as sub-adults, not juveniles had higher survival rates.
A replicated study from New Zealand found lower survival for black stilts Himantopus novaezelandiae released as sub-adults, compared with juveniles.
Two replicated studies from Hawaii and Saudi Arabia found lower survival for Hawaiian geese Branta sandvicensis and bustards released as wing-clipped sub-adults, compared with birds released as juveniles. 
Three replicated studies found no differences in survival between ducks, vultures and ibises released at different ages, but a second study of the vulture release programme found that birds released when more than three years old had lower reproductive success than birds released at an earlier stage.
