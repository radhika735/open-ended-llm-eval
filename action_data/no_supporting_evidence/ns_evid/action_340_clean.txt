340: Mow or cut reedbeds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reedbeds were traditionally cut in much of Europe to provide thatch for housing and this practice continues in some countries. Cutting reeds like this changes the composition of the reedbeds, resulting in higher spring water levels and higher reed biomass (due to increased regrowth) than in uncut reedbeds (Poulin & Lefebvre 2002). A comparison of cut and uncut reedbeds in southern France found that there was also a higher abundance of food arthropods in cut reeds, although lower abundances of birds in summer (Poulin & Lefebvre 2002).
 

Key Messages:

Of three studies captured, one controlled study from the Netherlands found that warblers nested at lower densities in cut areas of reeds. Productivity and success did not vary between treatments.
An unreplicated study from Denmark found that geese grazed at the highest densities on reedbeds cut 5–12 years previously.
One replicated study investigated changing water levels in addition to cutting reeds in the UK and found that management did not affect great bittern breeding productivity but did appear to delay territory establishment.
