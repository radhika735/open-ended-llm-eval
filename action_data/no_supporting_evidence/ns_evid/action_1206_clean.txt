1206: Prevent livestock grazing in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Livestock grazing changes the habitat indirectly by changing soil properties and directly by the removal of vegetation. High grazing pressure may change plant diversity mainly by decreasing the abundance of palatable herbaceous species. It can also cause degradation of forest understory and reduce tree regeneration. Moderate grazing has less negative effects and may increasing shrubby vegetation height. Removing livestock grazing from forests may increase species diversity (Rook et al. 2004). Other studies that aim to reduce the detrimental effects of grazing are discussed in ‘Use wire fences within grazing areas to exclude livestock from specific forest sections'.

Key Messages:

Two of three studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Brazil, UK and Costa Rica found that preventing livestock grazing increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants. One study found mixed effects.
One site comparison study in Israel found that preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings.
