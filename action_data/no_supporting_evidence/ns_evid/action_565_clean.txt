565: Restrict certain pesticides
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Certain agricultural pesticides and chemicals may have detrimental effects on farmland wildlife. This intervention involves restricting the use of certain chemicals either by using less harmful alternatives or limiting the extent of their use.
See also: ‘Reduce fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide use generally’.

 

Key Messages:

A small scale study in the UK found that      using the fungicides Propiconazole and Triadimefon reduced chick food      insect abundance less than using Pyrazophos. A replicated, controlled      trial in Switzerland found that applying metaldehyde slug pellets in a 50 cm band      along the field edge adjacent to wildflower strips provided equivalent      crop protection to broadcasting the pellets across the whole field.
