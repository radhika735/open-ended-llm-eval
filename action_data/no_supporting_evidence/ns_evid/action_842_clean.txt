842: Close roads during seasonal amphibian migration
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Road traffic can have significant effects on amphibian populations, particularly where their annual migration routes between overwintering and breeding sites cross roads. In some areas, roads can be closed to protect important migration routes.
One study showed that reducing traffic on minor roads by creating a highway prevented fragmentation of populations of palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus but not midwife toads Alytes obstetricans (Garcia-Gonzaleza et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated study) in Germany found that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences.
