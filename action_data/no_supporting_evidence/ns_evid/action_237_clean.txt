237: Protect nests from livestock to reduce trampling 
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
As well as altering vegetation (see 'Exclude grazers from semi-natural habitats'), livestock can also reduce the breeding success of ground-nesting birds by trampling nests.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from the Chatham Islands, New Zealand found that the population of Chatham Island oystercatcher increased following several interventions including the erection of fencing around individual nests.
A replicated, controlled study in Sweden found that no southern dunlin nests were trampled when protected by cages; some unprotected nests were destroyed.
