3642: Use signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The effects of summer (e.g. Moore et al. 2006) or winter (Sato et al. 2013) human recreational activity on reptiles can be negative (Larson et al. 2016). Different reptile species may tolerate different levels of disturbance, but it may lead to behaviour changes (Nyhof et al. 2015), nest abandonment (Moore et al. 2006), physical damage to reptiles or nests, or the displacement of individuals or populations.  For vulnerable species or nests it may be possible to reduce the impacts of human disturbance using signs or access restrictions in areas subject to high use. Reducing access may also help reduce the risk of human introduction of non-native plants, animals or disease.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using signs and access restrictions to reduce disturbance. This study was in Turkey.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Turkey found that in an area with signs where sea turtle nests were fenced, nests had higher hatching success than nests from areas with no fencing or signs.
