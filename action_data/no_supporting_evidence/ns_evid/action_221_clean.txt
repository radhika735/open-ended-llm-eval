221: Provide short grass for waders
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife, with short vegetation allowing birds access to the ground for foraging and potentially reducing predation risk. However, high vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats (see Raise mowing height on permanent grassland).
 

Key Messages:
A replicated UK study found that common starlings and northern lapwings spent more time foraging on short swards, compared to longer grass, and that starlings captured more prey in short grass.
