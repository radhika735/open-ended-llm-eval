193: Leave refuges in fields during harvest 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
During mowing and harvesting operations, ground-nesting birds frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible. If mowing/harvest occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave the birds trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. However, if unharvested refuges are left in fields then it is possible that chicks and adults will remain in them and survive.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in France found that fewer gamebirds came into contact with mowing machinery when refuges were left in fields than when they were not left.
A review from the UK found that Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis did not nest at higher densities in uncut refuges than in the rest of the fields.
