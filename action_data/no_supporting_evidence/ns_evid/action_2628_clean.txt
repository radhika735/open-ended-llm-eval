2628: Install overpasses over waterways
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Waterways can separate populations of a species or provide barriers to movements. Artificial waterways (such as canals and aqueducts) can disrupt movements between previously connected habitat. This may result in genetic isolation of populations (e.g. Corlatti et al. 2009) or drownings, if animals attempt to cross waterways that have steep sides. Crossing points may be installed for use of animals in an attempt to maintain connectivity and free movement between sites or habitats.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing overpasses over waterways. One study was in the USA and one was in Spain.

Use (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated, one a site comparison) in the USA and Spain, found that bridges and overpasses over waterways were used by desert mule deer, collared peccaries and coyotes and by a range of large and medium-sized mammals.
