455: Restrict certain pesticides or other agricultural chemicals for birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Certain agricultural chemicals such as DDT, diclofenac and strychnine are now know to be extremely harmful to birds, either by direct poisoning, or interfering with reproduction. Many of these chemicals are now restricted or prohibited, but many others still remain in use. For example, some organophosphates such as monocrotophos are used to control insect pests and have caused mass poisoning incidents in raptors and cranes Grus spp. (Goldstein et al. 1999; Pain et al. 2004).

Key Messages:
A small scale study found that Pyrazophos reduced chick food abundance more than other foliar fungicides. A before-and-after study from Spain found that the population of griffon vultures Gyps fulvus increased in the study area following multiple interventions including the banning of strychnine.
