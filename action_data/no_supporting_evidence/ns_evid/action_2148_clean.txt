2148: Increase the mesh size of pots and traps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). To try to minimise the amount of unwanted catch from this type of fishing, the size of the mesh used to construct the pots/traps can be increased, to increase the likelihood of unwanted species or smaller/younger individuals of the economically targeted species escaping (Broadhurst et al. 2014). This may potentially help reduce unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrate species and benefit their populations.
Evidence related to the use of other “bycatch reduction devices” on pots and traps are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of increasing the mesh size of pots and traps on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study took place in the Corindi River system (Australia).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Corindi River system found that traps designed with larger mesh appeared to reduce the proportion of unwanted undersized mud crabs caught, compared to conventional traps of smaller mesh.
