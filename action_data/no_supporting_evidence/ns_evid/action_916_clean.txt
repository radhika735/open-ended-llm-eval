Key Messages:

Two replicated studies in Norway found similar final weight gain between salmon that were fed diets containing fish meal only or a krill meal substitute. When the krill were de-shelled, growth rates were closer to salmon fed fish meal, compared to leaving the krill whole.
Feed conversion ratios were found to be similar in both the fish meal and krill meal diets.
The number of aerobic bacteria in the hindgut of salmon fed fish meal and krill meal were higher and composition of the bacterial flora was different.
