1151: Control birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds can consume seeds or physically damage trees. However, insectivorous birds may also control invertebrate herbivore populations. Some territorial species (such as bell-miners) may also displace other insectivorous birds and hence affect the impact of invertebrates on forests.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled study in Australia found that removing bell-miners from narrow-leaved peppermint forests did not improve the health of the trees in the forest.
