1315: Primates: Scatter food throughout enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
More natural foraging conditions can be stimulated by scattering food throughout enclosures and hiding food in materials covering the flooring (e.g. straw) instead of in bowls or trays. The aim is to increase the amount of time that primates are active in captivity.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after and one before-and-after study in the USA found that scattering food throughout the enclosure increased feeding and exploratory behaviours in rhesus macaques and reduced abnormal behaviours in chimpanzees and aggression in lemurs.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that when food was scattered throughout the enclosure more foraging was seen and activity levels increased in gorillas.
