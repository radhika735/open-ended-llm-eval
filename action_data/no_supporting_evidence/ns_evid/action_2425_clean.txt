2425: Train and support local staff to help reduce persecution of mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Carnivores may be killed by farmers where they feel that their livestock are threatened. National laws or policies protecting wild mammals may be difficult to enforce at a local level. Local staff, from among the same communities as the farmers, may be able to gain more respect and to work more closely with farmers to find ways to reduce losses to predators without carrying out lethal control.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of training and supporting local staff to help reduce persecution of mammals. This study was in Kenya.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A replicated, before-and-after study in KenyaÂ found that employing local tribesmen to dissuade pastoralists from killing lions and to assist with livestock protection measures, alongside compensating for livestock killed by lions, reduced lion killings by pastoralists.
