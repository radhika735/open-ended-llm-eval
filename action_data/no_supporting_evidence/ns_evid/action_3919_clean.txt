3919: Manage vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
As perennial crops, vineyards form large areas of consistent agricultural habitat across Mediterranean-type landscapes. Like other perennial crops, this creates opportunities to manage vineyards as complete ecosystems, by providing the resources which butterflies and moths need within the crop. This could include encouraging native plant species to grow around the vines, altering the timing or frequency of management such as pruning and tillage, or reducing the application of chemicals to the vines or surrounding habitat.
For studies which test reductions in chemical application alone, see “Threat: Pollution”.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of managing vineyards to benefit butterflies and moths. One study was in each of the USA and Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in the USA and Spain found that grass strips between vine rows had a greater species richness of butterflies than the vine rows themselves, and vineyards managed with fewer chemicals had a greater species richness of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards. The other study found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a similar species richness of butterflies to conventionally managed vineyards.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that vineyards managed to encourage native plants, and where insecticide was rarely used, had a greater abundance of butterflies than conventionally managed vineyards.
