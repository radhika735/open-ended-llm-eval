2586: Cull disease-infected animals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
When mammal populations are threatened by disease, one potential action is to remove contact between diseased and disease-free animals. However, it is rarely attempted, possibly due to ethical and ecological concerns (Woodroffe 1999).
