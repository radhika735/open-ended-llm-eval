2450: Use scent to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Predatory mammals often mark their home ranges with scent, especially by selecting sites for depositing faeces and urine. If artificially placing such scent marks can constrain predators to particular areas and, in particular, to avoid areas where livestock are kept, this might reduce predation of livestock. If effective, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of these predators.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of using scent to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Botswana.

OTHER (3 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (3 studies): Two of three studies (including one replicated, before-and-after study), in the USA and Botswana, found that applying scent marks from unfamiliar African wild dogs and grey wolves restricted movements of these species. The other study found that applying scent marks from coyotes did not restrict their movements.
