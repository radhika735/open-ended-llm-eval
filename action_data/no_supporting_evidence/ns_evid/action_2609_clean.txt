2609: Prohibit or restrict hunting of particular sex/ breeding status/age animals
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Within some hunted populations of mammals, certain age or sex classes are favoured targets for hunters. This can result in altered population structures which can be detrimental to breeding success for example (e.g. Torres-Porras et al. 2014). Management of game mammals may, therefore, involve imposing specific hunting restrictions, so as to reduce or prohibit harvests of particular sex or age classes.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of prohibiting or restricting hunting of particular sex, breeding status or age animals. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Reproduction (2 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies, in the USA, found that limiting hunting of male deer did not increase the numbers of young deer/adult female.
Population structure (1 study): A replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that limiting hunting of older male elk resulted in an increased ratio of male:female elk.
