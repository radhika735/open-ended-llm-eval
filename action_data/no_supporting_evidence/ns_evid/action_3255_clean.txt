3255: Introduce nurse plants: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Nurse plants (also known as companion plants or pioneer plants) can be planted to help naturally recolonizing vegetation (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants may trap and stabilize sediments, trap propagules, reduce harsh environmental conditions (e.g. temperature fluctuations and strong sunlight), attract pollinators, deflect herbivory away from focal species, and/or limit weed establishment. Caution: Nurse plant species must be chosen carefully. Species that spread easily or are very strong competitors can cause more harm than good. For example, the non-native mangrove apple Sonneratia apetala has been used to restore Chinese mangroves, but has spread into neighbouring forests (Ren et al. 2009).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have reported the effects of the nurse plants on other vegetation, not just the survival or growth of the nurse plants. Studies must have explicitly planted vegetation for its nursing effect. Studies are summarized under other interventions if (a) the nurse plant is itself a desirable part of the final plant community, (b) if vegetation other than nurse plants is introduced, or (c) desirable vegetation is planted into existing nurse vegetation. Studies of the nursing effect of existing vegetation (e.g. Lewis & Dunstan 1975; McKee et al. 2007) are outside the scope of this synopsis.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on naturally colonizing vegetation, of introducing nurse plants to restore or create brackish/saline swamps. The study was in India.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE
 
VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that the average height of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses increased by 21–90% (depending on the species) over the first month after establishment.

OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that 60–80% (depending on the species) of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses developed into seedlings. Saltmarsh grasses trapped 1,200–1,372 mangrove propagules/m2/week, approximately 1–2 years after they were planted.
