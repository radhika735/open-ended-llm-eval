1442: Use nets to keep primates out of fruit trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Tree nets can be used to close off tree canopy travel pathways of primates in order to protect the fruit from being eaten by the primates. Netting is cheap to install but can be labour intensive for subsistence farmers.

Key Messages:

One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in IndonesiaÂ found that areas where nets were used to protect crop trees, crop-raiding by orangutans was reduced.
