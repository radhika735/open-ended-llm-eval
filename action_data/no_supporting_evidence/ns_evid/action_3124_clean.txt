3124: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Covers such as plastic sheeting, fabric sheeting, wood chips or straw mulch could be used to control problematic plants. These may act as direct physical barriers, temporarily covering the ground or water surface to prevent seeds from settling and establishing. Barriers could also be used to modify environmental conditions to the detriment of problematic species. Shading or opaque screens can limit photosynthesis. In areas where the sun is strong, black plastic placed on the soil/sediment surface can increase temperatures to kill problematic plants and their seeds (a technique known as solarization; Katan & DeVay 1991). Covers can be anchored underwater, if necessary.
Caution: Covers will also affect, and may kill, desirable plant species. Temporary application, when a site is most vulnerable to invasion by problematic plants, could solve this problem. Covers may need to be punctured to allow gas to escape.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Add surface mulch or Add cover other than mulch, primarily to benefit desirable plants rather than harm problematic plants; Add surface mulch to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using covers or barriers to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. The study was in Canada.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that covering plots with rubber sheeting after cutting back yellow iris Iris pseudacorus prevented most vegetation regrowth in an intermittently flooded marsh, but had no clear effect in a permanently flooded marsh.
