1908: Carnivores: Supplement meat-based diet with amino acids
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some amino acids cannot be made in the body and are therefore essential within the diet. For felids, taurine is an essential amino acid and a deficiency in taurine can cause diseases if not present in the diet.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USAÂ found that supplementing an animal-protein diet with taurine, increased plasma taurine levels in maned wolves.
