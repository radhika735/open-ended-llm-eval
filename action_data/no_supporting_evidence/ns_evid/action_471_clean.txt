471: Use lights low in spectral red to reduce mortality from artificial lights
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds are most sensitive to red light, meaning that if bulbs used at night emit less red light then they may prove less attractive to birds, whilst remaining equally visible to humans.
 

Key Messages:
Two studies from the North Sea and the Netherlands found that fewer birds were attracted to low-red lights (including green and blue lights), compared with the number expected, or the number attracted to white or red lights.
