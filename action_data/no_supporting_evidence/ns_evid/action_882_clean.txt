882: Use antifungal treatment to reduce chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Effective treatments for chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. Also, to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between breeding facilities, released or translocated between field sites.
 

Key Messages:

Twelve of 16 studies (including four randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Europe, Australia, Tasmania, Japan and the USA found that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis. Four studies found that treatments did not cure chytridiomycosis, but did reduce infection levels or had mixed results.
Six of the eight studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in Japan, Tasmania, the UK and USA testing treatment with itraconazole found that it was effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis. One study found that it reduced infection levels and one found mixed effects.
Six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians.
