2474: Clone rare species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cloning technology is advancing rapidly. For rare mammals, cloning provides the potential to increase reproductive output from a small number of individuals by using surrogate parents of closely related but non-threatened species.
Note that many relevant studies may be documented in journals that are not primarily conservation-related and which are, therefore, not included in our systematic searches for evidence.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of cloning rare species. This study was in Iran.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): A controlled study in Iran found that immature eggs of domestic sheep have potential to be used for cloning of Esfahan mouflon.
