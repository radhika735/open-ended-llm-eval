270: Reduce electrocutions by using plastic, not aluminium, leg rings to mark birds
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Leg rings, used to identify birds, could increase electrocution rates if made of metal. Therefore, plastic bands are sometimes recommended.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated and controlled study in the USA found no evidence for lower electrocution rates for raptors marked with plastic leg rings, compared to metal ones.
