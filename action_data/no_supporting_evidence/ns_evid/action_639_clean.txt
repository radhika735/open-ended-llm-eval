639: Provide supplementary food after release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding is a technique frequently used to support bird populations or increase reproductive success (see separate section). Newly released birds may be unable to find enough food when they are first released and therefore supplementary food may offer a way of ensuring they survive until they have learned to forage successfully.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies from found that malleefowl Leipoa ocellata, Andean condors Vultur gryphus and pink pigeons Nesoenas mayeri used supplementary food when it was provided after release.
A replicated, controlled study from Australia found that malleefowl had higher survival when supplied with supplementary food.
A study in Peru found that supplementary food could be used to increase the foraging range of condors after release, or to guide them back to suitable feeding areas.
