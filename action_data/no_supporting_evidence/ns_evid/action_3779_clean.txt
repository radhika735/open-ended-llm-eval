3779: Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release: Tuatara
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Head-starting is a specialized management technique that raises early-stage reptiles (eggs, hatchlings and/or juveniles) to later life stages (juvenile, sub-adult or adult) in captivity before releasing them into the wild. Rearing animals beyond their most vulnerable stages may increase the chance of survival following release, and as such improve the chances of reintroduction success.
Here we only include those studies where eggs or juveniles were collected from the wild; for those that were bred in captivity see Breed reptiles in captivity and Release captive-bred reptiles in to the wild. See also Release reptiles born/hatched in captivity from wild-collected eggs/wild-caught females without rearing.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group, though no studies were found for amphisbaenians. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles; Snakes & lizards or Crocodilians.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of head-starting wild-caught tuatara for release. Both studies were in New Zealand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One study in New Zealand reported that 67–70% of head-started tuatara survived over monitoring periods of 9–11 months. One study in New Zealand found that 56% of head-started tuatara were recaptured over six years following release.
Condition (1 studies): One study in New Zealand reported that head-started tuatara increased in weight by around 100 g during the five years following release.
