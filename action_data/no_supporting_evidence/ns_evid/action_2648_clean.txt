2648: Fell trees in groups, leaving surrounding forest unharvested
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
When timber harvesting or woodland management operations take place, trees may be clearfelled across a large area, thinned throughout the woodland or cut in patches, leaving surrounding forest unharvested. Felling in groups will produce a lower timber harvest than clearfelling but will leave more forest unaffected, which may help to sustain populations of some species. It will also affect less of the woodland area overall than does thinning of trees or selecting individual trees scattered throughout the forest to fell.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of felling trees in groups, leaving surrounding forest unharvested. Two studies were in Canada and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study and one site comparison study), in Canada, found that felling groups of trees within otherwise undisturbed stands increased the abundance of one of four small mammal species relative to clearcutting. The other study found that none of four small mammal species monitored showed abundance increases.
Survival (1 study): A study in the UK found that when trees were felled in large groups with surrounding forest unaffected, there was less damage to artificial hazel dormouse nests than when trees were felled in small groups or thinned throughout.
