439: Reduce nest ectoparasites by providing beneficial nesting material
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some birds incorporate sprigs of volatile-rich plants into their nests, possibly as a method of reducing parasite burdens. Adding similar material may therefore represent a low-cost method of reducing the impact of parasites on nestlings.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled experiment in Canada found lower numbers of some, but not all, parasites in nests provided with beneficial nesting material, but that there was no effect on fledging rates or chick condition.
