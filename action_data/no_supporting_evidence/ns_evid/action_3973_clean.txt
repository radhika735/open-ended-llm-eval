3973: Maintain upland heath/moorland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Increased management of upland heath, or moorland, in particular by overgrazing, has led to a reduction in characteristic vegetation cover in favour of more dominant grass species, which are less favoured by sheep (Martin et al. 2013). A reduction in grazing pressure, or a switch to low intensity cutting or burning regimes, may allow moorland vegetation to recover, and in turn potentially support larger populations of heathland butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of maintaining upland heath/moorland on butterflies and moths. All three studies were in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that lightly grazed or ungrazed upland acid grassland had a higher species richness of moths than commercially grazed grassland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Three controlled studies (including two replicated, randomized studies) in the UK found that ungrazed, lightly grazed or summer grazed upland grassland had a higher abundance of adult moths, moth caterpillars and all caterpillars than grassland grazed at commercial stocking densities or all year round.
