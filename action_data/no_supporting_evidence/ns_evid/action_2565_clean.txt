2565: Remove vegetation using herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Removal of vegetation may help to maintain habitats in an early-successional state. Herbicides may also be used to control some colonising plants species in favour of others that are more attractive as food plants. This may benefit mammal species that depend on such habitats.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing vegetation using herbicides. All six studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): Two controlled studies (one replicated) in the USA found that applying herbicide did not increase numbers of translocated Utah prairie dogs or alter mule deer densities in areas of tree clearance.
Survival (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that applying herbicide, along with mechanical disturbance and seeding, increased overwinter survival of mule deer fawns.
Condition (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that applying herbicide did not reduce bot fly infestation rates of rodents and cottontail rabbits.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that applying herbicide increased forest use by female, but not male, white-tailed deer and increased pasture use by cottontail rabbits in some, but not all, sampling seasons.
