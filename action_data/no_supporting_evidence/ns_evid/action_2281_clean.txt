2281: Provide educational or other training programmes about the marine environment to improve behaviours towards marine invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Whether through school curricula, education programmes, training courses, workshops, or outreach events, providing education and training programmes can help raise awareness about marine conservation issues and potentially induce a behavioural change (Colleton et al. 2016; Kwan et al. 2017; Leisher et al. 2012). These programmes may be about the marine environment in general or about specific ecosystems, species, or groups of species, their biodiversity, conservation, and management.
Evidence for related interventioms is summarised under “Education and awareness – Organise educational marine wildlife tours to improve behaviours towards marine invertebrates”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of providing educational or other training programmes about the marine environment on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. The study took place in Hong Kong.

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after survey study in Hong Kong found that a conservation education programme on the Asian horseshoe crab in secondary schools significantly increased the students’ behaviour towards Asian horseshoe crab conservation.
