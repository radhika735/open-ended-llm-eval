1871: Amphibians: Provide artificial aquifers for species which breed in upwelling springs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some amphibian species appear to breed underground in places where water flows up through rock fragments to form springs (aquifers). In captivity, artificial systems can be designed to replicate these upflows and may improve breeding success for cave-dwelling species.   

Key Messages:

One small study in the USA found that salamanders bred in an aquarium fitted with an artificial aquifer.
