587: Alter habitat to encourage birds to leave an area
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many ground-nesting seabirds require little or no vegetation to be able to nest. Therefore, if conservationists are trying to move a colony, for a number of reasons, they can make the habitat at the old site unsuitable by encouraging vegetation to grow there.
Many species of seabird disperse from colonies outside the breeding season, allowing work to be carried out without disturbing birds.
 

Key Messages:
A single before-and-after study in the USA found that an entire Caspian tern Sterna caspia population moved following (amongst other interventions) the alteration of nesting habitat at the old colony site.
