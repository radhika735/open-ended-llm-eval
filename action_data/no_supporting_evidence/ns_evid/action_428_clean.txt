428: Reduce inter-specific competition for food by removing or controlling competitor species
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
If food resources are limiting then competition with other species can limit reproduction or survival. Conservationists can either provide supplementary food (see ‘General responses to small/declining populations’) or control competitor species (discussed below).
 

Key Messages:

Two controlled before-and-after studies from the UK found that six species of wildfowl showed significant increases following the removal of fish from lakes. Three other species did not show increases.
A study from France found that grey partridges Perdix perdix increased at a site with several interventions, including the control of competitor species.
A before-and-after study from Spain found no change in the rate of kleptoparasitic attacks on herons after the culling of gulls at a colony.
