1927: Carnivores: Provide devices to simulate live prey, including sounds, lures, pulleys and bungees
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Providing food that simulates wild prey aims to encourage natural feeding behaviours and reduce stereotypical behaviours as it mimics wild situations.

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in the USA and the UK found that activity levels and behavioural diversity increased in felids when presented with a lure or pulley system.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that pacing behaviour decreased and walking increased in cougars, but pacing initially increased in tigers, when provided with a carcass on a bungee.
