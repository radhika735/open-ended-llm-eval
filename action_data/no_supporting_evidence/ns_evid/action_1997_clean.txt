1997: Create or maintain small dams to provide foraging and drinking habitat for bats
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Large dams are likely to have a negative impact on bats due to habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. Rebelo & Rainho 2009). However, small dams along rivers can create pools and reservoirs within natural habitats, which may provide foraging and drinking resources for bats. For interventions that involve creating other types of water sources, see ‘Create artificial water sources’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of maintaining small dams as foraging and drinking habitat for bats on bat populations. The study was in Portugal.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Portugal found that reservoirs created using small dams had greater activity (relative abundance) of four bat species than the streams feeding into them.
