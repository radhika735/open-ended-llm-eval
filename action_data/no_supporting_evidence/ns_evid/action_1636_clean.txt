1636: Cut trees and apply herbicide
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some tree species can survive cutting by resprouting. Cutting combined with application of herbicide aims to kill trees that might otherwise resprout after cutting.

Key Messages:

One controlled study in the UK found that cutting trees and applying herbicide increased the abundance of heather seedlings. However, one replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting silver birch trees and applying herbicide did not alter cover of common heather when compared to cutting alone.
Two controlled studies (one of which was a before-and-after study) in South Africa  found that cutting of trees and applying herbicide did not increase shrub cover.
Two controlled studies in South Africa found that cutting trees and applying herbicide increased the total number of plant species and plant diversity.
One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced cover of silver birch trees.
