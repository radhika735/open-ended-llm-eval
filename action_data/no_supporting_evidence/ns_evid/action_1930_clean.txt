1930: Exclude bats from roosts during building work
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves excluding bats from roosts within buildings during building work. Although this may prevent injury or death as a direct result of the building work itself, it is important to consider both the short-term and long-term impacts of exclusion on the survival and productivity of bat populations.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of excluding bats from roosts during building work on bat populations. The study was in the UK.
