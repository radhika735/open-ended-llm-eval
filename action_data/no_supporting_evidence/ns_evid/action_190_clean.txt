190: Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields for birds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention allows vegetation in field margins to regenerate naturally, without planting, although it can involve subsequent mowing. The margins are not fertilised and only spot-treated with herbicides if necessary.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that three sparrow species found on uncultivated margins were not found on mown field edges. A replicated study from Canada found fewer species in uncultivated margins than in hedges or in trees planted as windbreaks.
Three replicated studies from the USA and UK, one controlled, found that some birds were associated with uncultivated margins, or that birds were more abundant on margins than on other habitats. One study found that these effects were very weak. Four replicated studies (two of the same experiment) from the UK, two controlled, found that uncultivated margins contained similar numbers of birds in winter, or that several species studied did not show associations with margins.
A replicated, controlled study from the UK found that yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella used uncultivated margins more than crops in early summer, but use fell in uncut margins in late summer. Cut margins however, were used more than other habitat types late in summer.
A replicated study from the UK found high rates of survival for grey partridge Perdix perdix released in margins.
