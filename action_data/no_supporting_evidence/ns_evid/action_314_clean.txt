314: Start educational programmes for personal watercraft owners
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
It is possible that people will respond more positively to access restrictions or signs warning them of disturbing birds if they are more aware of the issue. Educational programmes may be able to help with this, informing the public of why certain actions are being taken. More general education programmes are discussed in ‘Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce pressures on species’.
 
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after trial in the USA found that rates of disturbance by personal watercraft decreased and reproductive success of common terns Sterna hirundo increased following a series of educational programmes aimed at recreational boat users.
