3411: Use slot/strip seeding
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Slot or strip seeding involves drilling of seeds into shallow slots using specialized machinery. This potentially aids germination of grassland seeds by reducing seed removal by seed predators as well as allowing for lower application rates of seeds.

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of using slot/strip seeding on grassland vegetation. Both studies were in the UK.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Grass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased grass species richness.
Forb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that strip seeding increased forb species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)

Sown/planted species abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that in the majority of cases strip seeding resulted in failed introductions of sown species.
