162: Raise awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves general information and awareness campaigns in response to a range of threats. Studies describing educational campaigns in response to specific threats are described in the chapter on that threat category (e.g. ‘Threat: Biological Resource Use - Use education programmes and local engagement to help reduce persecution or exploitation of species’).

Key Messages:
A review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement.
