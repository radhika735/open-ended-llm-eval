1711: Strip/disturb topsoil (alongside planting/seeding)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Stripping topsoil can remove vegetation as well as any seeds present in the soil, thereby reducing the abundance unwanted plant species and reducing the potential for their regeneration. Combining this with planting and sowing seed may help to increase the survival and growth of introduced plants.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies in the UK found that removal of topsoil and addition seed/clippings increased cover of heathland plants or cover of heather and gorse. One controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance using a rotovator and spreading clippings of heathland plants (alongside mowing) increased the number of heathland plants.
One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that stripping the surface layers of soil and adding seed reduced the cover of perennial rye-grass. One randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removal of topsoil and addition of the clippings of heathland plants did not alter the cover of annual grasses but led to a decrease in cover of perennial grasses.
