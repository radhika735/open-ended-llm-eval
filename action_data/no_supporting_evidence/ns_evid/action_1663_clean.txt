1663: Reduce numbers of large herbivores
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
High densities of large herbivores such as deer or non-native feral livestock have been shown to reduce species diversity and limit the regeneration of shrublands in some parts of the world (Perea et al. 2014). Reducing the number of large herbivores in shrubland areas may allow vegetation to increase in height and cover.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after trial in the USA found that removing feral sheep, cattle and horses increased shrub cover and reduced grass cover. One replicated study in the UK found that reducing grazing pressure by red deer increased the cover and height of common heather.
