947: Retain existing bat roosts and access points within developments
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many bat species are known to roost in the crevices and roof voids of buildings. Existing roosts and their access points may be conserved during residential or commercial developments, for example by retaining a roof space used as a roost during renovations.
For interventions that involve creating new bat roosts or relocating access points within developments, see ‘Create alternative bat roosts within developments’ and ‘Relocate access points to bat roosts within developments’.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of retaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments on bat populations. Two studies were in the UK and one was in Ireland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): One before-and-after study in Ireland found similar numbers of brown long-eared bats roosting within an attic after existing access points were retained during renovations. One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that four of nine bat roosts retained within developments were used as maternity colonies, in two cases by similar or greater numbers of bats after development had taken place. One review in the UK found that bats used two-thirds of retained and modified bat roosts after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created roosts.
