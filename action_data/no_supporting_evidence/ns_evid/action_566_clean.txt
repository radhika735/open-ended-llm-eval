566: Translocate individuals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Translocations, also known as relocations, reintroductions, restocking, or repatriations, involve the intentional release of captive-bred and/or wild-caught birds into the wild in order to re-establish a population that has been lost, or augment a critically small population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, or simply increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations are also frequently used to move birds to areas that have been cleared of invasive predators, particularly on islands. This intervention is not the same as that of periodically moving next boxes to prevent predators from learning their locations, discussed in ‘Invasive and other problematic species’.
Translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
 

Key Messages:
A review of 239 bird translocation programmes found 63–67% resulted in establishment of self-sustaining populations.
