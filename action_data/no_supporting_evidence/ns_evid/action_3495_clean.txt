3495: Regulate temperature of water discharged from power plants
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Warm water discharged from power plants into the ocean can change ocean temperatures and as a result affect local habitat use by marine reptiles, such as sea turtles, which may seek out areas of specific temperatures (Madrak et al. 2016). Regulating the temperature of water discharged would also protect against any negative impacts of power plant closure, which can cause rapid changes in local ocean temperatures.
