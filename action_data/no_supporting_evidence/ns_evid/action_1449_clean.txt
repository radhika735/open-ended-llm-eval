1449: Humans chase primates using random loud noise
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Farmers chase primate crop-raiding species out of fields by shouting and banging objects to make loud noises. Farmers may use a range of noise-makers, such as beating drums and tins, bells, fire crackers, and ‘cracking’ whips in addition to yelling and whistling.

Key Messages:

One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that in areas where noise deterrents were used, along with tree nets, crop raiding by orangutans was reduced.
One study in the Democratic Republic Congo found that chasing gorillas and using random noise resulted in the return of gorillas from plantations to areas close to protected forest.
