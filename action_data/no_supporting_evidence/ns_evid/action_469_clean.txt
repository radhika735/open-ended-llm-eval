469: Shield lights to reduce mortality from artificial lights
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Lights that are not designed to be seen as warnings can be shielded, so that the light from them is directed down (or in the required direction). This can reduce the light projected into the sky and therefore the visibility and attractiveness of the lights to birds.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that fewer Newell’s shearwaters Puffinus newelli were found grounded when security lights were shielded, compared to nights when they were not.
