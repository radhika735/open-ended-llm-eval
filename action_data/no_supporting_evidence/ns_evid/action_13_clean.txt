13: Create patches of bare ground for ground-nesting bees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
One replicated controlled trial in Germany and four small trials (three replicated, one not) have shown that artificially exposed areas of bare soil can be successfully colonised by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps in the first or second year. We have captured no evidence for the effect of creating areas of bare ground on bee populations or communities on a larger scale.
