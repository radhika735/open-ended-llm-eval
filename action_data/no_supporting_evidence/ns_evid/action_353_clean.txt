353: Fertilize artificial grasslands 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fertilised grasslands are likely to have higher productivity and therefore support larger numbers of birds, particularly grazing species, such as geese. This intervention is commonly used to attract geese to specific areas to reduce conflict with farmers, when geese graze their crops. See ‘Provide sacrificial grasslands to reduce the impact of wild geese on crops’.
 

Key Messages:

We captured four studies examining the impacts of fertilizing grasslands, all from the UK and investigating grazing by geese Anser and Branta spp. Two studies found that more geese grazed on areas that were fertilised compared with control areas. Two studies found that cut and fertilised areas were used more than control areas. One study found that fertilised areas were used less than re-seeded grasslands.
One study found that fertilisation affected grazing at applications of 50 kg N/ha, but not 18 kg N/ha. One study found that grazing rates only increased with applications of up to 80 kg.N/ha.
