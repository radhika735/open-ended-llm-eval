2517: Translocate mammals away from sites of proposed energy developments
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may be vulnerable to habitat destruction at sites of developments such as energy generation installations or mines. If permission is granted for such developments to go ahead, translocating mammals away from the site may be a way of attempting to mitigate the effects of the development.
For related studies, see interventions within Species Management- Translocate Mammals.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals away from sites of proposed energy developments. One study was in Brazil and one was in Australia.
