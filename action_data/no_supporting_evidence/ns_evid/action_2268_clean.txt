2268: Transplant/release captive-bred or hatchery-reared species in predator exclusion cages
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, such as habitat loss and overharvest (Airoldi et al. 2008; Hobday et al. 2000). To counteract this phenomenon, captive-bred or hatchery-reared marine subtidal benthic invertebrates can be transplanted or released at a site, either to introduce a species to a new site (where they did not historically occur), to reintroduce a species to a site (where they used to occur), or to enhance the population at a site where the species is already present by increasing its abundance (Hansen & Gosselin 2013). Following transplantation or release, initial mortality can be high, for instance due to stress and predation. To potentially increase survival, animals can be transplanted/released in exclusion cages to reduce the initial predation while animals are acclimating to their new environment (Hansen & Gosselin 2013).
When species transplantation/release was undertaken without predator exclusion cage, evidence has been summarised under “Species management – Transplant/release captive-bred or hatchery-reared species”. Evidence for other related intervention is summarised under “Species management – Translocate species” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Translocate biogenic or habitat-forming (biogenic) species”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of transplanting or releasing hatchery-reared species in predator exclusion cages on their wild populations. The study was in the North Pacific Ocean (Canada).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, controlled study the North Pacific Ocean found that hatchery-reared abalone transplanted in predator exclusion cages had similar survivorship following release compared to those transplanted directly onto the seabed.
