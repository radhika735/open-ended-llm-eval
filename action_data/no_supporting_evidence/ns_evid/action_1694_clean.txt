Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding mulch may help to retain moisture in soil at shrublands in arid sites, as well as reducing the germination of problematic/invasive species. Adding fertilizer may help to stimulate the growth of any shrubland plants already present.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled study in the USAÂ found that adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase the seedling abundance of seven shrub species. The same study also reported no change in grass cover.
