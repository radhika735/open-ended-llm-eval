499: Clean nest boxes to increase occupancy or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Old nest boxes may contain parasites and so reduce breeding success in them, or they may provide a suitable base for building new nests. Cleaning them out may, therefore, have a positive or a negative impact on nest site choice and reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:

Five studies from Spain and North America found that various songbirds preferentially nested in cleaned nest boxes, compared to used ones. One study from the USA found that eastern bluebirds showed this preference, but most did not switch from a soiled to a cleaned nest box. One study from the USA found that birds showed an avoidance of heavily-soiled boxes and one from Canada found that tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor preferentially selected nests which were sterilised by microwaving.
Two studies from the USA found that eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis and house wrens Troglodytes aedon preferentially nested in uncleaned nest boxes, and one study found that prothonotary warblers Protonotaria citrea showed no preference for cleaned or uncleaned boxes. 
None of the five studies that investigated it found any difference in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned nest boxes.
