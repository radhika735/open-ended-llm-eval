Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Soil microbial biomass is the amount of tiny living organisms within a given area or amount of soil. Functional diversity is the value and range of functional roles (or ‘traits’) that organisms play in a given ecosystem (Tilman 2001), in this case the agro-ecosystem. Highly diverse and active soil organisms indicate good soil health.

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: Two site comparison studies from Italy and Pakistan (one also replicated) found a higher diversity of soil invertebrates and microorganisms in low-input systems.
Nutrient loss: One study from Canada found lower nutrient levels and yields in low-input systems.
 
SOIL TYPES COVERED: coarse sandy, loam, sandy-loam, and silt.
