256: Deter birds from landing on shellfish culture gear using spikes on oyster cages
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Oyster bags are mesh bags, attached to floats and anchored on the seabed into which young ‘seed’ oysters are placed. They then grow and are harvested when large enough. Oyster cages are similar, but are made of rigid wire mesh.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated and controlled study from Canada found that significantly fewer birds landed on oyster cages with spikes attached, compared to control cages.
