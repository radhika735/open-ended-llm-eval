1608: Change type of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Changing the type of livestock that graze in shrublands may help to reduce grazing pressure on particular plant species that were previously damaged by overgrazing, thereby allowing recovery of populations of these plants. Changes in the type of livestock may also lead to changes in the structure of the community, such as the height of plants.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after studies and one controlled study in Spain and the UK found changing the type of livestock led to mixed effects on shrub cover. However, in two of these studies changing the type of livestock reduced the cover of herbaceous species.
One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that grazing with both cattle and sheep, as opposed to grazing with sheep, reduced cover of purple moor grass, but had no effect on four other plant species.
