608: Artificially incubate and hand-rear rails in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial incubation involves removing eggs from incubating parents and using an incubator to hatch them. Techniques can be extremely complex, with precision humidity and temperature control and turning of the eggs to ensure correct development Hand-rearing can be used with chicks from artificially-incubated eggs or with chicks removed from parents after hatching and involves manually feeding chicks until independence. Both techniques can be used to encourage parents to produce more offspring, or when naturally-raised chicks and eggs have low survival.
 

Key Messages:
A controlled before-and-after study from New Zealand found that post-release survival of hand-reared takahe Porphyrio hochstetteri (formerly P. mantelli) was as high as wild-reared birds and that six of ten released females raised chicks.
