2482: Remove understorey vegetation in forest
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through fire suppression, some forest areas have developed denser understorey vegetation than was the case under natural fire regimes. To reduce fuel loads and associated wildfire risk, understorey vegetation may be removed. Prescribed burning is one option for doing this, but the rapid habitat change that this causes, together with potential loss of food resources and shelter, could negatively impact forest floor mammals. This intervention, therefore, considers specifically manual or mechanical removal of understorey vegetation as an alternative to prescribed burning, and how this affects forest mammals.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing understorey vegetation in forest. All three studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (two also before-and-after), in the USA, found that compared to prescribed burning, mechanically removing understorey vegetation growth in forests did not increase abundances of white-footed mice, shrewsÂ or four rodent species.
