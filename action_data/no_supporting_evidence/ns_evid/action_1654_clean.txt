1654: Cut and apply herbicide to control bracken
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Combining cutting and application of herbicide to control bracken may help to reduce the cover of bracken, therefore helping shrubland species to become established or increase in cover.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that cutting and applying herbicide to control bracken did not alter heather biomass. One randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide increased heather cover. One randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the UK found that cutting and using herbicide had no significant effect on the cover of seven plant species.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting.
Three randomized, controlled studies (one also a before-and-after trial, and one of which was a paired study) in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover.
