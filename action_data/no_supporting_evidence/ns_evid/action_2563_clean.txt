2563: Increase size of protected area
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Large protected areas may be better able to support viable populations of mammals than are smaller areas. However, protected area effectiveness may also be linked to sites being surrounded by similar habitat, having strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities and sufficient financial resources (Struhsaker et al. 2005). Where these are not in place, factors such as activities of surrounding human populations may have a greater impact on species survival (Parks & Harcourt 2002).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of increasing the size of a protected area. This study was in South Africa.

Behaviour change (1 study): A before-and-after study in South Africa found that expanding a fenced reserve resulted in the home range of a reintroduced group of lions becoming larger but the core range becoming smaller.
