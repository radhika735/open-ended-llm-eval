2546: Install pole crossings for gliders/flying squirrels
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife crossings over or under roads may be installed to reduce the impact of the road on animal mortality and on habitat fragmentation. They usually take the form of tunnels or bridges of a range of designs. These may not be suitable for use by mammals that move by gliding from tree to tree. Glide poles have been trialled, especially in Australia (e.g. Ball & Goldingay 2008), to provide a means of reconnecting habitat and reducing road mortality for gliding mammal species. Monitoring typically takes the form of documenting use of poles rather than looking at population level effects or impacts on road mortality.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on gliders/flying squirrels of installing pole crossings. Six studies were in Australia and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A study in Australia found that arboreal marsupials using artificial road crossing structures did not suffer high predation rates when doing so.

BEHAVIOUR (6 STUDIES)

Use (6 studies): Six studies (five replicated), in Australia and the USA, found that poles were used for crossing roads by squirrel gliders, sugar gliders and Carolina northern flying squirrels.
