1215: Use partial retention harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Alternatives to traditional clearcut harvesting have been examined due to a recognized need to protect forests. Partial retention harvesting, i.e. retention of mature trees at harvest, has become commonly employed to maintain stand structural diversity and therefore sustain biodiversity.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Canada found that using partial retention harvesting instead of clearcutting decreased the density of young trees.
