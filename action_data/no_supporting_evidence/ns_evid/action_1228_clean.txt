1228: Mechanically/manually remove invasive plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Invasions by non-native species are considered a major threat to biodiversity.  One way of controlling invasive plants is by selective mechanical removal. This action may also indirectly affect the abundance of plants other than the targeted species, and can as result influence the forest structure and composition.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity.
One replicated, controlled study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height.
One replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species.
