324: Use fire suppression/control
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some environments, fires can damage important habitats, particularly if habitat patches are small or fragmented, meaning that entire patches can be destroyed in fires. Under these circumstances it may be beneficial to reduce fire frequency or severity, but there may be long time issues due to the build-up of fuel (i.e. dead vegetation).
 

Key Messages:

Two out of three before-and-after studies, from Australia and the UK, found that five species of bird (including noisy scrub-bird, the target species of one study) increased following fire suppression measures.
A before-and-after study in the USA found that open habitat species declined in a pine forest site after fire exclusion, whilst mesic woodland species appeared. A before-and-after study from the UK found that five bird species declined following fire suppression.
