424: Reduce inter-specific competition for nest sites of songbirds by removing competitor species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
As humans modify ever-increasing amounts of habitat across the world, the number of nesting sites for many species is becoming limited, potentially increasing competition and reducing reproductive output. Two potential solutions are to increase the number of nesting sites (see separate section in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’) or to reduce competition by removing or controlling competitor species (see below).
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from Australia found increases in bird populations and species richness after the control of noisy miners Manorina melanocephala – a native but hyper-competitive species.
A controlled study from Italy found that blue tits Parus caeruleus nested in more nest boxes when hazel dormice Muscardinus avellanarius were excluded from nest boxes over winter.
