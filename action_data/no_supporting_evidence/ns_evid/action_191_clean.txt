191: Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields for birds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves planting field margins with a grass-rich seed mixture. It includes ‘floristically-enhanced' grass margins available under the English Higher Level Stewardship scheme. The margins are not fertilised and only spot-treated with herbicides if necessary.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated controlled study from the USA found that there were more species in fields bordered by margins than unbordered fields. Two replicated studies from the UK, one with paired sites, found no effect of field margins on species richness. A replicated, controlled study from the UK found that more birds and more species used sown strips in fields than the fields themselves, but even more used field margins.
Nine studies from the UK and USA, seven replicated, two controlled, found more positive population trends, higher populations or strong habitat associations for some or all species for sites with grass margins to fields. One study investigated multiple interventions. Three replicated studies from the UK found that grass field margins did not have a positive effect on populations of some or all bird species investigated.
Both studies that examined habitat use (one replicated, both from the UK) found that species used margins more than other habitats. A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that birds used cut margins more than uncut margins during winter but less than other management regimes during summer. The authors argue that management type is more important than the seed mix used to sow the margins.
A replicated study from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix had smaller broods in grass margins than other habitat types.
