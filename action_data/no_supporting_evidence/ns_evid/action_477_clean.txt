477: Remove eggs from wild nests to increase reproductive output 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If a bird population is at a very low level then removing eggs from nests can be used to encourage females to continue laying, with some species replacing eggs as they are removed. The removed eggs can then be hand-reared (see ‘Artificially incubate and hand-rear birds in captivity’) or fostered (‘Foster eggs or chicks with wild conspecifics’ and ‘Foster eggs or chicks with non-conspecifics’), increasing the productivity of the species.
Alternatively, removing eggs from wild nests may actually increase the success of these nests, possibly due to competition between siblings. Studies discussing this aspect of the intervention are described below.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study from Mauritius found that harvesting entire clutches appeared to increase Mauritius kestrels Falco punctatus productivity more effectively than removing individual eggs as they were laid.
A replicated study over 30 years in Canada (Kuyt 1996) found that wild whooping cranes Grus americana reproductive success was higher for nests with one or two eggs removed than for control nests.
A single study from the USA found that removing bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus eggs from wild nests for hand-rearing did not appear to greatly affect the wild population.
