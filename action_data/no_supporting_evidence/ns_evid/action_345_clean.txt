345: Remove coarse woody debris from forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Removal of coarse woody debris (i.e. dead woody plant material &gt;5mm diameter, including bark &gt; 5mm thickness) from forests is a practice most commonly undertaken in North American and Australian forests to reduce risk of intense wildfires by reducing the fuel-load. It may be undertaken as a deliberate conservation intervention to benefit certain bird species, but with the potential to adversely affect understorey species that utilise accumulated dead wood for foraging or nesting.
 

Key Messages:

One of two replicated and controlled studies from the USA found that overall breeding bird abundance and diversity were lower in plots where woody debris was removed, compared to control plots. Several individually-analysed species showed lower abundances. A replicated, controlled before-and-after study from the USA found lower nest survival for black-chinned hummingbirds following debris removal. 
Some species in both studies increased after debris removal.
