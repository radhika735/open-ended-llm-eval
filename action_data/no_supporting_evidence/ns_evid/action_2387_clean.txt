2387: Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Agri-environment schemes are government or inter-governmental schemes designed to compensate farmers financially for changing agricultural practice to be more favourable to biodiversity and the landscape. Agri-environment schemes represent many different specific interventions relevant to conservation. Where a study can be clearly assigned to a specific intervention, it appears in the appropriate section (e.g. Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields and Establish wild flower areas on farmland). This section includes broader evidence about the success of agri-environment policies, such as where specific actions are not clearly defined.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of paying farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures. The three studies were in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): A replicated, controlled study, in the UK found that agri-environment scheme enrolment was associated with increased brown hare density in one of two regions studied. A replicated, site comparison study in Northern Ireland, UK found that agri-environment scheme enrolment did not increase numbers of Irish hares. A replicated, controlled study in the UK found that in field margins created through enrolment in an agri-environment scheme, small mammal abundance in spring increased, whereas it remained stable in conventionally managed margins.
