1936: Engage farmers and landowners to manage land for bats
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Only 14.7% of the world’s land surface is currently protected (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN 2016). Therefore, it is vital to engage effectively with landowners, such as farmers, so that they manage their land in ways that help to maintain bat populations. This may be done by providing advice and support to farmers on how to manage their land specifically for bats.
For an intervention that uses financial incentives to encourage environmentally friendly farming practices that may benefit bats, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’. For an intervention that involves providing education, see ‘Educate farmers, land managers and local communities about the benefits of bats to improve management of bat habitats’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of engaging farmers and landowners to manage land for bats on bat populations. The study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One study in the UK found that during a five-year project to engage farmers and landowners to manage land for bats, the overall population of greater horseshoe bats at four maternity roosts in the area increased (but see summary below).

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Change in human behaviour (1 study): One study in the UK found that a landowner engagement project resulted in 77 bat-related management agreements covering approximately 6,536 ha of land.
