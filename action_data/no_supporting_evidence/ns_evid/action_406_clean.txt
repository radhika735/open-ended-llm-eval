406: Use snakeskin to deter mammalian nest predators
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some bird species such as great crested flycatchers Myiarchus crinitus and tufted titmice Baeolophus bicolor use snake skins in their nests, possibly to reduce predation.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled trial in the USA found that artificial nests were less likely to be predated if they had snake skin wrapped around them than control nests.
