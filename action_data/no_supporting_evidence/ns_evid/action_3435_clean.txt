3435: Create natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Definition: ‘Natural rocky reef topography’ refers to the full fingerprint of substrate topography found in natural rocky habitats. 
Topography influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms on intertidal rocky substrates. Variation in topography generates variation in the physical environment and plays an important role in sustaining biodiversity and ecological functioning (Levin 1974). On rocky reefs, many habitat features that offer refuge from physical stressors and predation, such as bumps, crevices and holes, are generated as a function of substrate topography and geomorphology. The full fingerprint of natural rocky reef topography encompasses a variety of habitat features of different scales interacting within a mosaic.
Marine artificial structures often have much lower topographic variability than natural rocky reefs, which is thought to be a key reason for their reduced biodiversity (Firth et al. 2013; Moschella et al. 2005). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on intertidal artificial structures by moulding or casting material during construction or retrospectively (see Evans et al. 2021).

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. One study was on an open coastline and in estuaries in the UK, and one was on an open coastline in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures did not increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness on structure surfaces.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Invertebrate abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that creating natural rocky reef topography on intertidal artificial structures had mixed effects on barnacle and mobile invertebrate abundances on structure surfaces, depending on the site.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One study in the UK reported that natural topography created on intertidal artificial structures was colonized by macroalgae and limpets, and that limpets used shaded grooves and water-retaining depressions created by the topography.
