180: Manage ditches to benefit wildlife
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Managing ditches to benefit wildlife can involve reduced or delayed cutting of vegetation on ditch banks and restricted fertiliser, herbicide or pesticide use on ditch banks or in fields adjoining ditches. ‘Bunded’ ditches are blocked to allow them to fill with water.

Key Messages:

Three out of four replicated studies from the UK found that some farmland birds responded positively to the presence of ditches managed for wildlife. All three also found that some species did not respond positively or responded negatively to management.
A replicated, controlled and paired sites study from the UK found that bunded ditches were visited by more birds than non-bunded ditches.
