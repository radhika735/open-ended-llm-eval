1313: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use a combination of control measures
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Because of the difficulty of controlling C. helmsii, a combination of control methods may be required to fully eradicate the species from a site (Dawson & Warman 1987, Leach & Dawson 2000, EPPO 2014). These could include a combination of mechanical removal, covering with lightproof barriers, and the use of herbicide. For example an integrated approach of mechanical removal (turf-stripping) and herbicide was used at a site in the UK, leading to an initial reduction in C. helmsii, although the species recolonized when treatment stopped and no quantitative data were provided (Clarke 2009).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study at a single pond in the UK found covering Crassula helmsii with carpet, followed by treatment with the herbicide glyphosate, killed 80% of the plant.
