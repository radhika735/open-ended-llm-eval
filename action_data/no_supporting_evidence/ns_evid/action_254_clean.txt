254: Use in-water devices to reduce fish loss from ponds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cormorants Phalacrocorax spp. hunt by pursuing fish underwater. Putting nets or other obstacles underwater may reduce hunting effectiveness and so reduce aquaculture losses.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from the USA found a 95% reduction in the number of double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus at two ponds in a fish farm following the installation of underwater ropes.
A replicated study at a fish farm in Australia found that hanging gill nets in ponds did not decrease the number of cormorants swimming in ponds.
