1335: Primates: Provide fresh produce
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Different species of primates show considerable variation in their natural diets. For example marmosets will eat gum as well as fruit, flowers, insects and other small animals and Macaques will eat both plants and meat. It is important that the diet of primates in captivity should be designed to reflect the appropriate natural diet, using fresh produce, of the species, giving them the opportunity to search and manipulate their food as they would in the wild.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that when fresh produce was offered instead of pellet feed more time was spent feeding and less time inactive in rhesus macaques.
