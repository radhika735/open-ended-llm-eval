1027: Establish fallowing to reduce pollution
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Husbandry practice on salmon farms is important in reducing the spread of disease within and beyond the farm. Fallowing has been practiced in terrestrial agriculture for centuries to reduce the incidence of disease. Many salmon farms use fallowing as a technique for disease control and some to reduce the build-up of sediments below cages. Chemical and biological remediation of benthos near salmon farms has been proven. A two month fallowing cycle is mandatory to break parasite cycles on salmon farms.

Key Messages:
A trial in Tasmania found sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages became more similar to non- impacted sites over two fallowing cycles.
