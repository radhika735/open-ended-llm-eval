2614: Use road lighting to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions was found to be six times higher at night and dawn than during the day (Lavsund & Sandegren 1991). Installing lighting along roads may increase visibility of animals to motorists and may, therefore, reduce the number of collisions. However, in areas where species are sensitive to human disturbance, they may avoid areas of roads with artificial lighting and, instead, cross elsewhere.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using road lighting to reduce vehicle collisions with mammals. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One of two studies (one controlled and one before-and-after), in the USA, found that road lighting reduced vehicle collisions with moose. The other study found that road lighting did not reduce vehicle collisions with mule deer.
