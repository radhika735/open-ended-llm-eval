519: Foster eggs or chicks of cranes with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering) 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There two species of cranes Grus spp. are resident in North America: the endangered whooping crane G. americana which migrates from central Canada to the southern USA; and the sandhill crane G. canadensis which contains several subspecies, some of which are migratory and some sedentary. Sandhill cranes offer the potential to foster whooping cranes, but there is uncertainty over the ability of whooping cranes to migrate successfully following if they are raised by another species.
 

Key Messages:
Two studies from the USA found low fledging success for cranes fostered to non-conspecifics’ nests.
