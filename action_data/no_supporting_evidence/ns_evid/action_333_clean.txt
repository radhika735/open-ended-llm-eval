333: Use shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood cutting is a management technique designed to avoid clear-cutting, but to provide even-aged timber. It involves cutting trees in a series of cuttings, allowing new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the USA found that community composition of birds in shelterwood stands differed from other forestry practices, with some species more abundant and others less so.
