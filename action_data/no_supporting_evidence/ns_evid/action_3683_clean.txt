3683: Use collar-mounted devices to reduce predation by domestic animals
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Domestic animals can predate a range of wild animals, with domestic cats Felis catus a potentially significant predator (Woods et al. 2003; Cecchetti et al. 2020). Various measures have been suggested, or are used, to try to reduce this predation, including a range of deterrents or warnings attached to collars that are worn by cats.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using collar-mounted devices to reduce predation by domestic animals on reptile populations. Both studies were in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized studies (including one before-and-after and one controlled study) in Australia found that cats wearing collar mounted neoprene bibs, with or without a bell, caught a similar number of combined reptiles and amphibians compared to cats not wearing them. The other study found that cats wearing collar mounted ruffs brought home fewer combined reptiles and amphibians than cats not wearing them.
