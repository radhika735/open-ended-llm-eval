1237: Remove burned trees 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In many cases after wildfire, burned trees are removed. The main reasons are that they may provide good wood fuel that increases the intensity of future wildfires. Removing the burned trees is often done by heavy machinery which compresses the soil and may affect the germination and regrowth of plants. Removing the dead organic matter may affect soil mineral content and plant composition. Removing burned trees may also influence the spatial pattern of germination and seedling establishment and change the forest structure and composition.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in Israel1 found that removing burned trees increased total plant species richness. One replicated, controlled study in Spain2 found that removal increased the cover and species richness of some plant species.
