1288: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use salt water to kill plants
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The tolerance of freshwater plant species, such as C. helmsii, to salt water is variable, but at high salinities it is likely to have adverse effects. However, these effects are likely to extend to native co-occurring plants.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials in the UK found that seawater eradicated Crassula helmsii.
