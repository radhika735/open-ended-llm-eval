635: Release birds in ‘coveys’
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coveys are ‘family groups’ of birds (normally gamebirds): broods of chicks with an accompanying adult. Groups of birds may be safer from predators than individual chicks and the presence of parents or foster parents may also help survival.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in Saudi Arabia found that houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii survival was low when chicks were released in coveys with flightless females.
A review of cackling goose  Branta hutchinsii conservation and a replicated study in England found that geese and grey partridge Perdix perdix releases were more  successful for birds released in coveys than for young birds released on their own or adults released in pairs.
