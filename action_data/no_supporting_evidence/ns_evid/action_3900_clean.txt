3900: Stop using pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspace 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Plants growing within urban landscapes, such as in flower beds and greenspaces, could provide important habitat for wildlife, including butterflies and moths. However, these areas are often subject to intense management, including regular doses of pesticides which can kill butterflies and moths. Managing public areas without the use of pesticides may help to support butterfly and moth populations in urban areas.
For other management options for urban greenspaces, see “Stop using herbicides on pavements and road verges”, “Residential and commercial development – Plant parks and gardens with appropriate native species” and “Residential and commercial development – Alter mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspaces. The study was in France.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in France found that gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used had a higher abundance of butterflies, but gardens where fungicides and snail pellets were not used had a lower abundance of butterflies
