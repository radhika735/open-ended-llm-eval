395: Do birds take bait designed for pest control?
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
If non-target species take poison bait designed for problematic species control then extra care will be needed during control programmes, for example, the use of bait feeders, repellents or dyed bait (see interventions below).
 

Key Messages:
Two studies, one randomised, replicated and controlled, from New Zealand and Australia found no evidence that birds took bait meant for pest control.
