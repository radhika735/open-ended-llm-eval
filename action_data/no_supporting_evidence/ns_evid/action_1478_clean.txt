1478: Implement local no-hunting community policies/traditional hunting ban 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves implementing no-hunting community policies or traditional hunting bans. These differ from national and international policies in that (authorities within) local communities rather than government staff enforce such policies/bans.
            The enforcement of local taboos that forbid the killing of certain primate species is discussed under ‘Strengthen/support/re-install traditions/taboos that forbid the killing of primates’, and installing community control of anti-poaching activities is discussed under ‘Implement community control of patrolling, banning hunting and removing snares’.

Key Messages:

One review found that very few snub nosed monkeys were killed annually at a site in China where it is forbidden to kill wildlife.
One controlled study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that a lowland gorilla population increased after the implementation of a local hunting ban.
One before-and-after study in Belize found that an introduced black howler monkey population increased over time in an area where hunting was controlled, alongside other interventions.
One before-and-after study in Cameroon found that a drill population increased in numbers after being protected by a hunting ban, alongside other interventions.
A study in Nigeria found that populations of Sclater’s monkey increased in an area where hunting of the species was prohibited by local taboos.
