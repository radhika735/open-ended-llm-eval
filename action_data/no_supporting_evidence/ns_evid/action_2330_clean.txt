2330: Exclude or limit number of visitors to reserves or protected areas
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Protected areas are often popular with visitors as they may contain extensive areas suited for outdoor recreation. However, high visitor numbers can damage features that reserves and protected areas are established to protect. Some mammals are shy and are thus deterred by visitors whilst others, such as bears, may come into conflict with human visitors. A policy of excluding, restricting or otherwise limiting human visitors may be put in place to reduce the potential impact of such access on wildlife, including mammals.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves or protected areas. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Ecuador and one was in Thailand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): A site comparison study in Ecuador found that a road with restricted access had a higher population of medium-sized and large mammals compared to a road with unrestricted access.
Survival (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that temporarily restricting visitor access resulted in fewer bears being killed to protect humans.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Three studies (one a before-and-after study), in the USA and Thailand, found that restricting human access to protected areas resulted in increased use of these areas by grizzly bears and leopards.
