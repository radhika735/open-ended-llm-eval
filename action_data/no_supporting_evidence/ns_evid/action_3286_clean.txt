3286: Create mounds or hollows before planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves creating discrete mounds (e.g. by adding blocks of soil, bundles of sticks, other coarse woody debris) or hollows (e.g. by excavation) before planting marsh or swamp vegetation. The scale of this action falls somewhere between reprofiling/relandscaping (large-scale landscape features, tens of metres wide) and disturbing the ground surface (which may create small scale mounds or hollows, millimetres or a few centimetres wide/deep).
Often, this action aims to mimic the natural microtopography of marshes or swamps, which can be created by sediment accumulation, erosion, tree fall, root growth or animal activity (Vivian-Smith 1997, Bruland & Richardson 2005). Microtopography can increase plant diversity, because the different microclimates or microelevations may support different species (Vivian-Smith 1997). Planting into mounds can be useful if seedlings would otherwise be flooded too deeply or for too long (Zamith & Scarano 2010). Large woody debris will also add nutrients and organic matter to a site as it decomposes.
Studies that examine the effects of planting into existing microtopographic features (e.g. mounds), even if they compare effects between different kinds of features, are not summarized as evidence here (e.g. Raulings et al. 2007; Sleeper & Ficklin 2016).
Related actions: Create mounds or hollows, other than to complement planting; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting without creating discrete mounds and/or hollows.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of creating mounds or hollows in freshwater wetlands before planting emergent, non-woody plants. Both studies were in the same wetland in the USA, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that tussock sedge Carex stricta cover was typically similar across plots, after two growing seasons, whether sedges were planted into created mounds or hollows, or planted into flat ground.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Individual plant size (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that planting tussock sedges Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows had no significant effect on their individual biomass, after 1–2 growing seasons, when compared to planting into flat ground.

OTHER

Survival (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in a wetland in the USA found that planting tussock sedge Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows did not improve, and typically reduced, its survival rate compared to planting into flat ground. Survival was monitored after 1–2 growing seasons.
Growth (2 studies): The same studies found that planting tussock sedge Carex stricta into created mounds or hollows typically had no significant effect on its growth rate, over 1–2 growing seasons, compared to planting into flat ground.
