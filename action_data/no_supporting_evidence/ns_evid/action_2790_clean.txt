2790: Establish ‘move-on rules’ for fishing vessels if mammals are encountered
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
‘Move-on rules’ require fishing vessels to move away from an area to alternative fishing grounds if marine or freshwater mammals are encountered. The aim is to prevent injury or death resulting from the entanglement or unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of mammals in fishing gear. The rules may involve moving to an alternative area located a minimum distance away. However, the efficacy of this method depends on mammals being detected, which may be difficult during the night or periods of low visibility. Passive listening devices may be used to aid detection, see Use passive listening devices to detect mammals and prompt fishing vessels to move away.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of establishing move-on rules for fishing vessels if mammals are encountered. The study was in the Great Australian Bight (Australia).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found that introducing measures to delay or relocate fishing if dolphins were encountered, along with releasing trapped dolphins, resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed.
