2592: Install acoustic wildlife warnings along roads
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions may be employed to deter mammals for accessing roads. This can include use of acoustic warnings which can either be devices that emit sounds or modifications to the road surface that produce noise when vehicle tyres pass over them.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing acoustic wildlife warnings along roads. One study was in Demark and one was in Australia.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (2 studies): A before-and-after study in Denmark found that sound from acoustic road markings did not alter fallow deer behaviour. A controlled study in Australia found that Roo-Guard® sound emitters did not deter tammar wallabies from food and so were not considered suitable for keeping them off roads.
