163: Provide bird feeding materials to families with young children
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Feeding birds in gardens is a popular past time in many parts of the world, and there is the possibility that encouraging young children to feed birds may increase their knowledge of local species and their desire to conserve them. Studies describing the effects of feeding on bird populations and reproduction are described in ‘General responses to small/declining populations - Provide supplementary food’.

Key Messages:
A single replicated before-and-after study from the USA found that most children involved in a programme providing families with bird food increased their knowledge of birds, but there was no significant change in environmental attitudes.
