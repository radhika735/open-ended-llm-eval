2647: Leave coarse woody debris in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches that are left after tree harvesting. Coarse woody debris increases the structural diversity at the forest floor. Sometimes, debris may be removed as part of forestry operations, such as for use as biofuel. However, retained coarse woody debris may provide resources on the forest floor that benefit woodland species.
This intervention covers studies where coarse woody debris is left evenly distributed. See also Gather coarse woody debris into piles after felling.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving coarse woody debris in forests. One study was in Canada, one was in the USA and one was in Malaysia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study, in Malaysia found more small mammal species groups in felled forest areas with woody debris than without.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): One out of three replicated studies (two controlled, one site comparison, one before-and-after) in Canada, the USA and Malaysia found that retaining or adding coarse woody debris did not increase numbers or frequency of records of small mammals. The other study found that two of three shrew species were more numerous in areas with increased volumes of coarse woody debris than areas without coarse woody debris.
