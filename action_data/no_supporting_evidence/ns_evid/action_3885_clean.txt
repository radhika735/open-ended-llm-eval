3885: Remove, control or exclude invertebrate herbivores 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Outbreaks of invertebrate herbivores can cause problems for other species, including butterflies and moths, through the competition for food, induced food plant resistance, increased food plant mortality, or increases in predator, parasitoid or pathogen abundance (Scriber 2004). This intervention includes studies investigating the impact of attempting to exclude, remove, or control the density of invertebrate herbivores to allow vegetation to recover, for the benefit of butterfly or moth populations.
For studies on the control of vertebrate herbivores, see “Remove, control or exclude vertebrate herbivores”.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing, controlling or excluding invertebrate herbivores. The study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that at sites fenced to exclude grazing animals there was a higher density of pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies than at unfenced sites.
