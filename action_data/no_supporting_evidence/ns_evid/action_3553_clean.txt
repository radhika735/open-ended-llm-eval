3553: Use visual deterrents on fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles, particularly sea turtles, use visual cues as part of their foraging behaviour (Wang et al. 2009). Taking advantage of this reliance on visual cues by using visual deterrents, such as shark shapes, could be a way to discourage turtle interactions with fishing gear.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using visual deterrents on fishing gear on reptile populations. One study was off the coast of Mexico and one was in the USA.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that shark-shaped and spherical deterrents had mixed effects on a range of captive loggerhead turtle behaviours.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch: (1 study): One replicated, controlled study off the coast of Mexico found that gillnets with floating shark shapes attached to them caught fewer green turtles than unmodified nets.
