1925: Carnivores: Provide live vertebrate prey
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, carnivores hunt both terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate prey. In captivity, carnivores are provided with meat or carcasses and are not able to practice their natural hunting behaviours. Providing captive carnivores with the opportunity to hunt is possible although in some countries there are regulations against feeding live vertebrate prey.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the USA found that hunting behaviour increased and sleeping decreased when a fishing cat was provided with live fish.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that there was no change in the occurrence of stereotypical behaviours in tigers when provided with live fish.
