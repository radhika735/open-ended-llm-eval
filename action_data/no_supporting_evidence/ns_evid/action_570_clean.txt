570: Translocate auks
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Like Procellariiformes (petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses, see previous section), auks show strong homing instincts and so are unlikely to recolonise islands or areas where they have become extinct.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study in the USA and Canada found that 20% of 774 translocated Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica remained in or near the release site, with up to 7% breeding.
