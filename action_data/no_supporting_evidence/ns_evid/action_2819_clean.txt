2819: Use noise aversive conditioning to deter mammals from fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Aversive conditioning is the process of associating a negative stimulus with a secondary behaviour or outcome. For this intervention, it involves associating a negative stimulus (a loud startling sound) with a neutral one (a non-startling sound) when marine and freshwater mammals are carrying out undesirable behaviour (predating on fish catches) to the extent that the neutral stimulus alone deters this behaviour. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in fishing gear. Mammal predation on fish catches may also decrease, which may reduce human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. The study summarised below tested the effects of the first step of this approach only, i.e. pairing a negative stimulus with a neutral one.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using noise aversive conditioning to deter mammals from fishing gear. The study was in the North Pacific Ocean (USA).
