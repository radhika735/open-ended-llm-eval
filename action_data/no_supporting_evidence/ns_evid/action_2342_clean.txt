2342: Treat mammals to reduce conflict caused by disease transmission to humans
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Outbreaks of diseases that can be spread between animals and humans (zoonotic diseases) may result in calls for lethal control of the relevant carrier species. Motivations for lethal control may be reduced if the prevalence of diseases or parasites can be reduced by carrying out treatments in wild populations. This intervention specifically considers ways of reducing the risk of disease transmission to humans rather than ways of reducing the direct impact of disease on wild mammal populations.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of treating mammals to reduce conflict caused by disease transmission to humans. This study was in Germany.
