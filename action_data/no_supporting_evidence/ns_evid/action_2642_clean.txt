2642: Retain dead trees after uprooting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Management or restoration of some habitats involves removing trees. This may occur, for example, in sites where fire suppression has caused woodland to become denser than it has been historically. Retaining uprooted trees can increase structural diversity at ground level. This may in turn increase cover available to some mammal species.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining dead trees after uprooting. This study was in the USA.
