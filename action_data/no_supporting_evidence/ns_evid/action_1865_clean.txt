1865: Amphibians: Vary quality or quantity (UV% or gradients) of enclosure lighting to simulate seasonal changes in the wild 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
For some species, breeding is seasonal and can be triggered by longer periods of sunlight. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.
In captivity, metabolic bone disease can be an issue in amphibians if the correct lighting is not used. It develops as a result of an imbalance of vitamin D3, phosphorous or calcium. Amphibians cannot process calcium without vitamin D, which is activated by ultraviolet light. If the correct lighting is not provided, animals can suffer from brittle or deformed bones. Health problems may affect reproduction in captive animals.

Key Messages:

One replicated study in the UK found that there was no difference in clutch size between frogs given an ultraviolet (UV) boost compared with those who only received background levels. However, frogs given the UV boost had a significantly greater fungal load than frogs that were not UV-boosted.
