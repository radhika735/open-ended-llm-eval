1332: Primates: Provide cut branches (browse)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many primate species are leaf eaters which spend significant amounts of time browsing in the wild. In captivity, pellet and produce-based diets are supplemented with cut branches from trees and shrubs referred to as browse. Browse is an important dietary component but also aims to increase time spent feeding and promote natural foraging behaviours.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the Netherlands and Germany found that when presented with stinging nettles captive gorillas used the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage.
