2539: Reduce pesticide or fertilizer use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides (including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and fertilizers, used especially in agriculture, but also in horticulture, amenity grassland, gardens and other situations, may have a negative effect on wildlife. Through reducing plant and insect diversity, or through direct toxicity, they may also natively impact mammals. Organic farming, an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost and biological pest control, is included within this intervention.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use. Two studies were in the UK, one was in Italy and one was in Argentina.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Argentina found that farming without pesticides or fertilizers did not increase small mammal species richness in field margins.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies, in the UK and Italy, found that reducing pesticide or fertilizer use, by farming organically, increased wood mouse abundance. The other study found that it did not increase European hare abundance.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in Argentina found that farming without pesticides or fertilizers did not increase small mammal use of field margins.
