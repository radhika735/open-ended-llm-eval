2939: Slow rotation of turbine blades at low wind speeds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Most wind turbines operate by a ‘cut-in’ wind speed at which the turbine begins to generate electricity and the blades can move at a maximum rotation speed. However, the blades can still rotate below cut-in speeds when electricity is not being generated. Slowing the rotation of turbine blades below the cut-in speed may reduce bat fatalities, which have been found to be higher at low wind speeds (e.g. Horn et al. 2008, Rydell et al. 2010, Wellig et al. 2018).
For studies that prevent turbine blades from turning below the cut-in speed, see ‘Prevent turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds (‘feathering’)’. Cut-in speeds may also be increased in combination with this intervention. See ‘Increase the wind speed at which turbines become operational (‘cut-in speed’)’.
