93: Use mixed stocking
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Different species of livestock forage differently, therefore stocking multiple species in one area may help to create a more diverse habitat.

 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in the UK found more spiders, harvestmen and pseudoscorpions on sheep-grazed grassland than on mixed livestock-grazed grassland when suction sampling, but not when pitfall-trapping.
