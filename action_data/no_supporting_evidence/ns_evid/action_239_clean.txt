239: Create open patches or strips in permanent grassland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Open patches and strips in permanent grassland can be used, in a similar way to skylark plots (see ‘Create skylark plots’) to provide short, open swards for ground-nesting birds.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that more Eurasian skylarks used fields with open strips in, but that variations in skylark numbers were too great to draw conclusions from this finding.
