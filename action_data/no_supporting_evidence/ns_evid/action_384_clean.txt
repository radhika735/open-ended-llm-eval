384: Control predators not on islands
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
When predators are controlled on continental sites, rather than islands, the chances of eradicating predators are far smaller and may not be desirable – many of the studies we have captured describe the control of native predators.
We have classed landmasses above approximately 5,000 km2 as ‘non-islands’ because the largest island where eradication has so far been attempted (as of July 2011) is South Georgia, South Atlantic, at 3,718 km2.
One study discussing the impacts of predator control on bird communities is described below; studies describing the effects on individual taxa are in subsequent sections.
 

Key Messages:
A single replicated and randomised, paired sites study from the UK found that plots with predator control had increased density and fledgling success of breeding birds.
