2502: Use repellents to reduce cable gnawing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Human-wildlife conflict can arise where animals cause damage to equipment or installations. Damage, such as that caused by gophers to underground cables, can represent substantial financial losses (Ramey & McCann 1997). If repellents can reduce or prevent damage to cables, this might reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using repellents to reduce cable gnawing. This study was in the USA.

Human-wildlife conflict (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that repellents only deterred cable gnawing by northern pocket gophers when encased in shrink-tubing.
