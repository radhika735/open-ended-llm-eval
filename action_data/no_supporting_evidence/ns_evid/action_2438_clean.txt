2438: Keep livestock in enclosures to reduce predation by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Free-ranging livestock may be more vulnerable to attacks by predators than those contained indoors or in enclosures close to farm buildings. Here we consider the effectiveness of such methods of animal husbandry. If successful, this intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators. See also Exclude wild mammals using ditches, moats, walls or other barricades to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of keeping livestock in enclosures to reduce predation by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in Portugal.
