766: Remove the chytrid fungus from ponds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been found to survive in lake water for seven weeks after introduction (Johnson & Speare 2003). Treatment of the aquatic environment may help to reduce the effect of the disease on amphibians. One potential method is completely drying ponds, as a study found that complete drying of the chytrid fungus resulted in 100% mortality (Johnson et al. 2003).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Mallorca found that pond drying and fungicidal treatment of resident midwife toads reduced levels of infection but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis.
