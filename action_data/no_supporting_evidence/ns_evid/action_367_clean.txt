367: Restore or create coastal and intertidal wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Coastal and intertidal wetlands are those that can be inundated with salt water. This can have profound consequences for the vegetation and animal life, as salt-intolerant species are excluded.
This form of habitat creation may form part of coastal protection measures, with habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves being important in reducing the power of waves and so reducing coastal erosion.
 

Key Messages:

All six studies found, from the USA and UK, found that target bird species used restored or created wetlands. Two found that numbers and/or diversity were at least as high as in natural wetlands, one that numbers were higher than in unrestored sites. Three found that bird numbers on wetlands increased over time.
Two studies from the UK found that songbirds and waders decreased following wetland restoration, whilst a study from the USA found that songbirds were more common on unrestored sites than restored wetlands.
