2199: Treat wastewater from intensive livestock holdings
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes an important source of pollution to the marine environment. Agriculture waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourse runoffs and be discharged into the sea (Rawlings et al. 1998). For instance, wastewater from intensive livestock holdings can introduce bacteria, excess nutrients and solid particles. Treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings may reduce pollution levels in the marine environment and reduce associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for other interventions related to pollution from agriculture are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Regulate the use, dosage and disposal of agrichemicals”, “Establish aquaculture to extract the nutrients from run-offs” and “Create artificial wetlands to reduce the amount of pollutants reaching the sea”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
