3185: Designate zones for migration of marshes or swamps as climate changes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Areas could be left undeveloped as spaces for migration of marshes and swamps as climate changes and sea levels rise. This philosophy should be integrated into urban planning, especially along coastlines (Green et al. 2009). For example, in Yankeetown on the coast of Florida, USA, development is prohibited within 50 feet of a wetland to allow space for migration with sea level rise (Anon 2016). Areas for migration should be of reasonable size and ideally connected to existing marshes or swamps. Barriers to habitat migration, such as roads and embankments, may need to be actively removed. Long-term land ownership issues should be considered; it may be necessary to purchase areas designated for habitat migration (DELWP 2016).
We realize that providing evidence for the effects of this intervention will be difficult, but include the action for completeness: it is something that could be done to conserve marsh or swamp vegetation.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of designating zones for migration of marshes or swamps under climate change.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
