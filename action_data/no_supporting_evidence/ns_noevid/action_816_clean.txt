816: Add specific plants to aquatic habitats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Plants can be added to aquatic habitats to increase shade, cover from predators, or egg laying sites or to attract invertebrates or improve water quality, for example.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of adding specific plants, such as emergent vegetation, to aquatic habitats on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
