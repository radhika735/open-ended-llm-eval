1454: Certify mines and market their products as ‘primate friendly’ (e.g. ape-friendly cellular phones)  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Several different certifications already exist that do not relate to primates or their habitats. For example, ‘FAIRTRADE’ certification makes certain that the producers who take part in the initiative are not being exploited by buyers in developed countries and the ‘European Organic Certification’ ensures that organic products are produced following strict EU rules. This intervention aims to certify mining companies that adhere to strict environmental regulations to minimize/mitigate/compensate for their impact on resident primate populations and market their products as ‘primate friendly’ and sell them at a premium.           

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of certifying mines and marketing their products as ‘primate friendly’ on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
