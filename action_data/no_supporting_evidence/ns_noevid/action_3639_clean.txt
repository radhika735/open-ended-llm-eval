3639: Impose noise limits in proximity to reptile habitats and routes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Noise pollution has been identified as having negative effects on many species of wildlife (Francis & Barber 2013). Excessive noise may have adverse impacts on reptile populations, with the potential to cause both avoidance behaviours and physical damage to individuals (Nelms et al. 2016). Imposing noise limits may reduce the potential for harm caused to wild reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of imposing noise limits in proximity to reptile habitats and routes.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
