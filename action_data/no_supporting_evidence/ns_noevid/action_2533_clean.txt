2533: Provide artificial refuges for prey to evade/escape non-native predators
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention considers use of small scale refuges rather than larger predator-free areas protected by fences. Artificial refuges, such as small shelters in otherwise open landscapes, could provide cover for native mammals to escape predation. Refuges are more often employed for reptile conservation, though at least one study found that they were insufficient to mitigate effects of non-native predators (Lettink et al. 2010). For mammals, refuges might entail small shelters, boxes or artificial burrows.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing artificial refuges for prey to evade/escape non-native predators.

'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
