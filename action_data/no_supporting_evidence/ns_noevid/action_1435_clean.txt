1435: Farm more intensively and effectively in selected areas and spare more natural land
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There are a variety of practices and improvements relating to nutrient and water use, disease and pest control, soil fertility, and livestock production that could each contribute to increased agricultural efficiency. Improving yield levels in already cultivated areas could help to reduce current rates of agricultural land-conversion and facilitate the protection of remaining natural habitats.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of farming more intensively and effectively in selected areas to spare more natural land on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
