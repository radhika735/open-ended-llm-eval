3237: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical structure of freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves large-scale deposition of soil or sediment to form the physical structure of a swamp. This can be a cost-effective alternative to depositing sediment in upland areas or in the ocean (LaSalle et al. 1991). Soil or sediment could be placed directly where a swamp is desired, or placed nearby then carried to the desired site by water flows (Foster et al. 2013).
Related actions: Deposit soil/sediment and introduce vegetation; Add sediment in relatively small amounts; Add upland topsoil; Transplant or replace wetland soil in order to introduce swamp vegetation.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects on vegetation, of depositing soil/sediment to form the physical structure of freshwater swamps (without introducing vegetation).
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
