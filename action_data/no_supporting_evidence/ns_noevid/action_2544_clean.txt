2544: Remove topsoil that has had fertilizer added to mimic low nutrient soil
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Removing topsoil may help to reduce fertility of soils as well as removing seeds that are found in topsoil. Both of these outcomes may help the establishment of native plant species, which may in turn influence the abundance of mammal species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of removing topsoil that has had fertilizer added to mimic low nutrient soil.

'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
