1486: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clear-cutting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Patch-retention harvesting, also called ‘clear-cutting with reserves’, entails retaining a certain percentage (typically 10%) of a harvested unit within discrete patches of mature and/or immature trees. It is hoped that primates will resettle and survive in these patches in the long-term. Clear-cut logging (i.e. the removal of all trees at the same time) is practiced on the remaining e.g. 90% of the harvesting unit. The spatial properties of the patches (i.e. size, shape and distance between patches) need to be considered as they are likely to play an important role for their effectiveness in ensuring the long-term survival of the displaced primate populations (Diamond 1975). This logging strategy has been applied mostly in the sub-boreal Spruce Bioclimatic zone.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using patch retention harvesting instead of clear-cutting on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
