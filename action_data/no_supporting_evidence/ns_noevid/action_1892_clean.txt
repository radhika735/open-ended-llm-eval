Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
By providing adequate light levels during the development period of amphibians, skeletal deformities, which result from metabolic bone disease, could be avoided, increasing survival and improving health.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of manipulating quality and quantity of lighting to improve development or survival to adulthood.
