1470: Implement road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
To control the illegal trade in primates, road blocks can be installed on main transport routes used by traders to bring bushmeat and live animals from their natural habitats to urban areas for sale or to hubs of international transport. Law enforcement officers posted at these roadblocks typically inspect cars that pass through, confiscate bushmeat of species that are legally protected and punish these traders (e.g. officially warn them, fine them, arrest them). One correlative study (Stokes et al. 2010) showed that Forestry Management Units (selective logging occurs), in which installing road blocks formed part of several conservation management strategies implemented at these sites, had higher densities for both gorillas and chimpanzees, when compared to a logging concession where no conservation management activities were in place.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of implementing road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
