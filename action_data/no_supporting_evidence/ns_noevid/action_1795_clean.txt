1795: Restore/create peatlands in areas that will be climatically suitable in the future
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It may be wise to prioritize restoration or creation of peatland habitats in areas that will remain or become climatically suitable in the future (rather than areas that are destined to become unsuitable). These areas will also provide space for peatland vegetation to move into as current peatlands become too dry/wet/warm to support their characteristic plants (Oliver et al. 2012).
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of restoring or creating peatlands in areas that will be climatically suitable in the future.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
