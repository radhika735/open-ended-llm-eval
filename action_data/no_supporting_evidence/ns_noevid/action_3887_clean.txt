3887: Increase biosecurity checks 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Butterflies and moths may be vulnerable to non-native diseases, parasites, predators or competitors introduced by international trade, in particular of live plants and fresh food. Since many problematic species will themselves be small invertebrates, detecting and removing them after they have been released into a new location is likely to be almost impossible. Therefore, increasing biosecurity checks on shipments may help to identify and remove potentially invasive species before they arrive in new locations, preventing them from having the opportunity to survive and spread.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing biosecurity checks.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
