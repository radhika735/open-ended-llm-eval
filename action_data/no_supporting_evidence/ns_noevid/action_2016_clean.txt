2016: Plant riparian buffer strips
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation may be planted at the edge of waterways to reduce the amount of pollution entering the water within agricultural and forestry areas, and help protect riparian foraging habitats for bats.
For a similar intervention, see ‘Prevent pollution from agricultural land or forestry from entering watercourses’. See also ‘Retain riparian buffers in logged areas’ and ‘Retain riparian buffers on agricultural land’ for studies that retain riparian buffers as habitat for bats.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting riparian buffer strips on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
