3848: Increase consideration of butterflies and moths in international, national and local conservation plans 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conservation planning, particularly at higher levels, traditionally focuses on charismatic vertebrate species. Despite being among the best studied and widely recognized invertebrates, explicit conservation plans for butterflies, and particularly moths, remain rare. The inclusion of butterflies and moths in conservation plans may help to raise awareness of the species, which may be important for stimulating research into their requirements, or funds for the protection and management of important sites for their conservation (Parsons 2004).
