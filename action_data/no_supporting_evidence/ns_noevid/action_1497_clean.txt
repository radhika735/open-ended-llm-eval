1497: Use 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging area
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves creating ‘set-asides’ for primates, i.e. areas with critical primate habitat/important for primate conservation that are not logged, within logging areas.
            The incorporation of forested corridors linking to- or buffers around critical primate habitat during logging operations is discussed under ‘Incorporate forested corridors or buffers into logged areas’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using 'set-asides' for primate protection within logging area on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
