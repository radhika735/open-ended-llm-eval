1622: Use prescribed burning to mimic natural fire cycle
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed fire is commonly used to reduce fuel loads in shrublands in an attempt to supress wildfires. For the purposes of this synopsis we do not consider this to be a conservation intervention as it is not used to benefit biodiversity. However, prescribed fire can be used to mimic the natural fire cycle of some shrublands to benefit biodiversity.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using prescribed burning to mimic the natural fire cycle on shrublands.

'We found no studiesâ€™ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
