1937: Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to ‘set-aside’ (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. Originally intended as a method of reducing production, set-aside has also been promoted as a way of protecting on-field biodiversity. Set-aside fields that are left to naturally regenerate may provide important foraging habitat for bats within the farmed landscape. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing or retaining set-aside areas in farmland on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
