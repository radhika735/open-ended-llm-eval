2334: Keep dogs indoors or in outside enclosures to reduce threats to wild mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris may have multiple negative impacts on wild mammals including through predation, disease transmission and disturbance (Hughes & Macdonald 2013). In some places, domestic dogs roam freely and are major predators of wild mammals. For example, Wierzbowska et al. (2016) estimated that over 33,000 wild animals (primarily mammals, especially brown hare Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) were killed by free-ranging dogs annually in Poland. Keeping dogs indoors or in outside enclosures may reduce their impacts, including predation, on wild mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of keeping dogs indoors or in outside enclosures to reduce threats to wild mammals.

‘We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
