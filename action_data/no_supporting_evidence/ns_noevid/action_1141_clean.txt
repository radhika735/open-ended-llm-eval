1141: Water primrose: Use of hydrogen peroxide
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Treatment with hydrogen peroxide may offer a potential control method for water primrose Ludwigia spp. although studies on other species suggest that it may not be feasible.  For example, a controlled, replicated pilot experiment on floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides in 2010 in greenhouses in The Netherlands, found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort plants only had a marked effect when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), and that this was still not sufficient to kill the plant (Joost van der Burg 2010).

Key Messages:

No evidence was found for use of hydrogen peroxide to control water primrose.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
