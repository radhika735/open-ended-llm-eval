2886: Recover lost or discarded fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to marine and freshwater mammals. Mammals may become entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes, resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Recovering derelict fishing gear from marine and freshwater environments may reduce the risk of mammal entanglement. However, derelict gear may be difficult to locate and retrieve. Specialist techniques may be required, such as acoustic sonar surveys, aerial surveys, or underwater diver and camera surveys (Drinkman 2018).
For an intervention that involves offering incentives for recovering gear, see Offer incentives to fishers for recovering, reusing or recycling fishing gear. For an intervention related to removing other litter, see Remove litter from marine and freshwater environments.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of recovering lost or discarded fishing gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
