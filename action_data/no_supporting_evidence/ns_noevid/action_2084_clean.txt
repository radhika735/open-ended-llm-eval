2084: Remove utility and service lines after decommissioning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Utility and service lines can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and habitat loss. Along with associated infrastructures (Brigitte et al. 2018), it may be possible to remove utility and service lines after decommissioning (Ekins et al. 2006). This may remove the threat and allow for recolonization and recovery over time. Evidence related to the potential benefits of leaving pipelines in places are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Leave utility and service lines in place after decommissioning”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing utility and service lines after decommissioning on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
