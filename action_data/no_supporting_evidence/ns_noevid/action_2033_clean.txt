2033: Retain native forest and woodland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Native forests and woodland are important for bats providing both roosting and foraging habitat. Retaining native forests and woodland may help to maintain bat populations.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared native forest or woodland that has been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where native forest or woodland has been cut down or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the native forest or woodland and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.
For studies that provide evidence for retaining remnant forest on agricultural land, see ‘Retain remnant forest or woodland on agricultural land’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining native forest and woodland on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
