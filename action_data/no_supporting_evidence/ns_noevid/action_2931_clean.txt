2931: Translocate marine and freshwater mammal species before onset of impactful activities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught marine and freshwater mammals into the wild. Translocations may be carried out prior to the onset of impactful activities to reduce harm to mammals. For example, mammals may be translocated away from potential energy production sites prior to construction. However, this may not be feasible where large numbers of animals are affected. There is also the risk of disease transmission, competition and social disruption at the release site (Germano et al. 2015).
For other interventions related to translocations, see Translocate marine and freshwater mammals to re-establish or boost native populations, Translocate mammals away from aquaculture systems to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Translocate or temporarily bring marine and freshwater mammals into captivity to reduce exposure to disease.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of translocating marine and freshwater mammal species before onset of impactful activities.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
