2870: Remove or clean-up oil pollution following a spill
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can cause serious harm to marine and freshwater mammals (Helm et al. 2014). The control and remediation of oil spills can be undertaken in a multitude of ways, e.g. using booms (floating barriers that contain a spill to a delimited zone) and skimmers (devices that collect oil) to remove oil from the water surface, dispersants that break oil into small droplets, sorbents (materials that adsorb oil), or by controlled burning of the oil (Dave & Ghaly 2011). Different methods have different outcomes and side-effects, but when successful may potentially reduce the risks of toxicity and direct harm to marine and freshwater mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing or cleaning up oil pollution following a spill on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
