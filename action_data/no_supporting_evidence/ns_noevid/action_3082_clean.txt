3082: Implement biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It is often cheaper and easier to prevent problematic species from being introduced to a site than trying to control them afterwards (Leung et al. 2002). This section includes all interventions aiming to directly prevent introductions of problematic species to marshes or swamps: from physical biosecurity measures like cleaning and drying equipment between sites, to legislative measures like banning the sale or ownership of problematic species. Caution: Bans on sale or ownership of problematic species may encourage mass releases into the wild (Hulme 2015).
To be included in this section, studies would have to evaluate the effect of biosecurity measures on wild marsh or swamp vegetation. This section does not include (a) studies only reporting the effects of biosecurity interventions on the problematic organism (e.g. mortality in laboratory tests), or (b) studies reporting changes in human behaviour after the introduction of biosecurity measures (e.g. uptake of biosecurity measures, or whether problematic species are still on sale).
Related actions: Raise public awareness about marshes or swamps, including about problematic species and biosecurity.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of implementing biosecurity measures to prevent introductions of problematic species to marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
