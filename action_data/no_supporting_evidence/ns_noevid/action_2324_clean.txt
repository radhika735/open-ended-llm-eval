2324: Protect mammals close to development areas (e.g. by fencing)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals living at the edge of developed areas may face particular threats from predation by domestic animals, persecution, road traffic and disturbance. Fencing could be erected in some situations, to reduce exposure of wild mammals to such threats.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting mammals close to development areas (e.g. by fencing).

'We found no studies' means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
