3505: Retain/maintain road verges as habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Roads can damage or destroy grassland habitats that host reptiles, but roadside verges may be used by reptiles (e.g. Carthew et al. 2013). Maintaining road verges with reptiles in mind may contribute towards mitigating habitat loss.
Carthew S.M., Garrett L.A. & Ruykys L. (2013) Roadside vegetation can provide valuable habitat for small, terrestrial fauna in South Australia. Biodiversity and conservation, 22, 737–754.
