2955: Flood cropland when fallow to conserve brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years, when crops are not being grown, could allow wetland plant communities to develop temporarily. If this fallow period occurs within a yearly cycle, annual plant species will dominate. If the fallow period is long enough and at the right time of year, these species may be able to complete their life cycle within cropland.
Related interventions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes or swamps; Raise water level to restore/create marshes or swamps from other land uses.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on brackish/salt marsh vegetation, of flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
