1950: Replace culling of bats with non-lethal methods of preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to livestock
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vampire bats have been extensively culled in Latin America to prevent the spread of rabies to livestock. However, research shows that culling is ineffective and may increase the spread of rabies (e.g. Streicker et al. 2012). Non-lethal measures of disease control have been suggested as alternatives, such as vaccinating livestock against rabies (e.g. Benavides et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of replacing culling of bats with non-lethal methods of preventing vampire bats from spreading rabies to livestock on vampire bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
