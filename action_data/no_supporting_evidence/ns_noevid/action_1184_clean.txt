1184: Provide paraffin stoves
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In many areas wood is the main fuel used for cooking and heating. The high demand for firewood can lead to strong pressure on forests. By providing alternative stoves that do not require wood (such as paraffin stoves), less wood is required, which may lead to reduced exploitation of forests.
