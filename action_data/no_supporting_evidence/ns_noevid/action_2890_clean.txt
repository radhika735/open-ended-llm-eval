2890: Establish fishing gear registration programmes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may become entangled in lost or abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Establishing fishing gear registration programmes (e.g. with gear markers displaying vessel, permit or licence numbers) may allow lost or abandoned gear to be traced back to the owner. This may encourage the responsible disposal of gear by fishers and reduce the risk of mammal entanglement.
