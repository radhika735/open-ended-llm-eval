2904: Modify vessels to reduce noise disturbance
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Underwater noise from vessels can disturb marine and freshwater mammals and may cause behavioural changes and stress (Erbe et al. 2018). Modifications may be made to vessels to reduce noise pollution. This may involve using alternative propellor, rudder or hull designs, or ‘quieting’ technologies, such as electric propulsion. Onboard machinery (e.g. engines, generators, pumps) may also be modified to reduce noise pollution. For example, machinery may be relocated within the vessel, attached to resilient mounts or surrounded by sound dampening materials (International Maritime Organization 2014).
Reducing vessel speeds may also reduce noise pollution. See Set and enforce vessel speed limits.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying vessels to reduce noise disturbance on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
