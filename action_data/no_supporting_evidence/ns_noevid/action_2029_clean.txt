2029: Retain existing bat commuting routes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some bats are highly faithful to their commuting routes. Retaining existing commuting routes (e.g. along hedgerows and treelines) allows bats to access important habitats and resources across the landscape. For an intervention that involves creating new commuting routes, see ‘Create new unlit commuting routes using planting’.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared areas where existing bat commuting routes have been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where commuting routes have been removed or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the habitat features used by commuting bats and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining existing bat commuting routes on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
