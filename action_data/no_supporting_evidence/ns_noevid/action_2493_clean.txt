2493: Use fencing to protect water sources for use by wild mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Water, from natural or artificial sources, can be an important resource, shaping the distribution of wild mammals in arid areas. Fencing may be installed to protect these water sources from domestic or wild animals whilst still permitting entry of smaller mammals (e.g. Gaudioso Lacasa et al. 2010).
