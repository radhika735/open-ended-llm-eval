2946: Remove residential or commercial development
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Parking lots, shopping centres, housing, industrial facilities or tourist sites are sometimes built on marshes or swamps. Removing such developments could allow marsh or swamp vegetation to recover (e.g. at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in California, USA; Brennan 2017), or provide an opportunity to create new marshes or swamps.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).
