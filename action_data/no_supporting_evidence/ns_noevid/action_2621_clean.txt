2621: Make introduction of non-native mammals for sporting purposes illegal
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals introduced for sporting purposes may negatively affect native species. This may be through such processes as predation of native mammals (Saunders et al. 2010), through competition for resources or through hybridising with native species (Reid & Montgomery 2007). Banning importation of non-native mammals for sporting purposes could reduce or prevent further such threats.
