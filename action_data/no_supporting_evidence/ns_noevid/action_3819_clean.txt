3819: Purchase fishing vessels from fishers to limit vessel numbers
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing can lead to unsustainable depletion of fish populations through removal of fish and mortality of discards. The purchase or ‘buyback’ of fishing vessels from fishers is a potential management tool to remove capacity from a fleet and reduce the effects of overfishing on fish populations. Removal of vessels may lead to increased fish biomass in the short term; however, long-term success may depend on whether the most productive vessels are removed and whether fishers subsequently re-enter the fishery after purchasing another vessel (Teh et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of purchasing fishing vessels from fishers to limit vessel numbers on marine fish populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
