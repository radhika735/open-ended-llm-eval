3556: Retain offal on fishing vessels instead of discarding overboard
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing boats prepare fish onboard, after catching them, in order to maximise the catch that can be stored. The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Discarding offal overboard during fishing may attract aquatic reptiles and increase the risk of entanglement or capture in gear. Retaining offal on board or disposing of offal at locations and times away from fishing operations may reduce this risk.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of retaining offal on fishing vessels instead of discarding overboard.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
