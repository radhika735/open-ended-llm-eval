3600: Install exclusion devices on fishing gear: Crocodilians
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquatic reptiles may become trapped or entangled in fishing nets (e.g. trawl nets, hoop nets, fyke nets) and traps. Escape devices such as escape holes, sections of larger mesh, or chimneys may be fitted to fishing gear to allow non-target animals to escape after they have entered fishing gear.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles or Snakes & lizards.
For studies that discuss the effect of using devices that exclude reptiles from fishing gear, see Install escape devices on fishing gear, and for studies on the effect of using a combination of exclusion and escape devices see Install exclusion and escape devices on fishing gear.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of installing exclusion devices on fishing gear on crocodilian populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
