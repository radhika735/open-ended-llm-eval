1136: Water primrose: Biological control using native herbivores
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Increasing the numbers of a native species can increase the level of foraging to levels higher than normally endured by the target (Gassmann et al. 2006).  This can potentially be used as a means of controlling invasive plants.  For example, a controlled, replicated field experiment on a different plant species, Parrotfeather Myriophyllum aquaticum in the USA found that over a two year period beaver Castor canadensis herbivory reduced the abundance of invasive Parrotfeather by nearly 90% (Parker et al. 2007).

Key Messages:

No evidence was found on the use of biological control of water primrose using native herbivores.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
