2787: Inform local communities and fishers about the negative impacts of hunting to reduce the killing of marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Education programmes that emphasize the negative impacts of killing marine and freshwater mammals may reduce hunting pressure. However, there are many factors that influence human behaviour, and it may be necessary to collaborate with social scientists to design appropriate education programs.
