100: Avoid use of lead shot
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Spent lead shot may be ingested by wildlife such as waterfowl, scavenging birds and mammals which may result in lead poisoning. This intervention involves avoiding the use of lead shot for instance by using alternative shot types such as steel or copper (Knott et al. 2009).
Knott J., Gilbert J., Green R.E. & Hoccom D.G. (2009) Comparison of the lethality of lead and copper bullets in deer control operations to reduce incidental lead poisoning; field trials in England and Scotland. Conservation Evidence, 6, 71-78.

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of avoiding the use of lead shot on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
