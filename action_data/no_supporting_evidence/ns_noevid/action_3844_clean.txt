3844: Change turbine colour to reduce insect attraction 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Like all insects, butterflies and moths are attracted to colours, but show greater attraction to some colours than others (Kevan 1983). Common wind turbine colours (white and grey) have been found to attract more insects, including butterflies and moths, than other colours such as purple (Long et al. 2011). Therefore, painting turbines in less attractive colours may reduce the disturbance caused to butterfly and moth behaviour.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of changing turbine colour to reduce attraction to butterflies and moths.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
