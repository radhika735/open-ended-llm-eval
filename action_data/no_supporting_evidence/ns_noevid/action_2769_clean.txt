2769: Eliminate flags of convenience
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing vessel owners are required to register or licence their vessel in a country and it is subsequently deemed the nationality of the vessel, falling under the laws and jurisdiction of that country. This is called its “flag state” (see ‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel’). A flag of convenience is a business practice whereby a vessel is registered in a country other than that of the vessel’s owner. Adopting a flag of convenience can make it easier to engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity (Gianni & Simpson 2005). Elimination of flags of convenience may thus help prevent illegal fishing and protect fish populations and marine environments from the threat of over exploitation.
Evidence for a related intervention describing the use of the flag on marine vessels is summarized under ‘Enforcement and Compliance to Reduce Illegal Fishing - Use flags to signal the legal nationality of a fishing vessel’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of eliminating flags of convenience on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
