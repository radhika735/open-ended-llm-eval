1769: Physically damage problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers physically damaging problematic plants in order to control them. Damage may kill plants directly, increase their susceptibility to disease, slow their growth and/or prevent reproduction. This section includes damage done specifically to the plants (e.g. by crushing or seed head removal) as well as general soil disturbance that damages plants growing in it.
Caution: To avoid regrowth, it may be necessary to remove plant fragments. Also, damaging plants by disturbing peat can destroy the physical structure of the peat.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: remove, bury or disturb peatland surface.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of physically damaging problematic plants.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
