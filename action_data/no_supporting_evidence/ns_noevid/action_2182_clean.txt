2182: Use double hulls to prevent oil spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can be disastrous to marine life, including subtidal benthic invertebrates (White et al. 2012). Double hulls, where the bottom and sides of ships have two layers of watertight surfaces, can be used to prevent oil spills and have been required in some countries since the 1990s (Alcock 1992). Double hulls can reduce vessel damage to tankers when involved in accidents, and their use has been shown to significantly reduce the number of oil spills (Glen 2010; Yip et al. 2011). Using double hulls may potentially reduce the risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates from pollution following accidental oil spills.
Evidence for other interventions related to oil pollution are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Remove or clean-up oil pollution following a spill”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using double hulls to prevent oil spills on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
