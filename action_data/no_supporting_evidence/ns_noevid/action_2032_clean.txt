2032: Retain wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wetland habitats are important for bats, providing a foraging and drinking resource (e.g. see Korine et al. 2016). Retaining wetlands may help to maintain bat populations.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared wetlands that have been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where wetlands have been removed or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the wetlands and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining wetlands on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
