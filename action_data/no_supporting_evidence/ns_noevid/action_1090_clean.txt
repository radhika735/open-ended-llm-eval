1090: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Exposure to disease-causing organisms
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disease-causing organisms (pathogens) have the potential to control gammarid populations by reducing reproductive outputs, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the use of disease-causing organisms to control Ponto-Caspian gammarids.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
