2928: Place orphaned or abandoned marine and freshwater mammal young with foster parents
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
To increase chances of survival, orphaned or abandoned marine and freshwater mammal young may be rescued and placed with wild foster parents. For rare or threatened species, this may help to maintain or boost population sizes. The adoption of an orphaned Indo-Pacific dolphin calf by an unrelated adult female was observed in the wild without human intervention (Sakai et al. 2016).
