3020: Physically exclude vehicles
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vehicles such as cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats can directly damage marsh and swamp vegetation (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999; Kelleway 2005). They can also compress and rut soft, wet soils, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects vegetation. Waves created by boats and jet skis can increase erosion of lake and sea shores (Bilkovic et al. 2017). Vehicles could be physically excluded from pristine marshes and swamps to prevent damage, or from damaged areas to let them recover. Physical barriers could be fences, fallen trees or areas of water/wet ground.
Related actions: Restrict vehicle use, using non-physical means such as signs or voluntary codes.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically excluding vehicles from marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
