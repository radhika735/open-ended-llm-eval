3592: Cease or prohibit the disposal of mining waste (tailings) at sea or in rivers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mine tailings, which are the ore waste of mines, typically in the form of a mud-like material, originate from both coastal and land-based mining activities and can be disposed of in aquatic environments causing chemical contamination. Ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of mining waste at sea or in rivers may reduce pollution and potential harm to aquatic and semi-aquatic reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of mining waste (tailings) at sea or in rivers.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
