3788: Provide reptiles with escape routes from canals, drains and ditches
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles may be attracted to canals, drains and ditches for drinking, or may need to cross such obstacles while dispersing through the landscape. When such waterways have steep sides, reptiles may fall in and be unable to escape, or aquatic reptiles may enter deliberately but struggle to exit the water. Escape routes may be installed to enable reptiles that have fallen in or otherwise entered the water to escape back onto land. These may take the form or ramps, ladders, shallow inlets or other structures that reptiles could use to climb out.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on their populations of providing reptiles with escape routes from canals drains and ditches.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
