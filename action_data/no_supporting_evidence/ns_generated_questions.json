    "D": "Increase lighting to improve human safety without considering bats",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "proof_of_correctness": "The correct answer is B because the evidence suggests that different bat species respond differently to lighting changes, and that timing of light restrictions should coincide with peak activity. Conducting species-specific surveys would allow for tailored strategies that balance the needs of different bat species. Option A ignores the species-specific responses. Option C is an extreme measure not supported by the evidence. Option D prioritizes human needs without considering bat conservation, which goes against the goal of the question.",

    "source_action": 101,
    "documentation": "The text states that legislative protection is 'Perhaps the most commonly used intervention in response to declining species', but its effectiveness is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "proof_of_correctness": "While the text doesn't directly mention complementary measures, public education (B) is likely to be most effective in supporting legislation by increasing compliance and understanding. Habitat availability (A) could be helpful but doesn't directly address persecution. Captive breeding (C) doesn't address the root cause of persecution. Introducing predators (D) would likely harm bird populations further. The text's focus on persecution suggests that changing human behavior through education would be most complementary to legislation.",

    "proof_of_correctness": "While the text suggests a correlation between legislation and increased raptor populations, it doesn't prove causation. A thorough analysis would involve comparing with unprotected areas (A), analyzing habitat changes (B), and assessing food availability (C). All these factors could influence raptor populations independently of legislation. Therefore, all of these analyses (D) are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the legislation's effectiveness.",

    "proof_of_correctness": "The mixed results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for all species. Abandoning legislation (A) is too extreme given some positive results. Uniform application (B) ignores species-specific needs. Focusing only on responsive species (D) neglects other potentially threatened species. Developing species-specific measures (C) is the most appropriate as it allows for tailored protection based on each species' unique threats and ecological needs, addressing the variability in responses observed in the text.",
