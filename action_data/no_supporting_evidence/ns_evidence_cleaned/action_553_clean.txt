553: Provide supplementary food for nectar-feeding songbirds to increase adult survival
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
As with experiments on hummingbirds, experiments on the preferences of nectar-feeding songbirds can be difficult to interpret and compare between studies. See ‘Provide supplementary food to increase adult survival – Hummingbirds’ for details.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from Australia and New Zealand found that ten species of honeyeaters and stitchbirds Notiomystis cincta readily used feeders supplying sugar solutions, with seasonal variations varying between species and stitchbirds spending more time foraging for insects when food was supplied.
A series of ex situ trials using southern African birds found that most species tested showed a preference for sucrose solutions over glucose or fructose. One study found that sunbirds and sugarbirds only showed such a preference at low (equimolar) concentrations. Two more studies found that two species showed preferences for sucrose when comparing 20% (by weight) solutions, although a third species did not show this preference. All species rejected solutions with xylose (a natural sugar in nectar) added. A final study found that sucrose preferences only became apparent at equicalorific concentrations high enough for birds to subsist on.
