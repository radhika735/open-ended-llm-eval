459: Reduce chemical inputs in permanent grassland management
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reducing chemical inputs into permanent grasslands is often used in conjunction with reducing the mowing height or delaying the first mowing or grazing date on grasslands. Studies that examine several of these interventions at once are discussed in ‘Threat: Agriculture – Reduce management intensity on permanent grasslands’.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated, controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to pasture plots with no fertiliser, compared to control plots.
