1921: Carnivores: Scatter food around enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, many felids, canids and ursids have to forage for food over large areas whereas in captivity, food is often presented to animals directly without any need for active searching. Potentially, more natural foraging conditions can be simulated by scattering food throughout enclosures and hiding food in materials covering the floor (e.g. straw) for longer periods. Scatter feeds aim to increase foraging and exploratory behaviours potentially providing a more stimulating environment.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in Brazil found that scattered feeding increased locomotion in maned wolves.
One replicated study in Brazil found that maned wolves spent more time in the section of their enclosure with scattered food than in a section with food on a tray.
