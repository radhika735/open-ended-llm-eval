721: Use mixed pasture
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
This involves growing more than one species of forage crop (grasses and legumes) in a pasture to control invertebrate or weed pests in pastoral farmland. The use of mixed pastures to suppress pests in arable crops is not included here but relevant to other actions, e.g. ‘Include plants that are repellent or suppressive to pests in crop rotations’ and ‘Grow cover crops that are repellent or suppressive to pests when the field is empty’ (for inclusion in a future synopsis).
Here we present evidence from seven of 10 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Weeds: Two of two studies (both randomised, replicated trials, one also controlled) from the USA found reduced weeds in mixed compared to monoculture pasture. Pests: Five studies from North America measured pests including four randomised, replicated, controlled tests. One study found fewer pests and two studies found reductions in some pest groups or in some pasture mixes. One study found no effect and another found more pests, although the effect was potentially inseparable from grazing treatments. Crop mortality: One randomised, replicated study from the USA found no effect on forage crop mortality caused by nematodes.Yield: Two of five studies (including two randomised, replicated, controlled tests) from North America found increased forage crop yields and two studies found mixed effects depending on the crop type and year. One study found no effect.
Crops studied were alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, chicory, cicer milkvetch, clovers, fescues, oats, ryegrass, other grasses, other legumes, rapeseed and turnip.
