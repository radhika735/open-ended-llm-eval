846: Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Leave-tree harvest retains a low density of high-quality trees uniformly through the forest stand. Trees can be retained in groups or dispersed and may contain trees with structural characteristics important to wildlife. Compared to clearcutting, this type of management can help maintain forest species.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to clearcutting, leaving a low density of trees during harvest did not result in higher salamander abundance.
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, leaving a low density of trees during harvest decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition.
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs, eggs per female or proportion of juveniles were similar or lower in harvested plots that included leave-tree harvests, depending on species and time since harvest.
