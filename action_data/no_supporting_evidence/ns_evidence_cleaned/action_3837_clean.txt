3837: Establish “green infrastructure” in urban areas  
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Planting rooftops in urban areas, and growing plants up vertical structures such as walls and lamp-posts, often termed “green infrastructure”, is becoming increasingly popular, and is usually done with the aim of reducing pollution and run-off, or to improve building insulation (Dunnett & Kingsbury 2008). However, they may also be put in place to increase biodiversity, by providing habitat for a range of species (Oberndorfer et al. 2007), including nectar resources or egg-laying sites for butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of establishing “green infrastructure in urban areas on butterflies and moths. This study was in Taiwan.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Taiwan found that green roofs had a lower species richness of butterflies than urban parks.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Taiwan found that green roofs had a lower abundance of butterflies than urban parks, but the abundance was higher on older green roofs with more nectar plant species in a larger area.
