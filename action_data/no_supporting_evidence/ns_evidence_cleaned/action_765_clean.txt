765: Immunize amphibians against chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Chytridiomycosis infection often spreads rapidly once it has been introduced to amphibian populations, causing mass mortality and population declines. However, some species of amphibians appear to be resistant to developing the disease if they have previously been exposed to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Hanselmann et al. 2004). This suggests that it may be possible to reduce infection by injecting animals with dead chytrid fungus to stimulate a protective immune response.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that vaccinating mountain yellow-legged frogs with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or mortality.
