2417: Install electric fencing to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild predatory mammals can come into conflict with humans if they predate domestic livestock. This conflict can be reduced if wild mammals can be effectively excluded from livestock enclosures. Electric fences are one means of doing this. If successful at reducing predation of livestock by carnivores, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such species.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of installing electric fencing to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Six studies were in the USA (and a further one was presumed to be in the USA) and one each was in Canada, South Africa, Brazil and Spain.

Human-wildlife conflict (11 studies): Six out of 10 randomized and/or controlled or before-and-after studies (including eight replicated studies), in the USA (and a further one presumed to be in the USA), Canada, Brazil and Spain, found that electric fences reduced or prevented entry to livestock enclosures or predation of livestock by carnivores. Two studies found that some designs of electric fencing prevented coyotes from entering enclosures and killing or wounding lambs. The other two studies found electric fencing did not reduce livestock predation or prevent fence crossings by carnivores. A before-and-after study in South Africa found that electrifying a fence reduced digging of burrows under the fence that black-backed jackals could pass through.
