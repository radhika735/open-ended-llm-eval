1730: Retain/create habitat corridors in farmed areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitat corridors are strips that link two larger habitat patches – in this case preventing peatland patches from being separated by agricultural land. By connecting the habitat patches, corridors could improve survival prospects of peatland plant populations. Seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can more easily move between the habitat patches (perhaps carried by animals), maintaining populations and diversity in each (Damschen et al. 2006). Caution: Habitat corridors can have negative effects. For example, corridors can allow diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).
To help you interpret the summarized study, peat swamps in South East Asia typically contain 30–122 large (trunk diameter &gt;10 cm) tree species/ha (Posa et al. 2011).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: retain/create habitat corridors in areas of energy production or mining.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation, in habitat patches or within corridors, of retaining or creating habitat corridors in farmed areas.This study was in a tropical peat swamp.
Vegetation structure (1 study): One study in Indonesia found that a peat swamp forest corridor contained 5,819 trees/ha. This included 331 large trees/ha, 1,360 saplings/ha and 4,128 seedlings/ha.  
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study recorded 18–29 tree species in the peat swamp forest corridor (the number of species depending on the size class).
