1569: Regularly play TV & radio announcements to raise primate conservation awareness  
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
TV and radio announcements can be used to inform the population and raise their awareness about primate conservation on a more national level. In many developing countries, radio represents the most accessible medium to people in both urban and rural areas. For example, Mathod & Puit (2008) describe how national radio broadcasts in the Republic of Congo is used to regularly (twice a week) broadcast announcements that highlight the importance of great apes and their status as protected species in three different languages. In addition to the radio broadcast, four films were regularly shown on television. These programmes produced by the national channel ‘TV Congo’, showcased the activities connected with gorilla reintroduction, the management of the Lésio-Louna Reserve, the protected status of great apes, and the issues associated with the trafficking of these species.
