1903: Carnivores: Feed a plant-derived protein diet
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many captive, exotic animals are fed diets based on the nutritional requirements of their closest domestic relative. However, these diets for domestic animals are not always suitable for non-domestic species with different wild feeding behaviours. This can cause long-term health problems such as cystinuria, a metabolic defect in maned wolves.

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study and one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that a plant-derived protein diet increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine levels in maned wolves compared to a (supplemented) animal-based protein diet.
