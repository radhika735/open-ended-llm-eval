3759: Use artificial insemination
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
During programmes to rear endangered animals in captivity, in preparation for reintroductions into the wild, artificial insemination may be used to initiate pregnancies. The technique may be used instead of natural mating in situations where animals are being kept at different facilities; to increase pregnancy rates; or where natural mating has failed. It may also be carried out using preserved sperm for purposes of maintaining genetic diversity.
Studies included here are those identified by our searches of conservation journals. It is likely that other relevant studies exist in biological journals that specialize in reproduction.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using artificial insemination on reptile populations. This study was in New Zealand.
