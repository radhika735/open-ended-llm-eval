2393: Create beetle banks on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Beetle banks are raised strips which run through a field, typically planted with grasses. They primarily serve as an overwintering habitat for beetles, which provide pest control in the spring. By dividing the field, beetle banks reduce the distance that predators have to travel to reach the centre of the crop, a potential problem if overwintering habitat occurs only at the field edge. Beetle banks may also harbour other wildlife, such as small mammals.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of creating beetle banks on farmland. This study was in the UK.
