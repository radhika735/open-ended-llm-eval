167: Mark or tint windows to reduce collision mortality
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Two randomised, replicated and controlled studies (one ex situ) found that marking windows did not appear to reduce bird collisions. However, when windows were largely covered with white cloth, fewer birds flew towards them.
A randomised, replicated and controlled study found that fewer birds collided with tinted windows than with un-tinted ones, although the authors noted that the poor reflective quality of the glass could have influenced the results.
