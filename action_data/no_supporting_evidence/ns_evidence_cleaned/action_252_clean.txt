252: Increase water turbidity to reduce fish predation by birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds are visual predators and rely on detecting prey within the water in order to hunt. By obscuring predators’ search images overall predation rates might decrease and reduce bird-human conflict in aquaculture operations.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised trial in France found that little egret Egretta garzetta foraging efficiency was lower in turbid water than clear.
