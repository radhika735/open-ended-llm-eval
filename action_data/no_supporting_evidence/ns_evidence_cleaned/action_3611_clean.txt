3611: Use dyed bait
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Changing the colour of bait may reduce the attractiveness of bait to reptiles. This may reduce reptile captures and entanglements in fishing gear, and in doing so reduce the loss of catch for fishers.
See also: Use a different bait type and Change hook baiting technique.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using dyed bait on reptile populations. One study was in Costa Rica and one was in the North Pacific.

Use (1 study): One randomized, paired, controlled study in Costa Rica found that loggerhead and Kempâ€™s ridley turtles showed mixed preferences for dyed compared to non-dyed bait in captive trials.

Unwanted catch (2 studies): Two paired studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in Costa Rica and the North Pacific found that hooks with dyed bait caught a similar number of olive ridley and green turtles and loggerhead turtles compared to hooks with non-dyed bait.
