3130: Introduce organisms to control problematic plants: freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves biological control: managing the abundance or distribution of problematic organisms via their enemies. Enemies of problematic plants could be disease-causing microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects, fish or even other plants (to compete with or parasitize problematic plants). Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002). Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016), and could damage non-target plants or restrict their establishment (Iannone & Galatowitsch 2008). Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have successfully introduced a biocontrol agent that persisted in the environment. The agent must have been introduced with a clear aim to control problematic plants.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Use grazing to control problematic plants.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing organisms (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA. It involved introducing plants to compete with problematic plants.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a petunia-invaded floodplain swamp in the USA found that plots planted with wetland herbs had greater overall plant species richness than unplanted plots, over the year after planting.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that planted plots had greater native plant species richness than unplanted plots, over the year after planting.
