516: Foster eggs or chicks of petrels and shearwaters with wild non-conspecifics (cross-fostering) 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If the wild populations of a species are very small then it may not be possible to foster offspring to conspecifics. However, it may be possible to foster chicks and eggs to a similar, but more abundant species, if one is present. This can increase the reproductive output of the wild population of the endangered species, or even allow for the reintroduction of a population into parts of its former range.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated and partially controlled study from Hawaii found that Newell’s shearwater Puffinus newelli eggs fostered to wedge-tailed shearwater P. pacificus nests had high fledging rates.
