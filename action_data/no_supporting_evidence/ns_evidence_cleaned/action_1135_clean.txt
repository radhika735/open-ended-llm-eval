1135: Water primrose: Biological control using co-evolved, host specific herbivores
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
One-off introduction of a co-evolved, host-specific herbivore from the area of origin of the invasive pest can potentially provide sustainable control without affecting non-target indigenous plants.
Some studies have reported heavy damage caused to water primrose in the field by herbivorous insects.  For example, the flea beetle Lysathia flavipes has been reported to cause heavy damage in the field to creeping water primrose Ludwigia peploides, although feeding behaviour was reportedly not specific (Cordo & DeLoach 1982a).  It has also been reported that sterile grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella have been used to control large-flower primrose-willow Ludwigia grandiflora (Manuel 1989) although grass carp are non-selective herbivores in which case they could harm native species.
Some studies reference damage caused to water primrose by certain species of insects without referencing their specificity.  For example, a study published in 2000 reports that three beetles, comprising two Lysathia spp. and a Macrohaltica spp., and also the lesser vine Sphinx moth Pholus fasciatus, damage water primrose in Colombia but no reference is made to specificity (Cuevas Medina 2000).
In contrast, other studies appear to have found host-specific agents.  For example, a specificity study in Argentina, found that adults of the weevils Tyloderma spp. A and Tyloderma spp. B appear to have creeping water primrose as their only host plant (Cordo & DeLoach 1982b).

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated field study in China, found a flea beetle caused heavy feeding destruction when added to field cages containing prostrate water primrose seedlings, and was specific to the prostrate water primrose and Indian toothcup.
A replicated, before-and-after field study in the USA found that introduction of flea beetles to a pond significantly reduced the abundance of large-flower primrose-willow.
