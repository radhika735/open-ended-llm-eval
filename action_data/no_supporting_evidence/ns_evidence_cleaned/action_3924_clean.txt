3924: Leave unharvested crop headlands within arable fields 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting crops creates a dramatic change in the farmed landscape, by suddenly and simultaneously removing plants, which may be providing nectar resources to butterflies and moths, from a large area. Even if butterflies and moths are not using the crop itself, harvesting disturbs the structure of the field, and may cause mortality of caterpillars living on other plant species within or around the crop. Leaving unharvested strips, known as headlands, at the edge of fields may provide both shelter and a continued resource availability to butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of leaving unharvested crop headlands within arable fields. This study was in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in France found that unharvested alfalfa headlands had a greater species richness of butterflies than harvested alfalfa or wheat fields.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in France found that unharvested alfalfa headlands had a higher abundance of butterflies than harvested alfalfa or wheat fields.
