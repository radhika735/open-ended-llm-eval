3709: Plant native species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Planting vegetation can help to relatively rapidly re-establish habitats after human disturbance. This may benefit reptile populations.
Studies that combine native species planting with other restoration activities are discussed under Whole habitat restoration.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of planting native species on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Occupancy/range (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that an area reseeded and replanted with native vegetation was colonized and abandoned at different times by two snake and one lizard species, and one other lizard species may have remained, but in low numbers.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that grasslands reseeded with both native and non-native grasses were used by Texas horned lizards.
