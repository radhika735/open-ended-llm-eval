3717: Disturb soil/sediment surface
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many habitats depend on disturbances such as grazing to maintain structural habitat diversity, for example through trampling, and therefore support populations of species that depend on that disturbance. Tilling or soil scarification may be used as a way to disturb soils where grazing is not a viable option.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of disturbing the soil/sediment surface on reptile populations. One study was in Sweden and the other was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Sweden found that after sand patches were created by soil scarification within clearings created by tree felling, sand lizards colonized, abundance then declined, but then increased once more, larger clearings were created.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One randomized study in the USA found that tilled areas were used more frequently by Blanding’s turtles for nesting than mown or weeded areas.
