2582: Use vaccination programme
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Vaccinating wild mammals can be challenging, due to difficulties in administering vaccines in appropriate doses to target animals. Only in particular cases, such as when animals may be affected by a zoonotic disease, that could spread to humans or domestic livestock, or when particularly endangered mammal populations are threatened, is vaccination likely to be attempted.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using vaccination programmes. Three studies were in the UK and one study was in each of Belgium, Spain, Poland and Ethiopia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in Poland found that following an anti-rabies vaccination programme, red fox numbers increased.
Condition (6 studies): Five studies (including three replicated, three controlled and two before-and-after studies) in Belgium, Spain and the UK found that following vaccination, rabies was less frequent in red foxes, numbers of Eurasian badgers infected with tuberculosis was reduced and European rabbits developed immunity to myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. One of the studies also found that vaccination reduced the speed and extent of infection in infected Eurasian badgers. A study in Ethiopia found that following vaccination of Ethiopian wolves, a rabies outbreak halted.
