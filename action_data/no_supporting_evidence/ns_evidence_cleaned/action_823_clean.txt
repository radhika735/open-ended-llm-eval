823: Control invasive plants
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Non-native plant species can be introduced into or naturally invade terrestrial habitat or water bodies, where they can out-compete native species altering the habitats. For example, in the UK swamp stonecrop Crassula helmsii can out-compete native plant species and form thick mats covering whole ponds. In parts of the USA, invasive reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea is widespread and develops dense, tall stands in shallow wetland habitats. Invasive water fern Azolla filiculoides has been found to cause declines in amphibian populations (Gratwicke & Marshall 2003) and Japanease knotweed Fallopia japonica to reduce foraging success of green frogs Rana clamitans (Maerz et al. 2005).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the UK found that aquatic and terrestrial habitat management that included controlling swamp stonecrop, along with release of captive-reared toadlets, tripled a population of natterjack toads.
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that Oregon spotted frogs laid eggs in areas where invasive reed canarygrass had been mown more frequently than where it was not mown.
