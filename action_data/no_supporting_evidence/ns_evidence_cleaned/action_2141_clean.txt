2141: Use a larger mesh size on trammel nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some fisheries use static nets, such as trammel nets, that are left in the water to passively catch the commercially targeted species. Trammel nets are a wall of netting, usually comprised of three layers:  a slack central layer with a small mesh sandwiched between two outer layers with a much larger mesh. The net is kept vertical by floats on the headrope and weights on the bottom rope. Trammels are considered to have less environmental impact than trawl nets, as they have minimal contact with the seabed and are more species and size-selective, however they have been shown to also result in some unwanted catch of invertebrates (Erzini et al. 2006; Gonçalves et al. 2007). To reduce the amount of unwanted catch in trammel net fishing, the mesh size can be increased, to potentially allow more organisms to escape (Gonçalves et al. 2008).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of using a larger mesh size on trammel nets on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the North Atlantic Ocean (Portugal).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that using larger mesh sizes in the inner and/or outer panels of trammel nets did not affect the community composition of unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates (discard).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that using larger mesh sizes in the inner and/or outer panels of trammel nets did not reduce the abundance of unwanted catch of non-commercial invertebrates (discard).
