1030: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Encouraging predators
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
High levels of predation, especially from fish, may help to reduce crayfish population density. A study of red swamp crayfish introduced to Portugal (Correia 2001) found that mammal predators included red fox, otter, common genet and Egyptian mongoose but not weasel, polecat, stone marten, badger or wild cat. The study reported important bird predators as night heron and white stork, and to a lesser extent little egret, purple heron and grey heron.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies in Italy found that eels fed on the red swamp crayfish and reduced population size. 
One replicated, controlled study from France in 2001 found that pike predated red swamp crayfish.
