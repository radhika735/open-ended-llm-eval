2496: Use light/lasers to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention specifically refers to use of directional light or lasers aimed at animals. If such lights can reduce crop damage by mammals, this may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such species. See also Use lights and sound to deter crop damage to reduce human-wildlife conflict.
