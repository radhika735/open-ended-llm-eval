525: Provide supplementary food for gulls, terns and skuas to increase reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Four studies of three experiments from Europe and Alaska found that providing supplementary food increased fledging success or chick survival in two gull species, although a study from the UK found that this was only true for one island, with abnormally low breeding success. A second island with higher success was not affected by feeding. Two of the experiments fed parent birds and one fed the chicks directly.
One study from the Antarctic found no effect of feeding parent skuas on productivity.
One study from Alaska found increased chick growth when parents were fed; one study from the Antarctic found no increase in chick growth.
