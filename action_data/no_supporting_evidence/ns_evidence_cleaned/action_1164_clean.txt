1164: Restore wood pastures (e.g. introducing grazing)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Wood pastures are semi-open pasture woodlands. Generally, they are maintained by grazing. However, when wood pastures are no longer maintained, other interventions (such as partial harvesting) may be necessary to restore their open character.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated paired study in Sweden found that partial harvesting in abandoned wood pastures increased tree seedling density, survival and growth.
