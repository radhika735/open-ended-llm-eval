749: Manage ditches
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Intensification of agricultural and other land management can result in loss of ditch biodiversity through activities such as mowing, grazing and use of fertilizer and pesticides leading to water pollution. These can have significant effects on amphibian populations. Ditch management practices such the frequency, season and technique used to clean or dredge ditches have also been found to affect the presence of amphibians (Twisk et al. 2000). Management practices that maintain and increase species diversity should therefore be encouraged.

Key Messages:

One controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers.
One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally.
