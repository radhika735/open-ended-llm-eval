858: Translocate great crested newts
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Four of six studies (including one review and one replicated study) in the UK found that translocated great crested newts maintained or established breeding populations. The review found that populations were present one year after release in 37% of cases and one study found that although translocations maintained a population in the short term, within three years breeding failed in 48% of ponds. One systematic review of 31 great crested newt studies found that there was no conclusive evidence that mitigation that included translocations resulted in self-sustaining populations.
One review in the UK found that great crested newts reproduced following 56% of translocations, in some cases there was also release of head-started larvae and/or habitat management.
