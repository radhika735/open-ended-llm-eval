524: Provide supplementary food for auks to increase reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled studies from the UK found that Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica chicks provided with supplementary food were significantly heavier than control chicks. One study found differences between populations, suggesting some are more food-limited than others.
The two UK studies found that fed chicks fledged at the same time as controls, whilst a randomised, replicated and controlled study from Canada found that tufted puffin Fratercula cirrhata chicks supplied with supplementary food fledged later than controls.
The Canadian study found that fed chicks had faster growth by some, but not all, metrics.
