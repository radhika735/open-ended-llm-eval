2390: Use repellent on slug pellets to reduce non-target poisoning
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Poisons used to control slugs may also be ingested by non-target species, such as rodents. Such poisoning can lead to declines in rodent numbers (Shore et al. 1997). Substances that make slug pellets unattractive to small mammals, yet still effective on slugs, may help to reduce small mammal losses
