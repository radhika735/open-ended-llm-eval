1619: Re-route paths to reduce habitat disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Closing or re-routing paths may reduce trampling by humans and disturbance from bikes and other vehicles. This may allow plants to recover from human disturbance.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after trial in AustraliaÂ found that closing paths did not alter shrub cover, but did increase the number of plant species in an alpine shrubland.
