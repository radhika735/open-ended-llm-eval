2855: Use deterrents to reduce predation on marine and freshwater mammals by native species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves using deterrents to reduce predation on marine and freshwater mammals by native species. This may be attempted when particularly endangered mammal populations are threatened by unsustainable levels of predation. Deterrents may include the presence of humans or playback of human-related sounds.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using deterrents to reduce predation by native species on marine mammals. The study was in the North Pacific Ocean (USA).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One controlled study in the North Pacific Ocean found that neither boat motor sounds nor the presence of humans reduced Galapagos shark predation on Hawaiian monk seal pups, although shark presence was low throughout the study.
