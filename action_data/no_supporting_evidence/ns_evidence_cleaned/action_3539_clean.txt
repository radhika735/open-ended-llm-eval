3539: Commercially breed reptiles to reduce pressure on wild populations
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife breeding farms are sometimes used with the goal of alleviating the pressure of harvesting or collecting on wild reptile populations. However, if not carefully regulated, breeding farms may be used to ‘launder’ illegally harvested reptiles, thereby allowing illegal trade to continue (Lyons & Natusch 2011).
To be included, ideally studies should have tested the impact of commercial breeding on wild populations, and this should be taken into account when considering the effectiveness of this action. However, often the effects on wild populations are not explicitly or directly tested.
For studies that assess the impact of releasing captive-bred or head-started reptiles into the wild, see Species management – Release captive-bred reptiles into the wild and Head-start wild-caught reptiles for release.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of commercially breeding reptiles to reduce pressure on wild populations. This study was in the Cayman Islands.

Human behaviour change (1 study): One study in the Cayman Islands found that where there was a commercial turtle farm, consumption and purchase of wild turtle products was rare, though some residents still showed a preference for wild turtle meat.
