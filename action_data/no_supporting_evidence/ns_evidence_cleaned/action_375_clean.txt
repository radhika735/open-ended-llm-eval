375: Control mammalian predators on islands for seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Seabirds frequently nest on the ground, where they are vulnerable to predation by cats Felis catus or pigs Sus scrofa, or in burrows where rats Rattus spp. or even house mice Mus musculus can predate chicks, eggs and adults. In addition, seabirds are often poor walkers (as they are specialised for flying and swimming) and cannot evade predators. Because of this, breeding sites are often confined to offshore islands and their populations can be devastated if predators are introduced.
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:

We found 16 before-and-after studies, one paired sites study and one literature review from around the world, all describing positive seabird responses to the removal or control of mammalian predators (mainly rats Rattus spp. and feral cats Felis catus) from islands.
Of these 18 studies, seven found either large population increases or recolonisations following predator eradication or control. Two of these found only partial population increases or recolonisations: a study from Alaska.
Twelve studies found increases in reproductive success and survival or decreases in predation and mortality following predator control. In one case there was also a small population increase.
Rats and mice Mus musculus were controlled in twelve studies, mostly examining burrow-nesting seabirds; cats in eight, mostly on ground or cliff-nesting seabirds; and other species in two.
