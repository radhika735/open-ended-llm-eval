476: Rehabilitation of injured and treated birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Relatively large and slow-reproducing species, such as raptors, can be badly affected by increases in adult mortality. Rehabilitating birds that have been injured may therefore be an important conservation action, particularly if it occurs on a large scale. In 1978, there were approximately 225 active wildlife or raptor rehabilitation programmes in the USA (Hamilton et al. 1988), showing that if they are effective, such programmes could make a real difference to bird populations.

Key Messages:

Two replicated studies from the USA and UK found that 40% and 25% of raptors were released following rehabilitation. The USA study also found that 32% of owls were released.
Three replicated studies from the USA all found relatively high survival of released raptors, with only 2.4% of birds being recovered (i.e. found dead, 1) and 66–68% survival over two weeks and six weeks. One study found that mortality rates were higher for owls than raptors.
