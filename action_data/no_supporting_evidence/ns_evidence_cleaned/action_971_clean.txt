971: Automatically reduce turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the use of automatic bat registration systems to monitor bat activity and shut down operation of wind turbines when bat activity reaches a predetermined ‘high’ level.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of automatically reducing turbine blade rotation when bat activity is high on bat populations. One study was in Germany, and one in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one randomized, controlled and one paired sites study) in Germany and the USA found that automatically reducing the rotation speed of wind turbine blades when bat activity is predicted to be high resulted in fewer bat fatalities for all bat species combined and for five bat species.
