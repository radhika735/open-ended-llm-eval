3577: Relocate reptiles (including eggs and hatchlings) following oil spills
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Relocating reptiles may be considered as a response of last resort following oil spills. Previous cases have involved moving thousands of sea turtle eggs or hatchlings (e.g. Safina 2011; Gaskill 2010), and as such great care should be taken when considering the potential risks and benefits that such large scale relocations may entail.
