1072: Ponto-Caspian gobies: Changing salinity
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Changing the salinity of an invaded waterbody may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of gobies, provided potentially negative effects on native species are managed carefully. Increasing the salinity to a very high level is likely to have significant effects on non-target species.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in Canada found 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours of exposure to water of 30% salinity.
