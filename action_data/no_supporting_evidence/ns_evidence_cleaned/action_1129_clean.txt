Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated pilot study in The Netherlands, found that hydrogen peroxide sprayed on potted floating pennywort plants resulted in curling and transparency of the leaves when applied at the highest tested concentration (30%), but this was still not sufficient to kill the plant.
