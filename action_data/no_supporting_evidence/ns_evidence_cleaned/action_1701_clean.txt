1701: Spread clippings
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Spreading clippings may help to increase the colonization of shrubland plants as a result of introducing seed. Plant clippings may also help to increase organic material in the soil.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that the addition of shoots and seeds of heathland plants did not increase the abundance of mature plants for half of plant species. One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that the frequency of heather plants was not significantly different in areas where heather clippings had been spread and areas where they were not spread.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found an increase in the number of heather seedlings, but not of other heathland species. One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that the addition of shoots and seeds increased the number of seedlings for a minority of species.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in South Africa found that plant cover and the number of plant species did not differ significantly between areas where branches had been spread and those where branches had not been spread.
