544: Provide supplementary food for gamebirds to increase adult survival
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Gamebirds are often raised for shooting, with food supplied to support captive-raised birds. However, this section only describes studies on wild and native birds, involving actions that a conservationist might perform.
 

Key Messages:

Two European studies found increased numbers of grey partridge Perdix perdix in fed areas, compared to unfed areas. In one study there was no change in the overall population in the study area, in the second there was an increase.
One cross-over study from the USA found that northern bobwhites Colinus virginianus had higher overwinter survival in fed areas, one found lower survival and a literature review found no overall effect of feeding.
