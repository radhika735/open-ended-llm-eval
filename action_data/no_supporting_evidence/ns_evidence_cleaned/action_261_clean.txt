261: Scare or otherwise deter birds from airports
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Collisions between birds and aircraft (‘birdstrikes’) at airports are potentially dangerous to planes, whilst also harming bird populations. Therefore making airports less attractive to birds, or scaring them off, has the potential for multiple benefits.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated studies in the UK and USA found that fewer birds (mainly gulls Larus spp.) used areas of long grass at airports. 
However, no data were provided on the effect of long grass on strike rates or mortality of birds.
