197: Control scrub on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Scrub on farmland can add complexity and heterogeneity to farmland. However, if scrub dominates non-productive land on farms it may lead to declines in species that require grassland and other farmland habitats.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the UK found a negative relationship between the number of young grey partridge Perdix perdix per adult and a combined intervention of scrub control, rough grazing and the restoration of various semi-natural habitats.
