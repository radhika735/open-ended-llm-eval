711: Encourage foraging waterfowl
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The primary goal of rice producers after the rice has been harvested is to remove rice straw (crop remains) over the winter fallow period, before preparations for the next growing season begin. In a bid to reduce air pollution in the region, farmers are now required to adopt alternative methods of reducing rice crop remains other than burning the rice straw. Many farmers now flood their land, providing winter habitat for waterfowl (in this case ducks). The ducks crush and tear at the rice crop remains while searching for insects and bits of grain.
 

Key Messages:
One controlled, replicated experiment from the USA found increased straw decomposition when ducks were allowed to forage.
SOIL TYPE COVERED: Silty clay
