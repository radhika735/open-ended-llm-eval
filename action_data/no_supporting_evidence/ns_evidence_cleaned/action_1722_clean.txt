1722: Increase number of livestock and use prescribed burning to control trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fire may damage or kill trees therefore reducing competition between trees and shrubland vegetation. Combining this with grazing may help to reduce regrowth and recruitment of young trees.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in ItalyÂ found that using prescribed burning and grazing to reduce tree cover reduced the cover of common heather and the basal area of trees. However, it did not alter the cover of purple moor grass.
