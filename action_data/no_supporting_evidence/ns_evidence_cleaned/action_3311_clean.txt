3311: Add below-ground organic matter before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section involves adding organic matter (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) below the ground surface (i.e. by mixing it into the sediment, or placing it into holes) to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation.
Organic matter could increase the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants, helping them to establish. Organic matter directly supplies nutrients to growing plants, supplies carbon and energy to soil organisms (which can indirectly increase nutrient availability), helps bind the soil together, retains water during dry periods, and mediates soil temperature (Donahue et al. 1983; Weil & Brady 2016). However, the soil organic matter content of wetland soils may be reduced by disturbance. For example, drainage allows oxygen into the soil, whilst reprofiling removes surface layers rich in organic matter (Bruland et al. 2006). Substances than can be used to add organic matter to wetland soils include compost, sewage sludge, wood chips and seaweed extract.
Note that many studies testing this action do not separate the effects of adding organic matter and disturbing the soil/sediment. We have included such studies, as well as those that do separate the effects of these actions with appropriate controls.
Related actions: Add below-ground organic matter, other than to complement planting; Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting; Add surface mulch to complement planting.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding below-ground organic matter to brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs. The study was in Brazil.

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a coastal swamp in Brazil reported that adding manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on their survival over three years, depending on the species of tree and dose of manure.
Growth (1 study): The same study reported that adding manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on their growth over three years, depending on the species of tree and dose of manure.
