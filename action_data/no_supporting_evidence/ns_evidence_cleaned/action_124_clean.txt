124: Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Planting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Farmland heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity (Benton et al. 2003) and so planting multiple crops in a single field may help increase its biological value.

Key Messages:

Three replicated, controlled and randomized studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK found that intercropping cabbage with French beans or clover resulted in increased ground beetle abundance.
A trial from Switzerland found increased earthworm abundance in a maize plot immediately followed by a rye grass crop.


A review found ground beetle numbers were enhanced by intercropping relative to single crops.
