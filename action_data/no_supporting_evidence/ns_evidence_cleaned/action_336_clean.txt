336: Remove midstorey from savannas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Conservationists may wish to remove shrubs from savanna if they are dominating the habitat and excluding some open-habitat species. However, shrubs can also provide habitat complexity and additional niches for species.
 

Key Messages:
A controlled study in Argentina found that in summer, but not overall, a control area had higher bird abundance and species richness than an area where shrubs were removed. There were also differences in community composition between treatments.
