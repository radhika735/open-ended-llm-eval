2264: Remove and relocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species before onset of impactful activities
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine biogenic habitats are habitats created by the occurrence of specific marine species, such as coral reefs, oyster reefs, mussel beds, or kelp forests (Jones et al. 1994). They form a new complex environment for other species to live in and can locally promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity. Many populations of marine biogenic species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including habitat damage or loss and direct physical damages from anthropogenic activities (Airoldi et al. 2009). As a pre-emptive conservation measure, biogenic species can potentially be temporarily removed to allow for an impactful activity to occur, then relocated back into their original location, or at a different location. Such measures have been trialled to preserve maërl habitat and its associated faunal community during the dredging of new shipping channels (Sheehan et al. 2015).
When this intervention is undertaken for species which do not form habitats, evidence has been summarised under “Species management – Remove and relocate invertebrate species before onset of impactful activities”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of removing and relocating habitat-forming species before onset of impactful activities on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Fal Estuary (UK).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Fal Estuary found that invertebrate community composition was different in plots where maërl bed habitat had been removed and relayed compared to undisturbed maërl after five weeks, but similar after 44 weeks.
Overall species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Fal Estuary found that invertebrate species richness was lower in plots where maërl bed habitat had been removed and relayed compared to undisturbed maërl after five weeks, but similar after 44 weeks.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the Fal Estuary found that invertebrate abundance was different in plots where maërl bed habitat had been removed and relayed compared to undisturbed maërl after five weeks, but similar after 44 weeks.
