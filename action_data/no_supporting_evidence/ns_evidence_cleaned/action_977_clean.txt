977: Install overpasses as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Overpasses (solid structures such as bridges built for pedestrians, vehicles or specifically for wildlife) may help to guide bats safely over roads or railways. This would both reduce the number of bats killed and increase the permeability of roads/railways for bats to maintain connectivity across the landscape. Studies have been summarised below if they provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control or the proportion of bats that are or are not using overpasses.
For evidence relating to bat gantries/bridges (wire or mesh structures), see ‘Install bat gantries or bat bridges as road/railway crossing structures for bats’.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of installing overpasses as road crossing structures for bats. Three studies were in Europe and one in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Australia found that the same number of bat species were recorded at an overpass and in nearby forest and bushland.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)      

Use (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one site comparison) in Ireland and France found that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses but up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations. One study in the UK found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, and an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats.
