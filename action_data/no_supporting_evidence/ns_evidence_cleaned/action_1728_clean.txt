1728: Disturb topsoil
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Disturbing soil reduces ground cover, allowing more light to reach the ground, as well as potentially bringing any shrubland seeds to the surface. This may help to increase the germination of the seeds of shrubland species.

Key Messages:

A controlled study in a former pine plantation in South Africa found that digging soil did not alter vegetation cover or the density of native plants.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance increased the abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species.
