850: Retain buffer zones around core habitat
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Retaining areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation around core habitats can help to protect the habitat and wildlife that it supports from the detrimental effects of habitat loss or disturbance.
Studies that investigated retaining buffer zones within harvested forests are discussed in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Logging & wood harvesting – Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest’. Buffer zones provided by excluding livestock from water bodies are discussed in ‘Threat: Agriculture – Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’ and those created by planting are described in ‘Threat: Pollution – Agricultural pollution – Plant riparian buffer strips’.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Australia found that grassland restoration that included leaving unmown buffers around ponds increased numbers of frog species.
One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that retaining buffers along ridge tops within harvested forest increased Red Hills salamander abundance, body condition and genetic diversity. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that retaining unmown buffers around ponds had mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass depending on species and site.
One replicated study in the USA found that 30 m buffer zones around wetlands were not sufficient to protect marbled salamanders.
