1116: Asian clams: Change temperature of the water
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
All organisms will have an upper thermal tolerance and so raising water temperatures may offer a tool for management of Asian clams Corbicula spp. Such an approach may be especially suited to industrial facilities that generate an excess of heated water, such as power plants. Reducing water temperatures can also offer a possible management tool. Studies in the St. Clair River, USA reported very large winter die-offs of Corbicula fluminea (French & Schloesser 1996). Populations persisted in the waters immediately downstream of a power plant in which water temperature was relatively high.

Key Messages:

A controlled laboratory study in the USA found that temperatures of 36°C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days.
