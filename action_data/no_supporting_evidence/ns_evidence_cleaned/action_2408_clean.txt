2408: Reduce intensity of grazing by domestic livestock
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Overgrazing is responsible for the degradation of habitats across the world, being especially damaging in arid environments, where the removal of vegetation can quickly lead to soil erosion. Reducing grazing intensity may reduce the damage to vegetation and can also help reduce disturbance to mammals and accidental loss of nests of small mammal species.

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies evaluated the effects on mammals of reducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock. Six studies were in the USA, six were in Europe and one was in China.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three site comparison or controlled studies, in the USA and Norway, found that reduced livestock grazing intensity was associated with increased species richness of small mammals whilst one study did not find an increase in species richness.

POPULATION RESPONSE (13 STUDIES)

Abundance (13 studies): Six of nine site comparison or controlled studies (including seven replicated studies), in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands and Norway, found that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances (or proxies of abundances) of small mammals, whilst two studies showed no significant impact of reducing grazing intensity and one study showed mixed results for different species. Two replicated studies (including one controlled and one site comparison study), in the UK and in a range of European countries, found that reducing grazing intensity did not increase numbers of Irish hares or European hares. A controlled, before-and-after study, in the USA found that exclusion of cattle grazing was associated with higher numbers of elk and mule deer. A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that an absence of cattle grazing was associated with higher numbers of North American beavers.
