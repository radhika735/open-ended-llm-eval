1703: Plant turf
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cutting turf from an intact shrubland and planting it at a degraded site effectively transplants part of one shrubland to another one. This intervention may almost instantly restore shrubland habitat in some areas of a site, and over time may allow for the colonization of a site by shrubland plants.

Key Messages:

Two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that planting turf from intact heathland sites increased the abundance or cover of heathland species. One of these studies also found that planting turf increased the seedling abundance for a majority of heathland plant species.
One randomized, controlled study in the UK found that planting turf increased forb cover, and reduced grass cover.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in Iceland found that planting large turves from intact heathland sites increased the number of plant species, but smaller turves did not.
