1115: Asian clams: Change salinity of the water
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Elevated levels of salt in the water can cause osmotic stress in Asian clams Corbicula spp., leading to mortality. Increasing the salinity of a waterbody to a very high level is likely to have significant effects on non-target species.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated laboratory study conducted in the USA found that Asian clams were killed (100% mortality) when exposed to high salinities (18-34‰).
