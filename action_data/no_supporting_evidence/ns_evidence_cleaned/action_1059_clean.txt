1059: Red-eared terrapin:  Application of a biocide 
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Biocides such as glyphosate may negatively impact red-eared terrapin Trachemys scripta populations, by reducing hatching success of the eggs of breeding populations.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled laboratory study in the USA, found that application of glyphosate to the eggs of red-eared terrapins reduced hatching success to 73%, but only at the highest experimental concentration of glyphosate and a surface active agent.
