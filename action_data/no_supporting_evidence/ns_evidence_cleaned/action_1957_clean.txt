1957: Apply textured coating to turbines
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that smooth surfaces, such as those found on wind turbine towers, may be misidentified by bats as water or clear flight paths due to their acoustic mirror properties (Russo et al. 2012, McAlexander 2013, Greif et al. 2017). Applying a textured coating could reduce bat collisions and fatalities. Behavioural experiments in flight rooms found that bats did not make contact with textured surfaces and approached them less often than smooth surfaces (Greif & Siemers 2010, Bienz 2015).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of applying a textured coating to turbines on bat populations. The study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One paired sites study in the USA found that applying a textured coating to a turbine did not reduce the activity of four bat species or the number of bats observed.
