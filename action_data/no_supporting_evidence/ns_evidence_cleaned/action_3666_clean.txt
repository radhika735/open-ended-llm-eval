3666: Alter water flow rates 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Changes to natural stream flows, for example channelization, may negatively impact reptiles due to faster moving water (Bodie 2001), and changes in summer flow rates may alter the time available for nesting, impact the timing of hatching and affect survival rates (Lenhart et al. 2013). Interventions aimed at recovering natural flows, for example by removing the structures causing channelization and increasing flow rates or providing areas that have varied flow rates may address this threat.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of altering water flow rates on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that releasing a large flow of water into a wetland system had mixed effects on relative abundance of eastern long-necked turtles and the number of turtles caught.
Condition (1 study): One before-and-after study in Australia found that after releasing a large flow of water into a wetland system, body condition of eastern long-necked turtles improved.
