311: Provide paths to limit the extent of disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Studies have shown that visitors keep to paths when they are provided, thereby reducing disturbance to the wider habitat without the need for specific access restrictions (e.g. Pearce-Higgins & Yalden 1997).
Pearce-Higgins, J.W. & Yalden, D.W. (1997) The effect of resurfacing the Pennine Way on recreational use of blanket bog in the Peak District National Park, England. Biological Conservation, 82, 337–343.
 
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study from the UK found that two species of wader nested closer to a path, or at higher densities near the path, following resurfacing, which resulted in far fewer people leaving the path.
