1864: Amphibians: Vary enclosure temperature to simulate seasonal changes in the wild
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
For some species, breeding is seasonal and can be triggered by longer periods of sunlight, changing temperatures or increased/decreased rainfall. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.

Key Messages:

One small, replicated study in Italy found that one of six females bred following a drop in temperature from 20-24 to 17°C, and filling of an egg laying pond.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia that provided a pre-breeding cooling period, alongside allowing females to gain weight before the breeding period, separating sexes during the non-breeding period, providing mate choice for females and playing recorded mating calls, increased breeding success.
