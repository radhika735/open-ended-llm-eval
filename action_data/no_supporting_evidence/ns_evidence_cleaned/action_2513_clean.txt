2513: Drive wild animals away using domestic animals of the same species to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Domestic mammals may be used in attempts to repel wild mammals of the same species that are causing nuisance, such as be crop-raiding. This intervention is likely to be especially relevant where the wild animal presents a potential threat to people such that simply chasing animals away may not always be a viable or effective option. If the intervention is effective, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of the focal species.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using domestic animals to drive away wild mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in India.
