1494: Avoid/minimize logging of important food tree species for primates
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to reduce the impact of selective logging on primates by avoiding/minimizing the removal of tree species that represent important food sources to primates.
            The avoidance of slashing climbers or lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation is discussed under ‘Avoid slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation’.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased over 13 years after trees important for food for the species were preserved, alongside other interventions.
