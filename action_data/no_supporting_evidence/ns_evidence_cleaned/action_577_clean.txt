577: Translocate woodpeckers
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis are a vulnerable species from the southeast USA. They are subject to intense management practices including forest manipulations (see ‘Natural system modifications’) and competitor control (‘Invasive and other problematic species’). Red-cockaded woodpeckers live in small family groups, normally with a single breeding pair. These groups occupy small ‘clusters’ of trees and can become increasingly isolated if populations decline.
Translocating birds between groups and into new areas therefore represents a potential method of maintaining a viable population structure. Pine stands can be specifically managed for woodpeckers to create unoccupied clusters, into which translocated birds can be released.
 

Key Messages:

All five translocation programmes studied were for red-cockaded woodpeckers Picoides borealis in the southern USA.
Six studies of four programmes found that &gt;50% of translocated birds remained in their new sites, with two studies of the same programme reporting a large population increase.
Birds from four programmes were reported as forming pairs or breeding, although some translocated pairs split up and some translocated nestlings were abandoned.
One study found that translocated nestlings fledged at similar rates to native chicks.
