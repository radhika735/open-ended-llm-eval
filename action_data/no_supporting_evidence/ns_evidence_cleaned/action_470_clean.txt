470: Use flashing lights to reduce mortality from artificial lights
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Flashing lights may prove less attractive to birds but remain equally visible to humans, making them suitable for warning lights, on communications towers or similar.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled trial from the USA found that fewer dead birds were found beneath control towers that used only flashing lights, as opposed to those using both flashing and continuous lights.
