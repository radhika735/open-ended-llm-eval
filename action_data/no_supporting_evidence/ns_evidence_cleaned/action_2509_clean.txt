2509: Use repellents that taste bad (‘contact repellents’) to deter crop or property damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention considers specifically studies that assess effectiveness of repellents that are intended to be distasteful to wild mammals. Although some may produce some element of repellent odour, the main effect is generally when they are tasted, such as through licking or biting off vegetation to which it has been applied. Included here are tests of several repellents that are marketed commercially, especially to reduce browsing by herbivores on planted trees. The intervention also covers use of these repellents to deter damage to property.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects of using repellents that taste bad (‘contact repellents’) to deter crop or property damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Nine studies were in the USA, two were in the UK and one was in Italy.

OTHER (12 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (12 studies): Five of 11 controlled studies (including 10 replicated studies), in the USA, Italy and the UK, of a range of contact repellents, found that they reduced herbivory or consumption of baits. The other six studies reported mixed results with at least some repellents at some concentrations deterring herbivory, sometimes for limited periods. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that a repellent did not prevent chewing damage by coyotes.
