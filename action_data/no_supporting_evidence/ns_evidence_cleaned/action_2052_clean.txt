2052: Manage microclimate of artificial bat roosts
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The microclimate of artificial roosts may be managed to ensure that conditions remain suitable for roosting bats.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of managing the microclimate of artificial bat roosts on bat populations. Two studies were in the UK and one in Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in Spain found more bats in two artificial roosts within buildings after they had been modified to reduce internal roost temperatures.

BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that heated bat boxes were used by common pipistrelle bats at one of seven sites, but none were used by maternity colonies. One replicated study in the UK found that none of the 12 heated bat boxes installed within churches were used by displaced Natterer’s bats.
