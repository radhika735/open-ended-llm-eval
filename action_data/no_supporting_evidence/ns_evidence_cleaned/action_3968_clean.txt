3968: Raise cutting height on grasslands 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
In productive grasslands, cutting or mowing is used to harvest vegetation, such as for hay or silage, but the harvest causes a sudden loss of habitat structure and resources used by butterflies and moths. It may also kill or injure eggs or caterpillars living within the sward (Humbert et al. 2010). Raising the cutting height by a few centimetres may allow more individuals to survive underneath the mower, or leave more resources available.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of raising cutting height on grasslands. One study was in each of the UK and Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar species richness of butterflies to plots cut to 5 cm.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm in May and July had a similar abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland found that the survival of large white caterpillars in grassland plots cut to 9 cm was similar to in plots cut to 6 cm2.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Switzerland found that a similar proportion of wax model caterpillars were damaged when meadows were cut to 9 cm or 6 cm.
