2466: Airborne translocation of mammals using parachutes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Translocating animals into remote terrain can be logistically challenging. Holding animals for several days while moving across ground can cause them stress and, potentially, illness or mortality. Dropping animals from an airplane means that they can be held captive for shorter periods, though it may be harder to choose the precise release location. Parachutes, combined with a container that opens upon landing, can be used in aerial drops.
