2649: Apply fertilizer to trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) are frequently applied to newly planted or regenerating trees. They increase soil fertility and may, therefore, enhance tree growth and nutritional content of foliage available to browsing herbivores. This could increase use of such areas by herbivores, leading to enhanced survival or abundance of these species.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of applying fertilizer to trees. All three studies were in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): One of three replicated studies (including one controlled study and two site comparison studies), in Canada, found that thinned forest stands to which fertilizer was applied were used more by snowshoe hares in winter but not in summer over the short-term. The other studies found that forest stands to which fertilizer was applied were not more used by snowshoe hares in the longer term or by mule deer or moose.
