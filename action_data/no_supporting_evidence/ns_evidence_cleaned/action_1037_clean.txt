1037: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Create barriers
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Physical barriers have the potential to prevent the spread of invasive crayfish, especially upstream within rivers. A review  reported that building physical barriers was an effective mechanism to halt, or at least delay, the natural movement of red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Stebbing et al. 2012). However, a before-and-after study (Hänfling et al. 2011) found that an erected barrier in the River Buaa at the border between Sweden and Norway did not prevent the migration of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus into the Norwegian part of the river.

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Spain found that the use of concrete dams across a stream, specifically designed with features to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them, were effective at containing spread of the population upstream.
