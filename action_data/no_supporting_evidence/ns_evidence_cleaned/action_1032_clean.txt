1032: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Sterilization of males
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Sterilisation of males which are allowed to remain in wild populations can help to reduce the rate of population increase.  For example, a review study from the UK (Stebbing et al. 2012) reported that removal of pleopods used by males to deposit spermatophores onto the females led to a population decrease over a three year period.

Key Messages:

One replicated laboratory study in Italy found that exposing male red swamp crayfish to X-rays reduced the number of offspring they produced by 43%.
