3920: Grow native trees within perennial crop plantations 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Perennial crops, such as coffee, chocolate, oil palm and vines, are planted and left in place for many years, with harvest taking place from mature plants. Many of these species are grown both within and outside their native ranges, but in all cases are often farmed in monocultures. However, it is possible to allow or encourage other plant species to grow among perennial crops, which may provide benefits in terms of natural pest control or disease resistance, as well as allowing native animals, including butterflies and moths, to persist among the crop.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of growing native trees within perennial crop plantations. This study was in Costa Rica.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that coffee farms with a native and a non-native tree species growing within them had a higher diversity of butterflies than coffee farms with a single non-native tree species, but a similar diversity to coffee farms with two non-native tree species. The same study found a similar species richness of butterflies on all farms.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Costa Rica found that coffee farms with a native and a non-native tree species growing within them had a similar abundance of butterflies to coffee farms with one or two non-native tree species.
