1554: Implement continuous health monitoring with permanent vet on site
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the continuous health monitoring of primates by vets who are permanently based on site. There are only few organizations that provide in situ veterinary treatment for wild animals (e.g. Robbins et al. 2011). The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Program, for example, intervenes in cases of human-induced illnesses, such as injuries incurred by snares or respiratory disease, as well as when the life of an individual is at risk and there is the chance that the illness can spread to other individuals.

Key Messages:

One controlled, before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that the population size of mountain gorillas that were continuously monitored by vets, alongside other interventions, increased by 168% over 41 years.
