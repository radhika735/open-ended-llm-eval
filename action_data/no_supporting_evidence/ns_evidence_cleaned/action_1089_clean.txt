1089: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Exposure to parasites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Parasites have the potential to control gammarid populations by reducing production of offspring, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death. In the wild, parasite infections have been associated with rapid die-offs of natural populations of freshwater shrimps, with the invasive species being more vulnerable than native species (Kestrup et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

A replicated, laboratory study in Canada found that an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp.
