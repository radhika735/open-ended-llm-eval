3941: Create young plantations within mature woodland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Although many species of butterflies and moths live within woodland, many are reliant upon open areas with a diverse habitat structure, which are sheltered by the surrounding trees. Traditional woodland management, such as small scale wood harvesting, which created these habitats has declined, leading to the closure of woodland canopies (Bubová et al. 2015). Creating young plantations within mature woodland may help to temporarily open up patches within the forest, and create new habitat for butterflies and moths by encouraging the growth of food plants on the woodland floor, or by creating sheltered, sunny sites for basking and territory defence.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of creating young plantations within mature woodland. This study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
 
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary populations were more likely to persist for up to 20 years in woodlands with larger areas of young plantations (or coppicing) than in mature coniferous (both species) or deciduous (pearl-bordered fritillary only) woodland.
