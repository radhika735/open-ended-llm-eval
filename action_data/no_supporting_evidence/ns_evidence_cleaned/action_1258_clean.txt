1258: Add organic matter after tree planting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding wood residuals to the ground increases soil nutrient content and soil moisture. It can also stimulate increases in microbial populations that can stabilize the soil structure. That may help the establishment of planted trees.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding leaf litter or wood-chips before restoration planting increased seedling biomass, but decreased seedling emergence and survival.
