209: Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Planting more than one crop in each field increases habitat heterogeneity at a smaller scale than increasing crop diversity at a landscape scale (see ‘Increase crop diversity’). Heterogeneity is thought to be key for increasing farmland biodiversity and so planting multiple crops may help birds of different functional groups to use a single field.
 

Key Messages:
A study from the USA found that 35 species of bird used fields with intercropping, with four nesting, but that productivity from the fields was very low.
