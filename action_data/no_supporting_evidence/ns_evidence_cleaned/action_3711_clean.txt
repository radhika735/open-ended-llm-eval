3711: Manage vegetation using livestock grazing 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Using grazing to manage vegetation can limit succession that would otherwise lead to an increase in woody plant species and may create microhabitat diversity through trampling. This may help to increase the abundance of reptile species that depend on early-succession and diverse habitats.
Here we present studies that use grazing to target both native and non-native species.
For studies discussing the impacts of different grazing regimes in agricultural environments, see Threat: Agriculture – manage grazing regime: Wetlands and Forest, open woodland & savanna and Threat: agriculture – cease livestock grazing.
For studies discussing the effects of managing vegetation by cutting, using herbicide or by hand, see Manage vegetation by cutting or mowing; Manage vegetation using herbicides and Manage vegetation by hand (selective weeding).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of managing vegetation using livestock grazing on reptile populations. One study was in France and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in France found that one reptile species was more abundant in areas grazed by sheep than in areas managed by burning, whereas the abundance of five other species was similar in all areas.
Reproductive success (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that after grazing cattle to restore bog turtle habitat, along with providing artificial nest covers, more bog turtle eggs were laid and hatching success was higher than before.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that bog turtle nests were laid only in areas that had been grazed in the current or previous growing season.
