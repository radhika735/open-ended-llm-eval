3546: Limit or prohibit specific fishing methods 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact reptiles by catching individuals unintentionally or causing injury or death through entanglements in fishing gear. Applying restrictions to the use of specific fishing methods (which may include ‘static’ methods such as using lobster/crab pots and traps, or ‘mobile’ methods such as gill nets or trawl nets) in locations or seasons when reptiles are particularly vulnerable to capture may alleviate these threats.
For other studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting fishing see Cease or prohibit all types of fishing and Cease or prohibit commercial fishing. For studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting fishing at certain times see Establish temporary fishery closures.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of limiting or prohibiting specific fishing methods on reptile populations. This study was in Brazil.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Brazil found that in areas where a fishing agreement was implemented that involved limiting the use of gill nets along with a wider suit of measures had more river turtles than areas that did not implement the agreement.
