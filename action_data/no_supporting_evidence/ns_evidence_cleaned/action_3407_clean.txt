3407: Sow seeds at start of growing season
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Grassland seeds are commonly sown in autumn or spring in restoration projects in temperate regions. Sowing in autumn may result in early germination of plants allowing them to become established before other non-grassland species. However, sowing in autumn may also result in more seeds dying as a result of waterlogging in winter and so, in some cases, spring sowing may produce better results.

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of sowing seeds at the start of the growing season on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one was in the UK.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (2 STUDIES)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds in spring increased plant diversity compared to sowing in autumn.
Sown/planted richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing seeds in spring increased the number of sown species compared to sowing in autumn.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)

Sown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing seeds in spring increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to sowing in autumn.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (1 STUDY) 

Germination/Emergence (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds in spring led to similar emergence of forb seedlings compared to sowing in winter.
