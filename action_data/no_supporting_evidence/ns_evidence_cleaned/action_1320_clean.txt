1320: Primates: Present food in water (including dishes and ponds)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Food should be presented to primates in a way that encourages their natural food finding behaviour. Introducing new textures stimulates  curiosity and interest, with the aim of increasing their activity and foraging behaviours as well as their use of tools to extract the food from the water.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that when exposed to water-filled troughs, monkeys were more active and increased their use of tools.
