2774: Replace or repair damaged anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Anti-predator nets may be placed around fish pens and cages to physically exclude marine or freshwater mammals to reduce predation and human-wildlife conflict. However, such nets may entangle mammals causing injury or death.  Frequently replacing or repairing anti-predator nets may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled within holes or loose sections of damaged nets (Kemper et al. 2003). This may also prevent mammals from breaching the nets thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.
For studies that involve modifying anti-predator nets, see Modify anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of replacing anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems. The study was in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA).

Human-wildlife conflict (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation.
