Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Raking can be used to reduce the length of grass as well as pulling out individual plants. In addition, it may create disturbances to topsoil allowing shrubland species to establish.

Key Messages:

A randomized, replicated, controlled, paired study in the USAÂ found that cover of both invasive and native grasses, as well as forbs was lower in areas that were raked than in areas that were not raked, but that the number of annual plants species did not differ.
