2535: Modify traps used in the control/eradication of non-native species to avoid injury of non-target mammal 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A range of live-trapping techniques is used in control activities aimed at non-native species. As traps may capture species additional to the targeted non-native species, using live traps enables release of those non-target captures. However, restrained mammals are at risk of suffering injuries prior to being released. This intervention considers cases where modifications might be made to live traps with the intention of reducing such incidental injuries.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of modifying traps used in the control or eradication of non-native species to avoid injury of non-target mammals. This study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Condition (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that modifying traps used for catching non-native mammals reduced moderate but not severe injuries among incidentally captured San Nicolas Island foxes.
