3861: Retain or plant trees to act as windbreaks 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Even under normal weather conditions many species of butterfly and moth, particularly those which are weak fliers, show a preference for sheltered areas (Hayes et al. 2018). However, during extreme weather events, high winds are a particular problem as they prevent adults from being able to fly, and therefore potentially find food, defend territories, or mate. Retaining or planting trees, which act as wind breaks, may enable butterflies and moths to maintain activity during higher winds, reducing the impact of extreme weather events resulting from climate change.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of retaining or planting trees to act as windbreaks. This study was in Sweden.

Use (1 study): One site comparison study in Sweden reported that sheltered grassland strips were more likely to be used by one of four butterfly species than strips providing nectar resources or no resources.
