783: Change mowing regime
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many amphibians require damp terrestrial habitat once they move out of water. If vegetation surrounding water bodies is mown very short, it will not retain sufficient humidity or provide cover for amphibians during their terrestrial stages. Cutting can also disturb amphibians.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Australia found that restoration that included reduced mowing increased numbers of frog species.
