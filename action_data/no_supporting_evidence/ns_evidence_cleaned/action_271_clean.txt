271: Use legislative regulation to protect wild populations
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Perhaps the most commonly used intervention in response to declining species is to provide legal protection for the species. This alone may be enough to protect a species or population, but if not, de facto or ‘on-the-ground’ protection may also be required to ensure people abide by the law.
 

Key Messages:

Six out of seven before-and-after studies and two literature reviews/meta-analyses found evidence that legislation protects bird populations. 
Five studies in Europe, Indonesia and across the world found increased population levels of vultures, raptors, cranes and cockatoos following protective legislation (amongst other interventions). However, one found populations of raptors declined soon after. The literature review also found two cases of limited or no impact of legislation.
Two before-and-after studies from Denmark and the USA and Canada and the meta-analysis found increased estimated survival of falcons, ducks and parrots with stricter protection, but not necessarily population-level responses.
A meta-analysis found decreased harvest of parrots in areas with stricter protection regimes, but a before-and-after study found no evidence for reduced shearwater harvest with legislation.
