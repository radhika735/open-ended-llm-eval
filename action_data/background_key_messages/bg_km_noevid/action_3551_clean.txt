Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Limiting the length of fishing gear (e.g. ropes, lines, nets) or the number of traps in an area may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch(‘bycatch’) of aquatic reptiles. This could involve using shorter ropes or lines, or using multiple pots, traps or nets on each line.
