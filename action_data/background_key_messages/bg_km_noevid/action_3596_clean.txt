3596: Regulate artificial lighting during vulnerable periods
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial lighting may have a negative impact on a range of reptile species (Perry & Fisher 2006). Seasonal reduction of lighting to coincide with vulnerable periods, such as turtle breeding times, has been suggested as a conservation intervention, although, in practice, public safety considerations may often preclude action (Bertolotti & Salmon, 2015).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of regulating artificial lighting during vulnerable periods.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
