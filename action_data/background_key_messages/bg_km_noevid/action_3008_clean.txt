3008: Change season/timing of vegetation harvest: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The effects of harvesting vegetation – especially on its physical structure at a given time of year – may vary depending on the time of year it is carried out. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should have compared a fixed harvest frequency and intensity, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of plants cut every summer vs 100% of plants cut every other summer).
Related actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest; Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of harvesting brackish/saline swamps in different seasons or at different times.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
