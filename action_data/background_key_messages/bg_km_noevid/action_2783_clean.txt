Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be hunted for their perceived medicinal properties (Alves et al. 2012). Introducing alternative treatments and dispelling myths about the health benefits of using marine and freshwater mammal products as medicine may reduce hunting pressure.
