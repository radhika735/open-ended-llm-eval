3140: Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Although invertebrates such as insects, spiders, crabs and molluscs are an important part of marsh and swamp ecosystems, they can become problematic where they are introduced and/or become abundant. Invertebrates could be excluded from vegetation patches using mesh cages, or from individual plants using sticky materials painted on to stems.
We have not summarized the numerous fundamental studies testing the effects of invertebrate exclusion or removal on existing marsh or swamp vegetation: it is not clear that such small-scale manipulations are realistic practical conservation interventions. Many of these studies have demonstrated substantial effects, both direct and indirect, of invertebrates on vegetation (e.g. Tyrell et al. 2008; Bertness et al. 2014).
Related interventions: Exclude wild vertebrates using physical barriers (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically excluding wild invertebrates from marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
