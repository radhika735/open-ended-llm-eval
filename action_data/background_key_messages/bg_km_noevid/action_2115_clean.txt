2115: Eliminate fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Overfishing is thought to be encouraged by fisheries subsidies, which provides funds that go towards building boats, and paying for fuel and fishing gear. By eliminating fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing (Sumaila & Pauly 2007) fishing effort can be reduced in an area, thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of eliminating fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
