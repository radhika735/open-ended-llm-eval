3570: Create walls or barriers to exclude pollutants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Barriers may be used to prevent pollutants from entering waterways. Examples of such pollutants include garbage, sediments, oil, grease, excess nutrients, organic waste matter, pesticides and fertilisers. A range of options for both temporary and permanent structures have been suggested, including silt fences and gabions (Botting & Bellette 1998). Barriers that excluded pollutants could have positive effects on wild reptile populations.
