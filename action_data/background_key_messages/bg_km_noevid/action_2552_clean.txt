2552: Protect habitat along elevational gradients
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Global warming is prompting poleward and uphill shifts in species’ range (e.g. Chen et al. 2011, Myers et al. 2009, Rowe et al. 2010). Species reliant on particular habitats may suffer population declines if they are unable to move towards higher latitudes and if there is no suitable habitat available at higher altitudes. Protecting habitat along elevational gradients may help to enable shifts in range.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of protecting habitat along elevational gradients.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
