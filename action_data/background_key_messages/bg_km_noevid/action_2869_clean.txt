2869: Use double hulls to prevent oil spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can cause serious harm to marine and freshwater mammals (Helm et al. 2014). Double hulls, where the bottom and sides of ships have two layers of watertight surfaces, can be used to prevent oil spills and have been required in some countries since the 1990s (Alcock 1992). Double hulls can reduce vessel damage to tankers when involved in accidents, and their use has been shown to significantly reduce the number of accidental oil spills (Glen 2010, Yip et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using double hulls to prevent oil spills on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
