1570: Parrot’s feather: Mechanical excavation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mechanical excavation can be used for digging sediment-rooted plants such as parrot’s feather. Harvesting and digging using excavators, while not species-specific, can achieve considerable reduction of rooted floating-leaved, submerged and emergent plants in narrow waterbodies such as ponds, channels and small rivers (Hussner et al. 2017). The interventions ‘Mechanical harvesting or cutting’ discusses the mechanical harvesting or cutting of parrot’s feather. The use of water-jet ventilation and suction dredging are respectively discussed in ‘Removal using water jets’ and ‘Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal’. The use of manual harvesting to control parrot’s feather is discussed in ‘Manual harvesting (hand-weeding)’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of mechanical excavation to control parrot’s feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
