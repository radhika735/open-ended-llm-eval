2741: Use citizen surveillance to report illegal fishing
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws. Compliance with these measures is important to protect commercially targeted and non-targeted species and their habitats: non-compliance has been shown to have a negative impact on the biomass of targeted species in no-take marine reserves (Bergseth et al. 2015). One way to improve compliance and help enforce regulations may be to ask citizens/the wider public (as opposed to government/state or scientific organisations) to provide surveillance or information on fishing activity. In practice, this may be via the provision of a dedicated system for reporting illegal activity (e.g. a telephone hotline).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using citizen surveillance to report illegal fishing on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
