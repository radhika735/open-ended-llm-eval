1340: Primates: Provide access to food at all times (day and night)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Different species of primates show huge variation in their natural diets with some wild animals spending a considerable amount of time foraging for food (up to 70%), this could be during the day or at night. In captivity food needs to be offered in a manner and frequency appropriate to the species, to provide variety, with the aim of promoting the foraging and social feeding behaviour seen in the wild.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of providing primates access to food at all times (day and night).
