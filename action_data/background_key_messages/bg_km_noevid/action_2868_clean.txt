2868: Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some sewer systems collect rainwater runoff, sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe, where it is then transported to a sewage treatment plant. During heavy rainfall events or snow melt, the volume of wastewater can exceed the capacity of treatment facilities. In such instances, sewer systems can overflow and discharge untreated storm water and wastewater directly into rivers and seas (Moffa 1997). Untreated wastewater reaching aquatic environments may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria and viruses, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting the amount of untreated storm and wastewaters overflowing, for instance by increasing the capacity of treatment facilities, may reduce pollution levels and associated risks to marine and freshwater mammals.
For an intervention related to reducing litter in stormwater, see Install stormwater traps or grids.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the amount of storm wastewater overflow on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
