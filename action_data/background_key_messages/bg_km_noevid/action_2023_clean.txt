2023: Install sound barriers in proximity to bat roosts and habitats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sound barriers such as fences, walls or embankments may be installed in proximity to bat roosts and habitats to reduce noise levels. Specially designed barriers that reflect or absorb sound are available. A buffer of trees and vegetation may also be used.
For an intervention that aims to reduce noise disturbance within buildings see ‘Install sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and areas occupied by humans within developments’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of installing sound barriers in proximity to bat roosts and habitats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
