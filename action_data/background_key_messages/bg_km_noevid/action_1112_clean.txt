1112: Asian clams: Exposure to disease-causing organisms
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disease-causing organisms have the potential to control Asian clam Corbicula spp. populations by reducing reproductive outputs, increasing risk of predation, slowing growth rates or causing death. Studies in Asian clams have focussed on their use as a tool for monitoring water-borne pathogens of interest to humans, rather than identifying pathogens that may regulate clam populations.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the use of exposure to disease-causing organisms for the control of Asian clams.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
