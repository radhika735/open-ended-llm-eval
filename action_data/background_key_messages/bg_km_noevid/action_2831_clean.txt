2831: Introduce legislation to prohibit or restrict the use of fishing gear types or methods that are harmful to mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves introducing legislation to prohibit or restrict the use of fishing gear types or methods that have a high risk of injuring or killing marine and freshwater mammals, e.g. by entanglement or incidental capture. For example, large-scale pelagic drift nets were banned in international waters by a United Nations resolution adopted in 1992 due to high levels of bycatch of cetaceans and other taxa (United Nations General Assembly 1990). Enforcement may be required if compliance is low. See Enforce legislation to control illegal fishing using gear or methods that are harmful to mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of introducing legislation to prohibit or restrict the use of fishing gear types or methods that are harmful to mammals on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
