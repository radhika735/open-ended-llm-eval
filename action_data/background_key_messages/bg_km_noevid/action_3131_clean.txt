3131: Introduce organisms to control problematic plants: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves biological control: managing the abundance or distribution of problematic organisms via their enemies. Enemies of problematic plants could be disease-causing microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects, fish or even other plants (to compete with or parasitize problematic plants). Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002). Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016), and could damage non-target plants or restrict their establishment (Iannone & Galatowitsch 2008). Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have successfully introduced a biocontrol agent that persisted in the environment. The agent must have been introduced with a clear aim to control problematic plants.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing organisms (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants in brackish/saline swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
