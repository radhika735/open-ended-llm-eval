3484: Provide training for construction workers on the potential risks to reptiles and how to mitigate disturbance during works
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Training construction workers to recognise potential risks to wildlife during the construction process (e.g. which areas may be important habitat within and adjacent to construction sites) and best practices to mitigate disturbance during construction (e.g. minimising compacting or disturbing the ground within the construction area) or enhance habitat during construction (e.g. taking advantage of surplus woody debris, rocks, gravel and displaced soil to optimise available habitat) may reduce the impacts of development activities (Ovaska et al. 2014).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of providing training for construction workers on the potential risks to reptiles and how to mitigate disturbance during works.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
