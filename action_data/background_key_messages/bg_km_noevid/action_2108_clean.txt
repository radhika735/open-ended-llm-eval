2108: Limit the number of fishing days
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). The number of fishing days could be limited to reduce fishing effort in an area, thereby reducing the threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates, and may allow time for them to potentially recover during the non-fishing days.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of fishing days on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
