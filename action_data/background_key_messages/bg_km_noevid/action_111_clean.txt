111: Manage wild deer numbers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves controlling numbers of wild deer on farmland. Wild deer populations can cause damage to woodlands, crops and other wildlife habitats through browsing and bark stripping. The introduction of non-native deer species to the UK and a lack of predators to naturally control deer populations mean that management of deer numbers may be required to prevent damage to farmland habitats (Mayle 1999).
