1459: Reduce road widths
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
 It is likely that narrower roads are safer for primates to cross without injury compared to wider roads that they have to spend more time on. A study investigating the barrier effect of roads on the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and common shrew Sorex araneus found that species crossed narrow roads more often than wide roads (Rico et al. 2007). Therefore, reducing road width may help preserve habitat connectivity and prevent or reduce primate-vehicle collisions.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of reducing road widths on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
