2878: Reduce the amount of antibiotics used in aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Antibiotics are used in aquaculture to reduce or eliminate harmful bacteria. However, some antibiotics have been shown to accumulate and persist in aquatic environments, with potential negative effects on marine and freshwater mammals. The risks associated with the use of antibiotics may be reduced by applying them in smaller doses, less frequently or across a smaller area. In addition, research has shown that alternatives to antibiotics can be used successfully in aquaculture (Defoirdt et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing the amount of antibiotics used in aquaculture systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
