1056: Red-eared terrapin:  Biological control using native predators
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A study in the USA provided a strong indication that racoons feed on adult red-eared terrapins Trachemys scripta in their native range, with female terrapins smaller than 200mm in plastron length at particularly high risk (Tucker et al. 1999).
Although hatchlings of red-eared terrapins could conceivably be eaten by a few native UK species including otters (e.g. European otter Lutra lutra), herons (e.g. grey heron Ardea cinerea), rodents or corvids, or even introduced species like the American mink Neovison vison, once adult this species would have few natural enemies in the UK (Bringsøe 2006; Wilkinson 2012).
Successful reproduction of red-eared terrapins has not been recorded in the UK (Scalera 2006).  As native UK predators are unlikely to be large enough to eat adult terrapins it is unlikely that population control using natural predators could deliver a control mechanism for UK populations.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the use of predators to control invasive terrapin populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
