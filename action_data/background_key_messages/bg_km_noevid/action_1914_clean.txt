1914: Carnivores: Alter feeding schedule according to visitor activity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Animal behaviour can be influenced by the presence of zoo visitors [1]. Responses to visitor activity are often species- and individual-specific and consequently adjusting visiting times according to the needs of specific animals might improve their welfare.
