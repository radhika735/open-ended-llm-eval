1958: Deter bats from turbines using low-level ultraviolet light
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that bats may approach wind turbines because they misidentify them as trees (Cryan et al. 2014). Illuminating turbines with ultraviolet light may help bats to differentiate between wind turbines and trees. A study in the USA found that the activity of Hawaiian hoary bats Lasiurus cinereus semotus was lower at trees lit with dim flickering ultraviolet lights than at unlit trees (Gorresen et al. 2015). However, this has yet to be tested at wind turbines.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of deterring bats from turbines using low-level ultraviolet light on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
