1174: Compensate for woodland removal with compensatory planting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Forests or woods that are converted into new development areas suffer from almost total loss of the original biodiversity. Therefore, carrying out compensatory planting in new development areas should have a positive effect on biodiversity. However, the species assemblages are likely to be very different to those of the original forest. Using the dominant trees and shrub species of the original forest for the compensatory planting may contribute to the conservation of some of the original forest species.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of compensatory planting on forests.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
