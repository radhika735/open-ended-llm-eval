1797: Create legislation for ‘no net loss’ of wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Legislation may be developed to ensure no net loss of habitat. Simply, this means that any habitat lost to development must be compensated for by restoration or creation elsewhere. For example, under the Clean Water Act in the USA, a permit for development on wetlands may only be granted if there are plans to restore or create other wetlands. Alternatively, wetlands can be ‘bought’ from a ‘bank’ of restoration or creation projects to offset damage done by a particular development (Burgin 2010).
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: legally protect peatlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland habitats, of creating legislation for no net loss of wetlands.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
