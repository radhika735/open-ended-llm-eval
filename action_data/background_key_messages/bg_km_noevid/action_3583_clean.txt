3583: Switch to land-based aquaculture systems 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems may discharge water with waste and effluents into aquatic environments causing pollution and habitat degradation with adverse impacts on reptiles. Typical wastes include faeces, excess feed and nutrients, and chemicals, such as disinfectants, antifoulants, pesticides, herbicides, and drugs for disease control. Switching to land-based systems may lead to reductions in pollution, with positive impacts on reptile populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of switching to land-based aquaculture systems.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
