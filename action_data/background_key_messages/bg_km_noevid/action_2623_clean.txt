2623: Promote sustainable alternative livelihoods
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conserving biodiversity and eliminating poverty are linked global challenges. The poor, particularly the rural poor, depend on nature for many elements of their livelihoods, including food, fuel, shelter and medicines. By promoting sustainable alternative livelihoods, and/or livelihood diversification, the aim is to provide or encourage other sources of income that reduce pressure on natural resources, such as mammals, to sustainable levels. There is a wide diversity of potential alternative sources of income, which depend on the situation, but include activities such as the development of other small scale productions systems, eco-tourism or craft work for example. Working alongside people who will ultimately benefit from conservation can build social capital, improve accountability, reduce poverty and result in more effective biodiversity conservation.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of promoting sustainable alternative livelihoods on mammals.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
