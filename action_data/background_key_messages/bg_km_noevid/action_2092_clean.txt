2092: Use moorings which reduce or avoid contact with the seabed (eco- moorings)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Moorings, permanent or temporary, provide an alternative to anchoring and allow for reduced anchoring in the area. Moorings can be provided for recreational vessels, as well as commercial vessels up to specific sizes. However, moorings also impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through chronic damage and physical disturbance to the seabed (Griffiths et al. 2017). Moorings that reduce or avoid contact with the seabed, known as eco-moorings, could be used to reduce disturbance and prevent physical damage to subtidal benthic invertebrates from mooring structures (Demers et al. 2013). Evidence for other interventions related to mooring are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Periodically move and relocate moorings”, and “Provide additional moorings to reduce anchoring”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using moorings which reduce or avoid contact with the seabed (eco-moorings) on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
