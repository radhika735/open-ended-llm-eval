2042: Promote careful bat-related eco-tourism to improve behaviour towards bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Eco-tourism may help to promote bat conservation and raise funds for conservation and research. However, it requires careful implementation as large-scale or unregulated eco-tourism can cause considerable disturbance to bats (e.g. Biswas et al. 2011).
