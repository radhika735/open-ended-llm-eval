3851: Design the route of roads to maximize habitat block size  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The construction of new roads can not only destroy tracts of habitat, but fragment remaining areas into smaller, more isolated blocks. However, more careful planning may allow impacts to be reduced by routing new roads around, rather than through, important habitat. This could conserve larger patches of habitat for butterflies and moths.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of designing the route of roads to maximize habitat block size.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
