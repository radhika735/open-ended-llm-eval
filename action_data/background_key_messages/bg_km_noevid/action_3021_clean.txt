3021: Build barriers to protect littoral areas from boat wakes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Littoral marshes and swamps (i.e. on sea or lake shores) are vulnerable to erosion and physical damage from boat and jet ski wakes – especially when this activity is regular, concentrated and close to the shore (Bilkovic et al. 2017). Barriers between focal marshes or swamps and the main water body may help to diffuse energy. Barriers might be dykes, walls, breakwaters, reefs, or even created marshes or swamps!
Related actions: Use artificial barriers to block pollution;     Build barriers to protect littoral habitats from rising water levels and severe weather (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of building barriers to protect littoral marshes or swamps from boat wakes.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
