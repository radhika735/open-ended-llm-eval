90: Manage short-rotation coppice to benefit wildlife (includes 8 m rides)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Short-rotation coppice consists of areas of densely planted willow or poplar which are harvested on a 2-5 year cycle (Defra 2004). Eight-metre wide headlands at the end of each area of coppice are required to allow vehicles to turn and rides along the crop edges are required for machinery access. Both rides and headlands may be sown with grass and cut twice each year (Defra 2004).
