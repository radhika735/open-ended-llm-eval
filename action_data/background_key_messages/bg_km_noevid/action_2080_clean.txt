2080: Set limits on the area that can be covered by utility and service lines at one location
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Utility and service lines, such as communication and power cables, and oil and gas pipelines, can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and habitat loss. Limits could be set on the area of seabed that can be covered by utility and service lines. This may reduce the level and spatial extent of threat by preventing additional installation, and therefore benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting limits on the area that can be covered by utility and service lines at one location on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
