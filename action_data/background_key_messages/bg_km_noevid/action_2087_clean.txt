2087: Divert shipping routes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Shipping can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbance, introduction of non-native species and pollution. Shipping routes could be diverted, either permanently or temporarily, to reduce the level of impact at one location, and allow for natural recovery. This may potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates through reduced disturbance.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of diverting shipping routes on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
