2877: Reduce the amount of pesticides used in aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides are chemicals used in aquaculture to reduce or eliminate pests. However, pesticides may contaminate aquatic environments with adverse impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. The risks associated with using pesticides may be reduced by applying them in smaller doses, less frequently or across a smaller area. Alternatively, live organisms may be used instead of chemicals to control pests (Thresher 2005).
