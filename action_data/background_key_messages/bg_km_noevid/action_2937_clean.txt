2937: Use biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Biocides are chemical substances or microorganisms used with the intention of controlling an invasive or problematic species. Using biocides or other chemicals, such as chemical inhibitors, to reduce or control invasive or problematic species may lower the risk they pose to marine and freshwater mammals. However, some biocides are toxic and may contaminate marine and freshwater environments.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
