811: Create habitat connectivity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Creating corridors of native vegetation between suitable habitat patches may enable amphibians to move between isolated populations and therefore help to maintain viable populations.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of creating habitat connectivity on amphibian populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
