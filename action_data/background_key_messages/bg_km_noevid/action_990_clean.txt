990: Use shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There are several different shelterwood systems. The basic process is the selective removal of overstorey trees to allow enough light through to the forest floor to create new, even-aged stands below. The remaining mature overstorey trees provide seeds for regeneration and create shelter for the younger trees. Harvesting is done in a series of cuts and may also involve thinning of the lower forest canopies.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using shelterwood cutting instead of ‘gap release’ cutting on bat populations. The study was in Australia. We found no studies that evaluated the effects of shelterwood cutting instead of clearcutting.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)      

Use (1 study): One site comparison study in Australia found more Gould’s long-eared bats roosting in remnant trees within forests that had been shelterwood harvested than in forests harvested using gap release methods. Comparisons were not made with clearcutting.
