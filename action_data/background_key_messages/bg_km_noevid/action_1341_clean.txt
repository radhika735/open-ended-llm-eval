1341: Primates: Use of automated feeders
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anticipating the arrival of food can lead to stress behaviours in captive animals. Automated feeders work by dispensing fresh food in pre-measured quantities, at timed intervals throughout the day with the aim of increasing time spent searching for, extracting and consuming food.  
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of using an automated feeder for primates.
