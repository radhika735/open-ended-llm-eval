2946: Remove residential or commercial development
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Parking lots, shopping centres, housing, industrial facilities or tourist sites are sometimes built on marshes or swamps. Removing such developments could allow marsh or swamp vegetation to recover (e.g. at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in California, USA; Brennan 2017), or provide an opportunity to create new marshes or swamps.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Isolated habitat patches can be linked with continuous habitat corridors, or with discrete habitat patches as stepping stones (Bennett 2003). Linkages could improve survival prospects and diversity of plant populations in habitat patches (Damschen et al. 2006), because seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can be moved along them (e.g. by animals). Caution: Habitat linkages can also allow diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).
Studies of this action could involve linkages of any habitat type, as long as effects on marsh or swamp vegetation are evaluated.

2948: Integrate marshes or swamps into developed areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marsh or swamp habitats could be intentionally retained within developed areas (e.g. Densu Delta Ramsar Site in Accra, Ghana). Alternatively or additionally, they could be created or restored within existing developments – at a range of scales, from the 30-ha London Wetland Centre to green roofs on individual buildings (Song et al. 2013). Wetlands within developed areas can provide numerous benefits to people within developed areas, from water storage and purification to recreation and relaxation (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2018). An assessment of the effects of conservation on such “ecosystem services” is beyond the scope of this synopsis.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should evaluate its overall effects, e.g. by comparing comparisons of plant diversity in marshes or swamps before and after development that deliberately retained these habitats. Assessments of vegetation within specific protected, restored or created sites are summarized under other actions.

2949: Implement ‘mosaic management’ of farmland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways, across large scales. For example, patches of agricultural land or aquaculture pools could be interspersed with natural marsh vegetation that is never harvested or sustainably harvested. Alternatively, in a set of fields or farms, half could be cultivated at any one time whilst half are left undisturbed. Note that mosaic management involving marshes or swamps may only be possible if the farmed areas are kept wet: draining patches of land for agriculture can lower the entire local water table.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have considered the overall effectiveness of mosaic management, comparing marsh or swamp vegetation across the whole mosaic to an area not under mosaic management (e.g. traditional farmland or nature reserves; Oosterveld et al. 2010). Studies comparing vegetation between individual patches would be summarized elsewhere in the synopsis.

2951: Regulate farming to allow gradual regeneration of marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The Tanzanian Forest Service provides renewable, one-year licenses that allow rice farming to continue if the farmers allow mangrove trees to grow. The intention is that several years later, the farmland is abandoned because the trees cast too much shade for the rice, and full regeneration of the mangrove habitat can occur (Evans 2017). This principle could be applied to other habitats. However, such a scheme creates a perverse incentive for farmers to prevent recovery of the target vegetation to avoid being forced off their land (Evans 2017). Even if farmers do abandon their original plot following habitat regeneration, it is possible they will clear vegetation elsewhere to begin farming again.
Related actions: Abandon cropland (freshwater – brackish/saline);     Abandon plantations; Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed sites (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps.

2952: Abandon cropland: allow freshwater marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Background
It may be possible that marshes or swamps will recover on their own, without any active intervention, if human activities are stopped. Such passive recovery can be cheaper than active intervention and allow development of a community well adapted to local conditions. However, plant colonization may not occur at all or, if it does, occur slowly or be dominated by invasive species (Zahawi et al. 2014). Successful recovery may be hindered by physical degradation (e.g. a water table that is too low, restricted tidal exchange), chemical degradation (e.g. acidification of wetland soils when exposed to oxygen) or an insufficient supply of propagules.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have monitored cropland that has been abandoned (farming activities completely stopped, with no additional intervention) with the expectation that marshes or swamps could recover. Therefore, the summarized evidence is best considered as an indication of what kind of vegetation can develop in abandoned cropland, and how long it takes to develop, rather than a complete survey of all relevant evidence. The outcome of abandonment could be very different depending on whether it occurs after a final clearance of crops or not; both options are within the scope of this action.
Related actions: Abandon plantations;     Abandon aquaculture facilities;   Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed sites (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Modify farming practices in watershed, including abandonment of cropland (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of abandoning cropland with the expectation that freshwater marshes or swamps would recover spontaneously. There was one study in each of Spain, South Korea, China and Japan. The studies involved former rice fields, soybean fields or pastures.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in South Korea and Japan reported that the overall plant community composition in abandoned cropland became more like natural swamps and/or marshes over time.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One site comparison study on a floodplain in Japan found that pastures abandoned for 5–25 years contained a higher richness of vascular, wetland plant species than pastures that remained in use. One study in South Korea simply reported the number of plant species in abandoned rice paddies increased over time.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study on a floodplain in Japan found that pastures abandoned for 5–25 years typically contained more marsh-indicator and swamp-indicator species than pastures that remained in use.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One site comparison study in China found that vegetation biomass in abandoned soybean fields was lower than in natural wet meadows after three years, similar to natural wet meadows after six years, and higher than in natural wet meadows after 12 years. One study in Spain simply quantified the peak biomass and density of vegetation in rice fields abandoned for up to six years. Biomass, but not density, increased with time since abandonment.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study in China found that soybean fields abandoned for 3–12 years contained vegetation of a similar height to natural wet meadows.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One site comparison study in South Korea reported that rice fields abandoned for 10 years contained thinner-stemmed Japanese alder Alnus japonica than mature alder forests.

2954: Flood cropland when fallow to conserve freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years, when crops are not being grown, could allow wetland plant communities to develop temporarily. If this fallow period occurs within a yearly cycle, annual plant species will dominate. If the fallow period is long enough and at the right time of year, these species may be able to complete their life cycle within cropland.
Related interventions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes or swamps; Raise water level to restore/create marshes or swamps from other land uses.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on freshwater marsh vegetation, of flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years. The study was in Brazil.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period affected the overall community composition of wetland plants, but that the nature of the effect depended on when fields were surveyed.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period had no significant effect on wetland plant species richness per site and per survey, although fewer species were recorded in the flooded fields over the year of the study.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves excluding livestock – with physical barriers such as fences or hedgerows, or virtual barriers involving GPS trackers and negative sounds or electric shocks (SRUC 2015) – from an area of natural, ungrazed marsh or swamp. Here, “ungrazed” refers to the recent history of a site, so studies of sites that have not been recently grazed and so have regained their natural ecological character would also be included here.
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013).

2963: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves excluding livestock – with physical barriers such as fences or hedgerows, or virtual barriers involving GPS trackers and negative sounds or electric shocks (SRUC 2015) – from an area of natural, ungrazed marsh or swamp. Here, “ungrazed” refers to the recent history of a site, so studies of sites that have not been recently grazed and so have regained their natural ecological character would also be included here.
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013).
Related actions: Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed brackish/salt marshes; Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance; Use grazing to control problematic plants; Exclude wild vertebrates; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using barriers to keep livestock off brackish/salt marshes that have never (or not recently) been grazed. The study was in the UK.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the UK reported that plots fenced to exclude sheep contained more plant species, after four years, than plots that became grazed by sheep.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a salt marsh in the UK reported that plots fenced to exclude sheep contained more vegetation biomass, after two years, than plots that became grazed by sheep.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study also quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, plots fenced to exclude sheep contained more cordgrass Spartina and less saltbush Atriplex hastata, after four years, than plots that became grazed by sheep.

2966: Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves completely excluding or completely removing livestock from marshes or swamps that have been negatively impacted by livestock grazing – whether deliberate or accidental. This may be implemented at a large scale (e.g. removing livestock from an entire farm) or at a small scale (e.g. tethering cattle to keep them off sensitive vegetation patches).
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013). Removing livestock can allow grazing-sensitive species to recover. The effects might depend on site conditions such as productivity (determined by soil moisture and nutrient levels; Berney et al. 2014).
Related actions: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed freshwater marshes; Reduce intensity of livestock grazing, without completely removing livestock; Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance; Use grazing to control problematic plants; Exclude wild vertebrates; Modify livestock farming practices in watershed; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of excluding or removing livestock from historically grazed freshwater marshes. Seven studies were in the USA, two were in Morocco and one was in Australia. In all 10 studies the focal livestock included cattle (mixed with sheep in the two studies in Morocco). Two studies in the USA were based on the same experimental set-up, and the two studies in Morocco shared some study sites.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (4 studies): Two site comparison studies in Morocco and the USA reported that marshes/pools fenced to exclude livestock for 3–30 years contained a different overall plant community to grazed sites. In the USA, the precise effect depended on the time since exclusion. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in marshes in Australia and the USA found that fencing to exclude cattle typically had no significant effect on the overall plant community composition after 1–14 years. One of the studies also found that the plant community in fenced and grazed marshes was of similar quality, relative to pristine local marshes.
Relative abundance (3 studies): Of three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies that reported data on the relative abundance of plant groups, two studies (based on one experimental set-up) in the USA found that ephemeral pools fenced to exclude cattle for 1–10 years had similar or greater cover of grasses relative to forbs than pools that remained grazed. The other study, also in the USA, found that the relative abundance of forbs, grass-like plants and shrubs was similar in marshes fenced to exclude cattle for 1–3 years and marshes that remained grazed.
Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Four replicated studies (two also randomized, paired, controlled) in the USA, Morocco and Australia found that marshes/pools fenced to exclude cattle, for 1–30 years, typically had similar overall plant species richness to sites that remained grazed. One of the studies found that the same was true for overall plant diversity. One replicated, site comparison study of ephemeral pools in Morocco found that pools fenced to exclude livestock for &gt;30 years had similar (in a dry year) or greater (in a wet year) plant species richness compared to pools that remained grazed. One site comparison study in the USA found that marshes fenced to exclude cattle for 3–13 years contained fewer plant species than grazed marshes, and had similar or lower plant diversity.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study of ephemeral pools in Morocco found that pools fenced to exclude livestock for &gt;30 years contained a similar number of wetland-characteristic plant species to pools that remained grazed.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (3 studies): Of three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies that reported data on native plant species richness, two studies (based on one experimental set-up) in the USA found that fencing ephemeral pools to exclude cattle for 1–10 years typically reduced native plant species richness. The other study, also in the USA, found that native plant species richness was similar in marshes fenced to exclude cattle for 1–3 years and marshes that remained grazed.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Morocco found that ponds/pools fenced to exclude cattle for &gt;10 years contained more vegetation than sites that remained grazed. This was measured in terms of emergent cover around pond margins or peak above-ground biomass in ephemeral pools. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Australia found that marshes fenced to exclude cattle for ≤4 years contained similar above-ground vegetation biomass to marshes that remained grazed.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One site comparison study of ephemeral pools in Morocco found that the overall abundance of wetland-characteristic plant species was greater in pools fenced to exclude livestock for &gt;30 years than in pools that remained grazed.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that fencing pastures to exclude cattle typically increased herb cover in wetlands along creeks, but had no significant effect on herb cover within spring wetlands.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in Australia and the USA quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species (see original papers for data).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that ponds fenced to exclude cattle for &gt;10 years had greater horizontal vegetation cover, around their margins, than ponds that remained grazed.
Height (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one also randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in the USA found that fencing ponds to exclude cattle, for 1–3 or &gt;10 years, increased the height of vegetation around their margins.

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of excluding or removing livestock from historically grazed brackish/salt marshes. There were five studies in Germany. There were two studies in the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands. There was one study in each of the USA, Sweden, France and Argentina. Livestock were sheep, cattle, sheep and cattle, cattle and horses, or unspecified. There was overlap in the sites used in two studies. Two other studies took place in one marsh, but with different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled study of a salt marsh in Germany reported that in a plot fenced to exclude cattle for eight years, the total vegetated area was greater than in a plot that remained grazed.
Community types (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish and salt marshes in Germany reported that reducing (or stopping) grazing affected the nature of transitions between vegetation types over time, but that the precise effect varied with environmental conditions.
Community composition (5 studies): Three paired studies (two also replicated and controlled) in brackish/salt marshes in France, Argentina and the Netherlands reported that the effect of excluding livestock for 5–30 years on the overall plant community composition depended on plot elevation/flooding regime. In one of these studies, the effect of livestock exclusion was not separated from the effect of general legal protection. Two studies in one salt marsh in Denmark reported that excluding livestock had little effect on the identity of plant species in the community after six years.
Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Two studies (one controlled, one before-and-after) in one salt marsh in Denmark reported that excluding sheep and cattle for 6–7 years had no effect on overall plant species richness. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported that plots fenced to exclude cattle for seven years had lower plant species richness than areas that remained grazed. Two controlled studies (one also replicated and paired) in salt marshes in Germany found that the effect of removing sheep on overall plant species richness depended on the scale of measurement and the grazing intensity used for comparison – with inconsistent results across these studies even for similar scales and intensities. One paired, site comparison study of salt marshes in Argentina found that the effect of excluding cattle (along with legal protection) increased plant species richness at lower elevations, but did not significantly affect plant diversity at any elevation.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Three studies (two controlled, one before-and-after) in salt marshes in the UK and Denmark reported that excluding livestock for 2–6 years maintained or increased overall vegetation abundance (although in one study, only by a small amount). One controlled study in a salt marsh in Germany found that a paddock left ungrazed for 16–18 years had greater overall vegetation cover than lightly or heavily grazed paddocks, but lower cover than a moderately grazed paddock.
Individual species abundance (11 studies): Eleven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies (four controlled, one before-and-after) on salt marshes in the UK, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands reported that excluding livestock for 2–8 years reduced (or prevented increases in) cover of saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima. However, two controlled studies (one also replicated and paired) on salt marshes in Denmark and Sweden reported greater saltmarsh grass cover in areas fenced to exclude livestock for 1–6 years than in areas that remained grazed. Four studies (three controlled, one before-and-after) on salt marshes in Denmark and Germany reported that excluding or removing livestock for 4–16 years increased cover of sea purslane Halimione portulacoides.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (5 studies): Five controlled studies (two also replicated and paired) in salt marshes in Sweden and Germany, and brackish wet grassland in the UK, found that ungrazed plots (livestock excluded or removed) contained taller vegetation than plots that remained grazed. Vegetation was surveyed after one month, 1–8 years or 16–22 years.

2970: Reduce intensity of livestock grazing: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013). Reducing grazing intensity might allow grazing-sensitive species to recover. However, maintaining some grazing may sustain a mosaic of short and tall vegetation patches, each favouring different plant species (Nolte et al. 2014). The effects of this action might depend on site conditions such as productivity (determined by soil moisture and nutrient levels; Berney et al. 2014).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared different grazing intensities, without completely removing livestock. Grazing intensity could be reduced by altering grazing duration (e.g. allowing livestock to graze for fewer days) or pressure (e.g. letting fewer animals graze, providing supplementary food as an alternative to living plants, encouraging grazing away from focal areas by feeding stations or shelter elsewhere). Comparisons must involve the same type of livestock and at least some overlap in the timing of grazing.
When interpreting the evidence, remember that the overall grazing intensity for a site does not necessarily reflect the local grazing intensity in wetland patches or in different vegetation types. Also note that “low”, “moderate” and “high” are relative terms within each study: they do not always refer to the same absolute intensity across studies.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing livestock grazing intensity in freshwater marshes (without stopping grazing entirely). Two studies were in the USA and the other was in Ireland. In all three studies, livestock were cattle.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Ireland found that lightly and heavily grazed wet meadows contained a similar overall mix of plant species.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that seasonally and continuously grazed ephemeral pools had similar cover of grasses relative to forbs.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Ireland found that lightly and heavily grazed wet meadows had similar overall plant species richness.
Native plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that seasonally and continuously grazed ephemeral pools experienced similar changes in native plant species richness over three years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Ireland reported that lightly and heavily grazed wet meadows had similar overall vegetation cover.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that lightly and moderately grazed springs/creeks had similar herb cover.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One study quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The site comparison study in Ireland reported, for example, that lightly grazed wet meadows had greater cover of black sedge Carex nigra, and lower cover of creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, than more heavily grazed wet meadows.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing livestock grazing intensity in brackish/salt marshes (without stopping grazing entirely). Five studies were in Germany. Four studies were in the Netherlands. Livestock were cattle, sheep or horses. There was overlap in the sites used in two of the German studies and three of the Dutch studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled study of a salt marsh in Germany reported that the total vegetated area was slightly larger in plots grazed at a lower intensity, for eight years, than plots grazed at a higher intensity.
Community types (4 studies): Two controlled studies of salt marshes in Germany and the Netherlands reported similar coverage, or similar change in coverage, of plant community types under different grazing intensities. Two studies of brackish and salt marshes in the Netherlands and Germany reported that reducing grazing intensity (along with other interventions) affected coverage of plant community types. In one study, the precise effect varied with environmental conditions.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots grazed under different grazing intensities experienced a similar turnover of plant species over six years, and had a similar overall plant community composition after six years.
Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Three replicated, paired, controlled studies on salt marshes in Germany and the Netherlands found that plots grazed at lower intensities never had greater plant species richness, after 1–22 years, than plots grazed at higher intensities. One controlled study on a salt marsh in Germany found that paddocks grazed at low intensity had greater plant species richness, after 16–18 years, than paddocks grazed at higher intensities. Two studies of salt marshes in the Netherlands found that plant species richness increased over 6–14 years of reduced grazing intensity (sometimes along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One controlled study on a salt marsh in Germany reported that overall vegetation cover was greater in lightly and moderately grazed paddocks than in a heavily grazed paddock – with the highest cover of all in the moderately grazed paddock.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, three studies (including two controlled) on salt marshes in Germany and the Netherlands reported that plots under different grazing intensities supported a similar abundance (frequency or cover) of saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima – but with a tendency for greater abundance under lower intensities.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (6 studies): Six controlled studies (three also replicated and paired) in salt marshes in Germany and the Netherlands reported that vegetation was taller on average (or contained taller vegetation patches) in areas that had been grazed at lower intensities. However, in one of the studies, this was only true for canopy height: understory grasses were a similar height under all grazing intensities. One of the replicated, paired, controlled studies found that, after two summers, variation in vegetation height between patches was similar under all grazing intensities.

When interpreting the evidence, remember that the overall grazing intensity for a site does not necessarily reflect the local grazing intensity in wetland patches or in different vegetation types. Also note that “low”, “moderate” and “high” are relative terms within each study: they do not always refer to the same absolute intensity across studies.

2973: Reduce intensity of livestock grazing: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013). Reducing grazing intensity might allow grazing-sensitive species to recover. However, maintaining some grazing may sustain a mosaic of short and tall vegetation patches, each favouring different plant species (Nolte et al. 2014). The effects of this action might depend on site conditions such as productivity (determined by soil moisture and nutrient levels; Berney et al. 2014).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared different grazing intensities, without completely removing livestock. Grazing intensity could be reduced by altering grazing duration (e.g. allowing livestock to graze for fewer days) or pressure (e.g. letting fewer animals graze, providing supplementary food as an alternative to living plants, encouraging grazing away from focal areas by feeding stations or shelter elsewhere). Comparisons must involve the same type of livestock and at least some overlap in the timing of grazing.
When interpreting the evidence, remember that the overall grazing intensity for a site does not necessarily reflect the local grazing intensity in wetland patches or in different vegetation types.

2974: Change season/timing of livestock grazing: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Grazing could have different effects on wetland vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid grazing when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the wetland vegetation. Additionally, the effects of trampling may vary by season, being lowest in summer when a seasonal wetland might be dry or winter when the soil may be frozen. Seasonal variation in the value of the wetland plants as food for livestock could also contribute to the decision of when to allow grazing.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should have compared grazing in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 0.5 cows/ha every summer vs 1 cow/ha every other summer). The overall grazing intensity and type of livestock must have been similar under each treatment.
Related actions: Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed sites; Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance; Use grazing to control problematic plants; Modify livestock farming practices in watershed.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of grazing freshwater marshes in different seasons or at different times. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Canada. In all three studies, the livestock were cattle.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes and wet meadows in the USA reported that plots grazed in the summer and autumn experienced similar changes in overall plant community composition over a year.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study of ephemeral pools in the USA found that pools grazed in the dry or wet seasons had similar cover of grasses relative to forbs over three years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of freshwater marshes in Canada found that in summer, marshes grazed in the summer/autumn contained more plant genera than marshes grazed in the spring/summer.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study of ephemeral pools in the USA found that pools grazed in the dry and wet seasons experienced similar changes in native plant richness over three years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes and wet meadows the USA found that, in three of four habitat types, summer- and autumn-grazed plots experienced similar changes in live vegetation biomass over one year.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of freshwater marshes in Canada found that in summer, marshes grazed in the summer/autumn contained taller emergent vegetation than marshes grazed in the spring/summer.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots grazed annually by 0.5 cattle/ha and plots grazed biennially by 1.0 cattle/ha experienced a similar turnover of plant species over six years, and had a similar overall plant community composition after six years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that plots grazed annually by 0.5 cattle/ha and plots grazed biennially by 1.0 cattle/ha experienced similar increases in plant species richness over six years, and had similar species richness after six years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that summer- and autumn-grazed plots experienced similar changes in live vegetation biomass, over one year.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that grazing annually with 0.5 cattle/ha stimulated greater increases in cover of sea aster Aster tripolium than grazing biennially with 1.0 cattle/ha. There was no significant difference between the grazing regimes for cover of sea couch grass Elytrigia atheria. Vegetation was monitored over six years.

2978: Change type of livestock grazing: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Changing the species or breed of livestock grazing in marshes or swamps could reduce undesirable impacts. For example, trampling impacts could be reduced by replacing heavy cows with sheep, rabbits or ducks. Additionally, different species and breeds of livestock feed in different ways, leading to different impacts on vegetation (Adler et al. 2001; Loucougaray et al. 2004). Sheep maintain shorter, more uniform lawns of vegetation than cattle which leave tufts of longer vegetation, whilst horses can maintain patches of short vegetation. Traditional or heritage livestock breeds may consume different species of plants in different amounts to modern breeds (Tolhurst & Oates 2001). The temperament of livestock may also be an important consideration, with docile breeds being easier to manage around people.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should ideally have compared grazing by different types of livestock at similar times and at a similar overall intensity. However, variation in timing and intensity might be inextricably linked to the change in livestock species (e.g. Nolte et al. 2014).

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of allowing different types of livestock to graze brackish/salt marshes. There was overlap in the sites used in the studies, which all compared cattle and horse grazing on one salt marsh in the Netherlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots experienced similar changes in the area of a couch-grass-dominated community, over four years, whether grazed by cattle or horses.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots grazed by cattle and plots grazed by horses experienced a similar turnover of plant species over six years, and had a similar overall plant community composition after six years.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies on one salt marsh in the Netherlands found that plots grazed by cattle and plots grazed by horses had similar plant species richness after 1–6 years. One of the studies also reported similar increases in species richness over six years, whether plots were grazed by cattle or horses.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study on a salt marsh in the Netherlands3 found that plots grazed by cattle and plots grazed by horses experienced similar changes in the cover of two salt marsh herb species, over six years.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): Of two replicated, paired, controlled studies on one salt marsh in the Netherlands, one found that horses maintained shorter late-summer vegetation than cattle after two years of grazing. The other study found that horses and cattle maintained late-summer vegetation of a similar height, over four years. The first study also examined variation in height between vegetation patches, and found no significant difference between horse- and cattle-grazed plots.

2982: Abandon aquaculture facilities: allow freshwater marshes or swamps to recover without active intervention
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It may be possible that marshes or swamps will recover on their own, without any active intervention, if human activities are stopped. Such passive recovery can be cheaper than active intervention and allow development of a community well adapted to local conditions. However, plant colonization may not occur at all or, if it does, occur slowly or be dominated by invasive species (Zahawi et al. 2014). Successful recovery may be hindered by physical degradation (e.g. a water table that is too low, restricted tidal exchange), chemical degradation (e.g. acidification of wetland soils when exposed to oxygen) or an insufficient supply of propagules.
To be summarized as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored marshes or swamps after the abandonment of aquaculture facilities within them (stock removed and maintenance completely stopped, with no additional intervention). Therefore, the summarized evidence is best considered as an indication of what kind of vegetation can develop after abandonment of aquacultural facilities, and how long it takes to develop, rather than a complete survey of all relevant evidence.

2986: Retain/create habitat linkages in areas of energy production or mining
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Isolated habitat patches can be linked with continuous habitat corridors, or with discrete habitat patches as stepping stones (Bennett 2003). Linkages could improve survival prospects and diversity of plant populations in habitat patches (Damschen et al. 2006), because seeds, pollen or vegetation fragments can be moved along them (e.g. by animals). Caution: Habitat linkages can also allow diseases, non-native species and fire to spread between patches (Resasco et al. 2014).
Studies of this action could involve linkages of any habitat type, as long as effects on marsh or swamp vegetation are evaluated.
Related actions: Retain/create habitat linkages in developed areas; Retain/create habitat linkages in farmed areas; Retain/create habitat linkages across service corridors.

2987: Backfill canals or trenches: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Backfilling involves returning dredged or excavated material to a canal (e.g. dug for boat traffic) or trench (e.g. dug for pipelines). Sometimes additional soil or sediment is brought in if there is not enough excavated material left. In theory, backfilling restores more natural wetland conditions: the water depth in the canal and the height of adjacent spoil heaps are both reduced. The whole area then has more natural water levels and may support desirable marsh or swamp vegetation. Backfilling a canal will usually prevent boats from using it too. The success of this action may depend heavily on the skill of the operator, e.g. their ability to create the desired water/soil elevations and avoid overcompacting the fill material. Turner et al. (1994) estimated that backfilling canals in Louisiana cost US$1.20/m3 (US$1.98 corrected to 2017).
For this action, as throughout the synopsis, we have only summarized results that are solely or predominantly related to the specified habitat. For example, the results in Turner et al. (1994) combine data from approximately 80% brackish or salt marshes and 20% freshwater marshes – so they have not been summarized as evidence for freshwater marshes.
Evidence summarized for this action relates to effects on vegetation within or immediately adjacent to canals or trenches, dug as or associated with service corridors.
Related actions: Plug/dam canals or trenches; Raise water level to restore degraded marshes; Raise water level to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Fill/block ditches not associated with service corridors; Remove surface soil/sediment.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of backfilling canals or trenches in freshwater marshes. All three studies were in the USA. There was overlap in the canals used in two of the studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Three replicated studies in freshwater marshes in the USA reported coverage of emergent marsh vegetation between 6 months and 25 years after backfilling. All three studies reported that coverage was greater on former spoil areas alongside canals than within the partly filled canal channels.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a freshwater marsh in the USA reported that in levelled former spoil areas alongside backfilled canals, the relative abundance of some key plant species differed from natural marshland. Vegetation was surveyed three years after backfilling.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of backfilling canals or trenches in brackish/salt marshes. All four studies were in the USA. There was overlap in the canals used in three of the studies. All studies included some freshwater areas in some analyses, but all results are based predominantly on canals in brackish or saline marshes.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (4 studies): One paired, site comparison study in marshes in the USA reported that emergent vegetation coverage was typically lower in backfilled canals, after four years, than in adjacent undisturbed marsh. Three other studies in marshes in the USA simply reported coverage of emergent marsh vegetation between 6 months and 25 years after backfilling canals. All four studies reported that coverage was greater on former spoil areas alongside canals than within the partly filled canal channels. Two of the studies also reported the frequency of submerged/floating vegetation after 6–60 months, and one reported coverage of upland plant species on spoil banks that had not been completely levelled after 6–11 years.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in marshes in the USA reported that former spoil areas alongside backfilled canals had greater plant species richness than nearby natural marsh, due to the presence of upland species on unlevelled areas. One other study of a backfilled canal in predominantly brackish and saline marshes in the USA simply quantified richness of submerged vegetation four years after backfilling.

2991: Plug/dam canals or trenches: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Canals or trenches contribute to marsh and swamp degradation by allowing water of the ‘wrong’ salinity to enter (typically salty water entering freshwater or brackish sites, when canals or trenches are dug in coastal areas; LCWCRTF 2002), allowing increased water flow or tidal exchange (thus increasing rates of erosion), and/or by allowing water levels to fluctuate. Simply constructing a plug or dam at the mouth of a canal or trench, using materials such as wood or oyster shells, might reduce or solve these problems (NFWF 1995; LCWCRTF 2002).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Transportation or service corridors can block water flows into or out of wetlands (Shuldiner & Cope 1979). However, careful design and construction could minimize this effect, maintaining the amount, timing and quality of water flows. Specific features to facilitate water movement include permeable fill and logs under the infrastructure running parallel with the direction of flow (Partington et al. 2016).
Related actions: actions to restore water flows across transportation or service corridors, i.e. Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps),     Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes or swamps (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps),     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps)     and     Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create marshes or swamps from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

2997: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting vegetation less often (e.g. every two years instead of every year) will allow more time for it to recover from the disturbance, potentially growing taller and more densely. It might give plants long enough to mature and reproduce. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.
For this action, “reduction” includes stopping harvest altogether. Note that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing, including studies where cut vegetation is not removed.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the frequency of harvest in freshwater marshes (or harvesting at different frequencies). There was one study in each of the USA, Belgium and Italy.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Belgium reported that overall plant species richness was similar in plots harvested once or twice/year.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of harvesting twice/year (in July and October) on total above-ground biomass was intermediate between the effects of harvesting once/year in July or October.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): All three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that cattail Typha biomass was greater, nine months after the last harvest, in plots harvested every six weeks than in plots harvested every three weeks. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in reedbeds in Italy found that the common reed Phragmites australis biomass was similar in plots harvested once or twice/year, when measured at least five months after the last harvest.

3001: Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting vegetation less intensely may increase its capacity to recover. Harvesting a smaller area or removing fewer plants leaves a larger population of plants to grow or spread into harvested gaps. Removing less of each plant might avoid killing them and allow them to regrow. Techniques such as selective harvesting, thinning rather than clear-cutting, and patch retention harvesting are all included within this action.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting vegetation less intensely may increase its capacity to recover. Harvesting a smaller area or removing fewer plants leaves a larger population of plants to grow or spread into harvested gaps. Removing less of each plant might avoid killing them and allow them to regrow. Techniques such as selective harvesting, thinning rather than clear-cutting, and patch retention harvesting are all included within this action.

3005: Change season/timing of vegetation harvest: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The effects of harvesting vegetation – especially on its physical structure at a given time of year – may vary depending on the time of year it is carried out. Caution: In some habitats, regular disturbance such as harvesting may be necessary to maintain the composition and diversity of plant and animal communities.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies should have compared a fixed harvest frequency and intensity, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of plants cut every summer vs 100% of plants cut every other summer).
Related actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest; Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing, including studies where cut vegetation is not removed.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of harvesting vegetation from freshwater marshes in different seasons or at different times. There was one study in Switzerland, one in Belgium and one in Japan.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet meadows in Switzerland reported that summer-harvested and winter-harvested plots experienced similar changes in their overall plant community composition, over 3–4 years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study of wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of a single harvest between June and November on overall plant species richness depended on the month of harvesting.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study of wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of a single harvest between June and November on overall vegetation abundance (including litter) depended on the month of harvesting.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): All three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The studies all reported that individual species’ abundances responded differently to harvesting in different seasons. For example, the controlled, before-and-after study in Japan reported that harvesting in June reduced the abundance of common reed Phragmites australis, in the following summer, more than harvesting in July.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet meadows in Switzerland reported that summer-harvested and winter-harvested plots both experienced a shift in vegetation cover towards lower vegetation layers, over 3–4 years.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): The same study reported that summer harvesting and winter harvesting had opposite effects on the diameter of common reed Phragmites australis shoots: they became thinner over four years of summer harvests but thicker over three years of winter harvests.

Background information and definitions:
The impact of harvesting vegetation could be reduced by switching to supposedly lower-impact methods or equipment. For example, vehicles used for harvesting can compress, sink into and create ruts in wet soils. Lower-impact alternatives include: using specialised tracked vehicles or hovercraft which exert less pressure on the ground (Dubowski et al. 2013); ensuring vehicles are not overloaded and heavy (Schröder et al. 2015); and extracting harvested vegetation by hand or helicopter.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using supposedly low-impact methods to harvest vegetation in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater swamp in the USA reported that after seven years, a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter only contained fewer plant species than a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter and ground vehicles.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater swamp in the USA reported that after seven years, a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter only contained less overall plant biomass than a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter and ground vehicles. This was also true for the overstory and ground layers separately. However, overstory tree density did not significantly differ between helicopter-extracted and vehicle-extracted plots.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study found that the abundance of some individual plant species – particularly swamp ash Fraxinus caroliniana and water tupelo Nyssa aquatica – significantly differed between helicopter-extracted and vehicle-extracted plots.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater swamp in the USA found that after seven years, the average height of the overstory was similar in a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter only and a plot where logs had been extracted by helicopter and ground vehicles.
Diameter, perimeter, area (1 study): The same study found that after seven years, the average stem diameter of overstory trees was similar in helicopter-extracted and vehicle-extracted plots.

3013: Implement ‘mosaic management’ when harvesting wild vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways, across large scales. For example, while some areas of vegetation might be fully harvested in a given year, others might be left untouched. Alternatively, different areas of vegetation may be harvested at different times within a given year, or some areas might be grazed rather than harvested. In any case, different vegetation types in each patch might support different plant (and animal) species, boosting biodiversity across all patches.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have considered the overall effectiveness of mosaic management, comparing marsh or swamp vegetation across the whole mosaic to an area not under mosaic management (e.g. traditional farmland or nature reserves; Oosterveld et al. 2010). Studies comparing vegetation between individual patches would be summarized elsewhere in the synopsis.

3014: Provide new technologies to reduce harvesting pressure on vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Providing new, efficient technologies to people who live in or near marshes or swamps could reduce pressure on wild biological resources. More efficient equipment would use less of the natural resource, reducing the amount that needs to be harvested. For example, fuel-efficient fish-smoking systems installed in Cameroon could reduce the demand for wood, which is largely extracted from mangroves (Feka et al. 2010). New technologies might also have health benefits, such as the production of less, or less harmful, smoke.
To be included as evidence for this action, studies must have quantified the effects of new technologies on marsh or swamp vegetation or human behaviours that threaten it (e.g. the amount of wood harvested). Studies that simply monitor the technologies (e.g. the amount of wood consumed by stoves of different designs) are not included as evidence.

3015: Reduce frequency of hunting/collecting animals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hunting or collecting animals from marshes or swamps (or animals that use these habitats) can damage vegetation. The hunting/collecting activity can directly damage vegetation, e.g. trampling by foot traffic along shorelines used by anglers (USFWS 2006). Removing key animal species can have indirect effects on vegetation. For example, massive die-offs of salt marsh in the southeastern USA were probably related to overharvesting of predatory crabs – which used to eat and control the population of herbivorous snails (Silliman & Bertness 2002). Hunting or collecting animals less often (e.g. every two years instead of every year) may reduce these direct and indirect impacts, or at least give populations longer to recover.
For this action, “reduction” includes stopping harvest altogether. Note that studies comparing areas that remain unharvested to areas that become harvested, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce intensity of hunting/collecting animals;     Control populations of wild vertebrates (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Control populations of wild invertebrates.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reintroducing overharvested animals – to marshes or swamps or the wider landscape – could help to conserve marshes and swamps. Animals such as beavers Castor spp. can directly benefit marshes and swamps: these wetland habitats can develop around beaver ponds, or develop on abandoned beaver ponds as they fill in (Willby et al. 2018). Other animals might benefit marshes and swamps more indirectly. For example, after the re-introduction of grey wolves Canis lupus to Yellowstone National Park, USA in the mid-1990s, elk Cervus elaphus numbers declined (elk are prey for wolves), willow Salix spp. growth and recruitment improved (willow is eaten by elk) and beaver numbers increased (beavers use willows as food and to build dams) – with potential consequences on the number and type of wetlands present across the landscape (Wolf et al. 2007; Ripple & Beschta 2015).
Caution: Introducing animal species where they are not native can have undesirable consequences, on native competitors and the wider environment.

Vehicles such as cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats can directly damage marsh and swamp vegetation (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999; Kelleway 2005). Vehicles can also compress and rut soft, wet soils, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects vegetation. Waves created by boats and jet skis can increase erosion of lake and sea shores (Bilkovic et al. 2017). To prevent this damage, or allow recovery from damage, vehicle use within or near to marshes/swamps could be restricted. This might apply to the total number of vehicles, their speed and/or the routes they can take. Specific means to achieve these restrictions include legislation, voluntary codes, signage and/or ensuring official routes are well maintained.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must include a clear intervention to restrict vehicle use. Studies of different vehicle use intensities imposed by researchers are not included (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999).

Background information and definitions:
Vehicles such as cars, quad bikes, cycles and airboats can directly damage marsh and swamp vegetation (e.g. Hannaford & Resh 1999; Kelleway 2005). They can also compress and rut soft, wet soils, affecting storage and flow of water which in turn affects vegetation. Waves created by boats and jet skis can increase erosion of lake and sea shores (Bilkovic et al. 2017). Vehicles could be physically excluded from pristine marshes and swamps to prevent damage, or from damaged areas to let them recover. Physical barriers could be fences, fallen trees or areas of water/wet ground.
Related actions: Restrict vehicle use, using non-physical means such as signs or voluntary codes.

3021: Build barriers to protect littoral areas from boat wakes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Littoral marshes and swamps (i.e. on sea or lake shores) are vulnerable to erosion and physical damage from boat and jet ski wakes – especially when this activity is regular, concentrated and close to the shore (Bilkovic et al. 2017). Barriers between focal marshes or swamps and the main water body may help to diffuse energy. Barriers might be dykes, walls, breakwaters, reefs, or even created marshes or swamps!
Related actions: Use artificial barriers to block pollution;     Build barriers to protect littoral habitats from rising water levels and severe weather (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

3022: Restrict pedestrian access
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Walking on marshes or swamps can damage their vegetation, soils and hydrology (e.g. Ross 2006; Woolfolk 1999). Pedestrians are a particular problem when they repeatedly walk on the same area e.g. in popular tourist sites, or when scientists make repeat visits to sample plots. To prevent this damage, pedestrian access to marshes and swamps could be reduced by interventions such as legislation, limits on visitor numbers, voluntary codes, signage and/or ensuring official paths are well maintained.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Walking on marshes or swamps can damage their vegetation, soils and hydrology (e.g. Ross 2006; Woolfolk 1999). Pedestrians are a particular problem when they repeatedly walk on the same area e.g. in popular hiking areas, in tourist sites/nature reserves, or when scientists repeatedly visit sample plots. Installing boardwalks or designated paths can prevent physical contact with the marsh or swamp (Vickery 1995) – assuming people stay on them.
Caution: Preservatives leaching from timber may harm vegetation and wildlife. Boardwalks will also shade and kill the vegetation beneath. Paths can compress sediments and alter water flow patterns, above and below the wetland surface.
Related actions: Restrict pedestrian access; Physically exclude pedestrians.

3025: Adopt ecotourism principles/create an ecotourism site
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Tourists may visit marshes and swamps for many reasons, from hiking to biking, skiing, viewing wild animals, photography and relaxation. Tourist visits could be managed with conservation or natural and cultural resources in mind: minimizing damage from tourist activities, educating both staff and visitors, and providing financial resources to conserve natural areas (Ramsar 2012; The International Ecotourism Society 2017). “Voluntourists” – who help with research or conservation activities as part of their tourist experience – can help to collect scientific data and provide a source of income. Ecotourism principles could be adopted by existing tourist sites, or new ecotourism sites could be created.
Ecotourism activities should be carried out sustainably, for example minimizing impact by trampling and employing biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of non-native species. When developing a site aimed at foreign tourists, impacts on local communities should be considered.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have monitored vegetation within ecotourism sites, with a comparison to the situation before ecotourism principles were adopted or to sites not managed under ecotourism principles. This action does not include (a) studies that monitor plant populations or only within ecotourism sites, or (b) studies reporting visitor numbers, economic performance or perceived value of ecotourism sites.

3026: Raise water level to restore degraded freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This action involves one-off action to raise the water level/table in degraded marshes, to a depth that should support emergent vegetation. This means that intervention should (a) occur at one point in time, after which the water level is not actively managed, and (b) must affect a marsh that is drier than normal but that is still recognisable as, or retains substantial characteristics of, the target habitat.
Specific techniques to raise water levels include: blocking drainage ditches (using sediment, rocks, plastic dams, wooden dams or vegetation); building raised embankments, berms or levees to retain water; switching off drainage pumps; ceasing groundwater extraction; installing or widening culverts (e.g. under roads and railways, to increase water flow into focal site); removing dams upstream of the focal site; and reprofiling or diverting river channels to raise the water level on floodplains. All of these techniques aim to make soils saturated or flooded, or make them saturated or flooded for longer, so they can support emergent wetland vegetation. The resulting water level may be stable or fluctuating, and may create permanently or seasonally flooded wetlands. Sediment inputs may also increase in line with water inputs.
Caution: This action may have negative effects on habitats elsewhere in the catchment. For example, removing dams upstream of a focal site could drain wetlands or aquatic habitats upstream of the dam. There may also be conflicts with water needs of human populations that need to be managed.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Actively manage water level; Manage water level to control problematic plants; Reprofile/relandscape or Remove surface soil/sediment, both of which can lower the ground surface towards the water table; Raise water level to complement planting; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including water level manipulations.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level to restore degraded freshwater marshes. There were three studies in the USA and one in each of the Netherlands and Japan.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study of a floodplain in Japan reported that the area covered by marsh vegetation was higher five years after dechannelizing a river than 10 years before.
Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study of a floodplain in Japan reported changes in the area covered by different marsh plant communities over five years after dechannelizing a river compared to 10 years before.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands reported changes in the overall plant community composition after stopping groundwater extraction (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of dune slacks in the Netherlands reported that overall plant species richness was greater in restored slacks (groundwater extraction stopped five years previously, along with other interventions) than in mature unmanaged slacks. One replicated, before-and-after study of floodplain marshes in the USA reported that total plant species richness tended to be lower over nine years after raising the water table than before, but that there was no significant difference for diversity.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the richness of characteristic plant species – typical of dune slacks or nutrient-rich marshes – over five years after stopping groundwater extraction (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study of floodplain marshes in the USA reported that total vegetation cover tended to be lower over nine years after raising the water table than before. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes in the USA found that damming to raise the water table prevented increases in understory vegetation cover over the following year. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified total vegetation over five years after stopping groundwater extraction (along with other interventions). Cover never exceeded 50%.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes in the USA found that damming to raise the water table had no significant effect on cover of sedges Carex There were similar increases in dammed and undammed marshes over one year.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study of floodplain marshes in the USA reported changes in the cover of wetland- and habitat-characteristic plant species over nine years after raising the water table.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this intervention on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported that rewetted floodplain marshes became dominated by a non-native wetland shrub, approximately 4–9 years after raising the water table. One replicated study of a freshwater wetland in the USA reported that the effects of reflooding on the density of emergent plant species depended on the species and water level.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level to restore degraded brackish/salt marshes. One study was in the Netherlands and one was in Tunisia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (2 study): One before-and-after study of a lakeshore brackish/salt marsh in Tunisia reported an increase in coverage of bulrush-dominated vegetation relative to salt marsh vegetation over three years after modifying a canal to retain water in the marsh. One study of a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported increased coverage of pioneer succulent plant communities, and reduced coverage of short-grass communities, over approximately 10 years following abandonment of the drainage system (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported that overall plant species richness increased over 14 years after abandoning drainage systems (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One study of a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported that some individual plant species became more common over 14 years after abandoning drainage systems (along with other interventions). These included saltbush Atriplex prostrata and seablite Suaeda maritima. Some other species became less common, including creeping bentgrass Agrostis stolonifera and common cordgrass Spartina anglica.

3034: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves facilitating tidal exchange to degraded marshes (i.e. still recognisable as, or retaining substantial characteristics of, the target habitat). The action could be a single permanent one (e.g. breaching sea walls or embankments, installing or widening culverts, excavating tidal creeks) or a reversible one (e.g. opening sluice gates once per day). Facilitating tidal exchange can affect multiple properties of a site: it can raise moisture levels, raise or reduce salinity, increase physical disturbance, and increase supplies of sediment and wetland plant propagules.
Tidal wetlands may be brackish/saline (e.g. mangroves, coastal marshes) or freshwater (e.g. at the upstream end of estuaries, as in the Mississippi, Yangtze, and Elbe rivers; Baldwin et al. 2009).
Studies of accidental restoration of tidal exchange, such as when coastal defences are breached by a storm, have not been summarized as evidence.
Related actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Add salt to control problematic plants; Reprofile/relandscape or Remove surface soil/sediment, both of which can alter patterns of tidal exchange.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange to restore degraded brackish/salt marshes. Six studies were in the USA. One study included sites in both the USA and Canada.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA reported that over 10 years after improving tidal exchange in a degraded marsh, the area of salt marsh vegetation increased – but not quite to historical, pre-degradation levels.
Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA reported that 3–10 years after improving tidal exchange in a degraded marsh, the area of salt marsh community types differed from historical, pre-degradation levels.
Community composition (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies in the USA found that in the four years after improving tidal exchange in degraded brackish/salt marshes, the overall plant community composition significantly differed to that present before intervention. However, in one of the studies this was only true in one of two marshes (the most degraded before intervention). One of the studies also reported that the overall plant community composition became more similar to adjacent natural brackish/salt marshes over two growing seasons after intervention.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA/Canada found that overall plant species richness was similar in ≥3-year-old tidally restored salt marshes and nearby natural salt marshes. However, there was also no significant difference between degraded marshes (before tidal restoration) and the natural marshes.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA reported that over three years after restoring tidal exchange (along with a prescribed burn), the number of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the number of freshwater plant species decreased.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that tidally restored areas had a lower overall plant stem density, after 13–54 years, than natural salt marshes.
Characteristic plant abundance (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies of coastal marshes in North America reported that within three years of restoring tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions), total cover of fresh/brackish plant species decreased. In one study the total cover of salt-tolerant plant species increased, but in the other study it did not. One of the studies also found that tidally restored marshes had lower cover of salt-tolerant plants than nearby natural marshes.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. All five studies were in brackish/salt marshes in the USA. Three before-and-after studies reported increases in cover or frequency of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in the four years after improving tidal exchange. One replicated, site comparison study found that smooth cordgrass cover was lower in tidally restored areas than in natural salt marshes, 13–54 years after tidal restoration. Two before-and-after studies reported no clear change in frequency or cover of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens in the four years after improving tidal exchange, but one before-and-after study reported an increase in saltmeadow cordgrass cover over two growing seasons after improving tidal exchange. Four studies reported declines in cover or frequency of less salt-tolerant species such as common reed Phragmites australis and cattails Typha spp. in the four years after improving tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions). One replicated, site comparison study found that common reed cover was similarly low (&lt;1%) in tidally restored areas and natural salt marshes, 13–54 years after tidal restoration.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Vegetation height (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies of brackish/salt marshes in the USA found that common reed was shorter 1–4 years after improving tidal exchange than before. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the maximum vegetation height was similar in tidally restored salt marshes and natural salt marshes, 13–54 years after tidal restoration.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange to restore degraded brackish/saline swamps. Three studies were in Mexico and one was in India.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies on the coasts of India and Mexico reported that the area of mangrove forest in each site was greater 5–6 years after restoring tidal exchange (sometimes along with planting mangrove seedlings) than in the years before.
Community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study of a mangrove forest in Mexico reported that the tree community composition was identical before and five years after restoring tidal exchange: the same three tree species were present at both times.
Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study of a mangrove forest in Mexico reported that the relative coverage of stands dominated by each of three tree species was similar before and five years after restoring tidal exchange.
Tree/shrub richness/diversity (2 studies): One site comparison study in Mexico reported that a tidally restored mangrove forest contained a similar number of tree species to nearby natural mangroves, after 10–11 years. One before-and-after study in Mexico reported identical tree species richness in a mangrove forest before and five years after restoring tidal exchange.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in Mexico reported that tidally restored mangrove forests contained a lower density of trees or seedlings than nearby natural mangroves.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Mexico compared the abundance of three mangrove tree species in a tidally restored area and nearby natural forests (see original paper for data).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): One site comparison study in Mexico reported that trees in a tidally restored mangrove forest were a similar height to trees in nearby natural mangroves, after 10–11 years. Another replicated, site comparison study in Mexico reported that seedlings in a tidally restored mangrove forest were taller than seedlings in a nearby natural mangrove.
Diameter (1 study): One site comparison study in Mexico reported that trees in a tidally restored mangrove forest had a similar diameter to trees in nearby natural mangroves, after 10–11 years.

3038: Actively manage water level: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves active, repeated management of the amount of water in wetlands and when it is present, to mimic the natural hydrology of marshes. This may prevent excessively high or low water levels (e.g. during storm surges or droughts), or maintain wet/dry cycles that are a natural feature of many marshes (e.g. Zacharias & Zamperas 2010).
This action will usually involve some kind of water control structure: a valve, gate, sluice or pump. Water level management might aim to: mirror historical water level fluctuations or stability; manage salinity levels; increase sediment inputs; stimulate growth of desirable plant species; and/or create new wetland plant communities. Studies of “moist soil management”, “structural marsh management” and “environmental flows” along river courses all fall within the scope of this action. Caution: When managing water levels in a focal site, the effect on water levels in neighbouring sites should be considered.
Although water levels may be managed to restore or enhance habitats for waterfowl, information on the value of vegetation for waterfowl (e.g. seed production; productivity measured as CO2 exchange rates) is not summarized in this synopsis. Also, this synopsis does not include information on riparian areas that are not clearly marshes or swamps (e.g. riparian forests that require only a brief flood pulse for germination; Taylor et al. 2006).

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of active water level management in freshwater marshes. Eight studies were in the USA. One study was in Cameroon and one study was in the Netherlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that directly pumping water into drained marshes and wet meadows generated plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions. This change was reversed in some plots when the pump output was moved further away from the focal wetlands.
Relative abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study of freshwater marshes in the USA reported that irrigated and non-irrigated marshes supported a similar relative abundance of the most common plant species. One before-and-after study on a floodplain in Cameroon found that the relative abundance of some key plant species changed over four years after restoring wet-season flooding. There was also an increase in the cover of perennial relative to annual herbs.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): One before-and-after study of a marsh/swamp in the USA found that overall plant diversity was higher in the autumn following a managed flood/drawdown than in the autumn before. Two before-and-after studies of marshes and wet meadows in the USA reported that plant species richness and/or diversity declined over 5–6 years of water level management (fluctuation or water addition). One study in the USA simply reported the number of plant species that colonized a floodplain, over three weeks after lowering the river level.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): One study of riparian moist/wet meadows in the USA reported that vascular plant biomass increased in two of three meadow types, over the second year of artificially augmented streamflow. Meanwhile, vascular plant cover declined in two of three meadow types. Two studies in the Netherlands and the USA simply quantified overall vegetation abundance after 1–9 growing seasons of active water level management (sometimes along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant abundance (2 studies): Two before-and-after studies of marshes and wet meadows in the USA reported increases in abundance of some individual wetland- or habitat-characteristic species over 5–6 years of water level management (fluctuation or water addition).
Moss abundance (1 study): One study of riparian moist/wet meadows in the USA reported that moss cover did not significantly change in two of three meadow types, over the second year of artificially augmented streamflow. It declined in the other meadow type.
Individual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one before-and-after study of a marsh/swamp in the USA reported mixed effects of a managed flood/drawdown on species cover, including increased cover of Pacific willow Salix lucida and reduced cover of reed canarygrass Phalaris arundinacea. One controlled study of freshwater marshes in the USA found that irrigated marshes developed a greater biomass of pink smartweed Polygonum pensylvanicum, after one growing season, than marshes that were left dry.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Vegetation height (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study of freshwater marshes in the USA reported that four common plant species were taller in irrigated than non-irrigated marshes.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of active water level management in brackish/salt marshes. Six studies were in the USA. There was overlap in the sites used in two of these studies. Two studies were in Canada and based on the same experimental set-up. One study was in France and one was in Tunisia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One before-and-after study of a lakeshore brackish/salt marsh in Tunisia reported an increase in coverage of bulrush-dominated vegetation over nine years of freshwater releases into the lake (to increase its level and restore winter flooding of the marsh).
Community composition (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that artificially flooded marshes developed different plant communities, over five years, to fields with unmanaged flooding. One before-and-after, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that the overall plant community composition changed more, over four years, in a marsh directly irrigated with treated wastewater than in downstream marshes. One replicated, paired, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that that marshes in which water levels were drawn down each spring/autumn (along with disking soils) shared only 24–34% of plant species with marshes that were not drawn down (or disked).
Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies of brackish/salt marshes in the USA found that marshes in which water levels were managed (sometimes along with other interventions) had similar plant species richness and/or diversity to marshes without water level management. One replicated, site comparison study of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that marshes in which water levels were managed had similar or higher plant species richness, in winter, than marshes without water level management. One before-and-after, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that plant species richness increased, over four years, in marshes directly irrigated with treated wastewater – but only to similar levels as in downstream marshes. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effects of artificial flooding on plant species richness depended on whether the marshes were grazed.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that marshes in which water levels were managed typically had similar overall vegetation cover to marshes without water level management. One of the studies also reported that cover of standing dead vegetation was higher in the managed marshes than in the unmanaged marshes.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, four replicated, site comparison studies of brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported mixed effects of water level management on the abundance of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effects of artificial flooding on the cover of individual plant species depended on the flooding (and grazing) regime.

3042: Divert/block/stop saltwater inputs
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marshes and swamps may be threatened by inputs of the wrong type of water. This action involves limiting inputs of salty water to marshes or swamps of lower salinity. Clearly, this includes keeping brackish, saline and hypersaline water out of freshwater sites. Less intuitively, it might also be desirable to keep hypersaline water out of brackish or saline sites. Both inland and coastal wetlands can suffer from excess saltwater inputs. Chronic inputs may be related to groundwater extraction (causing subsidence of coastal areas), construction of canals (which allow salt water to penetrate further inland), elongation of tidal creeks, and global sea level rise (Wang 1988; White & Kaplan 2017). Acute inputs can occur during storms and tsunamis.
Specific infrastructure to divert or block water includes pipes, channels, waterways, pumps, impoundments, plugs or dams. Intervention may be permanent (e.g. blocking input channels) or temporary (e.g. diverting saltwater inputs during storm surges).
Caution: Diversions could shift the problem to another habitat: a suitable recipient habitat, where impacts will be minimal, should be chosen. Consider potential negative impacts of reducing water and sediment inputs to the focal marsh or swamp.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marshes and swamps may be threatened by inputs of the wrong type of water. This action involves limiting freshwater inputs to marshes or swamps, including (a) freshwater inputs to brackish or saline sites, (b) surface water inputs to sites normally fed by groundwater and (c) groundwater inputs to sites normally fed by surface water. Construction of pipes, channels, waterways, pumps, impoundments or dams can help to achieve these goals. Intervention may be permanent (e.g. blocking input channels) or temporary (e.g. diverting freshwater inputs during storms).
Stormwater might be deliberately diverted into wetlands. Otherwise, paved and tarmac surfaces in urban areas can increase the amount of runoff into neighbouring wetlands. Excess fresh water in brackish/saline marshes or swamps can alter the vegetation, including replacement of salt-tolerant plant species with freshwater species (Zedler 1983). Further, differences in temperatures, chemical composition and oxygen content between surface water and ground water can affect the type of plant communities that grow in sites fed by one or the other (Winter et al. 1999).
Caution: Clearly, diversions could shift the problem to another habitat: a suitable recipient habitat, where impacts will be minimal, should be chosen. Diverting freshwater inputs may deprive coastal marshes and swamps of the sediment they need to keep up with sea level rise (Ibáñez et al. 2010).
Related actions: Plug/dam canals or trenches (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps); Actively manage water level, including by adding fresh water (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Divert/block/stop saltwater inputs.

3044: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Mowing or cutting is one way to do this. This action includes machine mowing, hand clipping, strimming and scything of herbs or small shrubs, or swards of vegetation containing these types of plants.
Cutting itself may be the historic or traditional disturbance that maintains vegetation in a desirable state. For example, in Mexico’s Central Altiplano region, people have harvested marsh vegetation for millennia. Cattails and bulrushes are cut for crafts, construction, animal feed and fertilizer. This allows subordinate marsh plant species to persist (Hall et al. 2008). However, cutting activities may slow or cease as demand for the cut vegetation declines, skills are lost, or cheap imports reduce the economic viability of cutting (Clover 2002).
This action includes evidence for all forms of cutting/mowing in historically disturbed marshes, but bear in mind that the effects might be highly dependent on how the cutting/mowing is carried out (e.g. extent, timing, frequency and duration) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability and water levels) (Rolletschek et al. 2000; Russell & Kraaij 2008; Fogli et al. 2014).
Related actions: Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime; Cut large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing.

Key Messages:

Twenty studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. There were four studies in Belgium, three of which took place in one wetland area so probably shared some experimental plots. There were two studies in each of the UK, the USA and Estonia. There was one study in each of seven other European countries, Japan, Mexico and Brazil. In 15 of the studies vegetation was measured at least six months after the last cut.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (6 studies): Four replicated, paired, controlled studies (two also randomized and before-and-after) of freshwater marshes and wet meadows in Belgium, Switzerland, Mexico and Estonia reported that the overall plant community composition differed between cut and uncut sites after 1–5 years, or typically diverged in cut and uncut areas over 3–10 years. One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium reported that the overall plant community composition changed over seven years after resuming annual mowing. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany reported that over 20 years, mowing increased the average moisture preference of the vegetation.
Overall richness/diversity (11 studies): Seven studies (including two replicated, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK, Mexico and Estonia reported that cut marshes had higher plant species richness than uncut marshes. Two of these studies reported the same result for diversity. One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium reported that plant species richness increased over seven years after resuming annual mowing. Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in reedbeds in the UK and wet meadows in Germany and Estonia reported that cutting typically had no clear or significant effect on plant species richness, after 3–5 months or over 5–20 years. The two studies in the UK and Estonia found the same result for diversity.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a temporary marsh in France reported that two years of annual autumn cutting increased the number of habitat-characteristic plant species present.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized, paired, before-and-after) in freshwater marshes in the USA found that cutting had no significant effect on overall vegetation cover over 72 days or three years. One replicated, paired, controlled study in wet grasslands in Belgium reported that plots mown annually for two years contained less above-ground biomass, just before mowing, than unmown plots.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Germany reported that mowing increased sedge cover over 20 years, but had no clear effect on cover of rushes, forbs, ferns, grasses and legumes.
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a wet prairie in the USA found that cutting had no significant effect on woody plant cover: there were similar increases, over three years, in cut and uncut plots.
Bryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium reported that total moss cover increased over five years after resuming annual mowing.
Individual species abundance (15 studies): Fifteen studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK and the Czech Republic reported that common reed Phragmites australis was more abundant in cut than uncut areas. Two studies (one site comparison, one before-and-after) in fresh/brackish marshes in Belgium and Denmark reported that cutting reduced common reed cover or density. The two studies in Belgium reported that cutting had no clear effect on common reed frequency. Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after) in freshwater marshes in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan and Italy found that the effect of cutting on common reed abundance depended on factors such as the year, plant community type, cutting season, cutting intensity and time since mowing.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet meadows in Switzerland reported that mown plots experienced a shift in vegetation cover towards lower vegetation layers, over 3–4 years, compared to a shift to upper layers in unmown plots.
Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Belgium reported that summer-cut plots had lower horizontal vegetation cover than uncut plots (or winter-cut plots) over six years after resuming annual mowing.
Height (6 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies (one also randomized and paired) in freshwater marshes in Belgium, the UK and the USA reported that cut marshes had shorter vegetation than uncut marshes. This was true for vegetation overall, vegetation other than common reed Phragmites australis, and for common reed cut in winter or spring (but not summer). Two replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a marsh in Mexico and wet grasslands in Germany reported that cutting/mowing had no significant or clear effect on vegetation height, after 12 months or over 20 years. One site comparison study in the Czech Republic found that common reed was taller, when measured in the summer, in a winter-mown reedbed than in an unmown reedbed.
Diameter/perimeter/area (5 studies): Two studies (one site comparison, one before-and-after) in fresh/brackish marshes in Belgium and Denmark reported that cutting, or time since last cutting, had no significant or clear effect on the stem diameter of common reed Phragmites australis. Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) of reedbeds in the UK and the Czech Republic found that cut areas contained thicker reed stems than uncut areas, after one growing season. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet meadows in Switzerland found that the effect of cutting on common reed shoot diameter depended on the plant community type and season of mowing.
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study in a fresh/brackish marsh in Denmark found that the basal area of common reed Phragmites australis stems was smaller in a reedbed cut two years previously than in a reedbed cut seven years previously. Only “tall” stems were sampled.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wet prairie in the USA found that mowing had no significant effect on woody plant survival over the following year.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. Two studies were in France. There was one study in each of the USA, Denmark, South Africa and Estonia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that annual cutting affected overall plant community composition, with significant differences between cut and uncut plots after four years.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar overall plant species richness. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish wet grasslands in Estonia found that cut and uncut plots typically had similar plant species richness and diversity over four years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in France found that cut and uncut reedbeds had similar cover of plants other than common reed Phragmites australis.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies in brackish marshes or grasslands in South Africa and Estonia found that cutting had mixed effects on the abundance of common reed Phragmites australis after 1–4 years, depending on the water level of the plots. One site comparison study in Denmark found that a fresh/brackish reedbed cut two years previously contained fewer “tall” common reed stems than a reedbed cut seven years previously. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that cut reedbeds contained a similar number (and, in one study, biomass) of live reed stems than uncut reedbeds, but far fewer dead stems.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (4 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, before-and-after) in brackish marshes in the USA and South Africa reported that rushes or reeds were shorter in cut plots than in uncut plots, for up to one year after cutting. Two replicated, site comparison studies in France found that live reed stems were a similar height in cut and uncut reedbeds.
Diameter/perimeter/area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in fresh/brackish reedbeds in Denmark and France found that common reed Phragmites australis stems were a similar diameter in cut and uncut reedbeds. One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in a brackish marsh in South Africa found that cutting reduced the diameter of common reed stems present one year later.
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study in a fresh/brackish marsh in Denmark found that the basal area of common reed Phragmites australis stems was smaller in a reedbed cut two years previously than in a reedbed cut seven years previously. Only “tall” stems were sampled.

Disturbance can clear dominant plants (including trees and shrubs), maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost.
Large trees and shrubs may need to be managed by cutting individual plants, stems or branches with loppers, saws or chainsaws. These actions are the focus of this section.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. Three studies were in the USA. One was in Germany.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported changes in the area of plant community types over four years after cutting trees/shrubs (along with grazing).
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study aiming to restore freshwater marshes in the USA found that cutting trees (along with other interventions) significantly affected the overall plant community composition over the following five years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that plant species richness increased over four years after cutting trees/shrubs (along with grazing).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Of two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in the USA, one found that cutting and removing woody plants from a degraded wet prairie had no significant effect on overall vegetation cover three years later. The other study was in wet patches of a pine forest and found that understory vegetation cover increased more, over one year, where trees were thinned than where they were not thinned.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study of overgrown freshwater marshes in the USA reported that of 26 plant taxa that became more frequent after cutting trees (along with other interventions), 16 were obligate wetland taxa.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet patches of a pine forest in the USA found that cover of sedges Carex increased more, over one year, where trees were thinned than where they were not thinned.
Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of a wet prairie in the USA found that woody plant cover declined, over three years, in plots where trees/shrubs were cut – but increased in plots where trees/shrubs were not cut. One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany simply reported that some trees/shrubs regrew over four years after cutting trees/shrubs (along with grazing).
Individual species abundance (1 study): One study quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of a wet prairie in the USA found, for example, that cutting trees and shrubs had no significant effect on cover of the dominant herbaceous plant, tussock grass Deschampsia cespitosa, three years later.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that an area in which trees/shrubs were cut back (along with reinstating cattle grazing) contained shorter vegetation than an adjacent unmanaged area.

OTHER

Survival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wet prairie in the USA found that cutting woody plants did not significantly affect their survival in the following year. One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany simply reported that 20% of black alder Alder glutinosa trees were still alive after being cut back and grazed for four years.

3050: Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Grazing with animals such as sheep, horses, cattle, goats or water buffalo (Gulickx et al. 2007) might be one way to do this. Grazing can also give some economic value to wetlands, strengthening arguments against conversion to other land uses. Grazing itself may be the disturbance that has been reduced. Some wetlands have been abandoned following historical low-intensity grazing (e.g. Plassman et al. 2010).
This section includes studies evaluating the effects of grazing implemented for conservation (e.g. with species and intensity aligned with vegetation conservation goals). Studies of the impact of intense commercial grazing, for example, are not included. Bear in mind that the effects of grazing might be highly dependent on how it is carried out (e.g. species, intensity, timing, frequency and duration) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Rinella & Hileman 2009).
Related actions: Use grazing to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime; Change season/timing of livestock grazing; Change type of livestock grazing.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. Two studies were in the UK. There was one study in each of the Netherlands, Germany and the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (2 studies): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported changes in the area of plant community types over four years of grazing (after cutting trees/shrubs). One replicated, before-and-after study of dune slacks in the UK reported that the plant community type within plots remained stable over 16 years of grazing.
Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, studies in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the UK and the USA reported that the overall plant community composition was similar in grazed and ungrazed plots after 2–9 years. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply reported changes in the overall plant community composition after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two studies (one replicated, before-and-after) in wetlands in Germany and the UK reported that after resuming grazing (and cutting trees/shrubs in one study), there were increases in total plant species richness and/or diversity. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that grazing had no significant effect on overall plant species richness in wet grassland and flush vegetation: there were similar declines over nine years in grazed and ungrazed plots. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified total plant species richness over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in dune slacks in the UK reported that after resuming grazing, the number of dune-slack indicator species increased. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the richness of characteristic plant species – typical of dune slacks or nutrient-rich marshes – over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the USA found that grazing typically had no significant effect on overall vegetation biomass after 1–2 years. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified total vegetation cover over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions). Cover never exceeded 50%.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that grazing had no significant effect on the cover of forbs or grass-like plants in wet grassland and flush vegetation: there were similar declines over nine years in grazed and ungrazed plots.
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that some trees/shrubs regrew over four years of grazing (after cutting trees/shrubs).
Bryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK reported that grazing had no significant effect on bryophyte cover in wet grassland and flush vegetation: there were similar changes over nine years in grazed and ungrazed plots.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the cover of individual species present over three years after resuming grazing (along with other interventions). Only two species had &gt;1% cover in any slack.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): One site comparison study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that an area grazed by cattle (after cutting trees/shrubs) contained shorter vegetation than an adjacent unmanaged area. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet grassland and flush vegetation in the UK found that the maximum vegetation height was typically similar, over four years, in plots grazed by cattle and plots from which cattle were excluded.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One study of a riparian wet meadow in Germany reported that 20% of black alder Alder glutinosa trees were still alive after being cut back and grazed for four years.

3051: Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Grazing with animals such as sheep, horses, cattle, goats or water buffalo (Gulickx et al. 2007) might be one way to do this. Grazing can also give some economic value to wetlands, strengthening arguments against conversion to other land uses. Grazing itself may be the disturbance that has been reduced. Some wetlands have been abandoned following historical low-intensity grazing (e.g. Plassman et al. 2010).
This section includes studies evaluating the effects of grazing implemented for conservation (e.g. with species and intensity aligned with vegetation conservation goals). Studies of the impact of intense commercial grazing, for example, are not included. Bear in mind that the effects of grazing might be highly dependent on how it is carried out (e.g. species, intensity, timing, frequency and duration) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Rinella & Hileman 2009).
Related actions: Use grazing to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime; Change season/timing of livestock grazing; Change type of livestock grazing.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. The studies were in the UK, Denmark, France and the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the overall plant community composition diverged, over five years, in plots where grazing was maintained and plots where grazing ceased. The precise effect depended on the flooding regime.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study on a salt marsh in Denmark reported that an area where grazing was maintained had identical plant species richness, after six years, to an area where grazing had ceased. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that the effect of continued grazing on plant species richness depended on the flooding regime.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two controlled studies on salt marshes in the UK and Denmark reported that areas where grazing was maintained contained less vegetation overall, after 2–6 years, than areas where grazing ceased. This was measured in terms of biomass or cover. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that grazing had no significant effect on total vegetation biomass after 1–2 years.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study of brackish marshes in France reported that continued grazing strongly limited colonization by common reed Phragmites australis over five years.

3054: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Prescribed burns are one way to do this.
Fire itself may be the historic or traditional disturbance that maintains wetlands in a desirable state. Some wetlands, especially ones that dry out in summer, burn naturally every few years (Sutter & Kral 1994). In other wetlands, prescribed burns have been used by humans to manage vegetation (Middleton 2013). Reduced disturbance from fire in these systems – whether through abandonment or deliberate control of fire (e.g. via fire breaks or legislation) – can be detrimental to vegetation diversity, composition and structure (e.g. Clark & Wilson 2001).
Caution: Disturbance, and fire in particular, is not a natural feature of all wetlands. For example, even within the southeast USA, the natural fire frequency can vary from once per year to once per century (Sutter & Kral 1994). It can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of prescribed burns. Burns in winter or wet season, might be easier to control than burns in the summer or dry season. Smoke from prescribed burns could be detrimental to human health, especially near urban areas (Agee 1996). Also note potential impacts on animals within wetlands – but that some taxa might be unaffected or be able to avoid fire (e.g. Ditlhogo et al. 1992).
The timing and duration of monitoring might be particularly important when evaluating the effects of this action. Burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term, followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.
Related actions: Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime; Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Reduce intensity of prescribed burning; Change season/timing of prescribed burning.

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater marshes. Ten studies were in the USA. Two studies, based on one experimental set-up, were in the Netherlands. There was one study in each of the UK, Romania and South Africa.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (4 studies): Of four replicated, controlled studies (three also before-and-after) in freshwater wetlands in the USA, two found that burning (sometimes along with other interventions) significantly affected the overall plant community composition in the following 2–5 years. The other two studies found that burning had no clear or significant effect on the overall plant community composition over the following two years. One of these studies also found that the plant community in burned marshes was less similar to pristine local marshes than the plant community in unburned marshes, after two years.
Overall richness/diversity (8 studies): Four replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the UK and the USA found that burning had no significant effect on overall plant species richness and/or diversity over 1–2 growing seasons. However, three replicated, paired, controlled studies in the UK and the USA reported that burning increased plant species richness or diversity after 1–3 growing seasons. Two replicated studies (including one paired, site comparison) in the USA and South Africa reported that burning reduced plant species richness or diversity after 1–3 growing seasons. However, the study in the USA also reported that burning increased richness after 4–8 growing seasons.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (5 studies): Four studies (including two randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the USA found that prescribed burning had no significant effect on overall vegetation abundance (biomass or cover) after 1–3 growing seasons. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in the USA reported that burned plots contained less vegetation biomass, one year after the latest burn, than unburned plots.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study of overgrown freshwater marshes in the USA reported that of 26 plant taxa that became more frequent after burning (along with other interventions), 16 were obligate wetland taxa.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of sedge meadows in the USA found that burned meadows typically contained similar cover of herbaceous plant groups (grasses, sedges/rushes and forbs) to unburned meadows, after 1–8 growing seasons.
Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a degraded, shrubby wet prairie the USA found that over three years, burning reduced woody plant cover. One replicated, before-and-after study of freshwater marshes within a forest plantation in South Africa reported that burning never increased overall tree density five months later, although the precise effect apparently depended on site wetness.
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in the USA found that burned plots contained a greater abundance (cover and biomass) of surface-encrusting algae, over the following 72 days, than unburned plots.
Individual species abundance (9 studies): Nine studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The nine studies (including eight controlled or site comparison) in the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, Romania and South Africa reported mixed effects of burning on dominant herbaceous species, depending on the species, metric, site conditions and/or time after burning.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (5 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) – in reedbeds in the UK and Romania, a marsh in the USA and freshwater marshes within a forest plantation in South Africa – found that burned plots contained shorter vegetation than unburned plots in the subsequent growing season. One study in a marsh in the USA reported that over the 50 days after prescribed burning, the average height of sawgrass Cladium jamaicense increased.
Diameter/perimeter/area (3 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in reedbeds in the Netherlands and the UK found that common reed Phragmites australis stems were typically thicker in spring-burned plots than unburned plots, in the subsequent growing season. However, one site comparison study of reedbeds in Romania found that common reed stems were thinner in winter-burned plots than unburned plots, in the following spring.

OTHER           

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a degraded, shrubby wet prairie the USA found that woody plants had a lower survival rate, after one year, in burned plots than in unburned plots.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in brackish/salt marshes. Seven studies were in the USA. Two studies were in Argentina but based on the same experimental set-up. One study was in Guadeloupe.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina reported that burned plots had a different overall plant community composition to unburned plots, five months after burning. The same was true in one of two comparisons 17 months after burning.
Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, paired, controlled) in brackish marshes in the USA and Guadeloupe reported that burning had no significant effect on overall plant species richness, measured approximately 10 weeks to 2 years after the latest burn. In one of the studies, the effects of burning and legal protection were not separated. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish marshes in the USA reported that burning typically had no significant effect on changes in plant species richness over two years. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina reported that burned plots had greater overall plant species richness and diversity than unburned plots, 5–17 months after burning.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA reported that over three years after restoration – involving a prescribed burn along with restoration of tidal exchange – the number of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the number of freshwater plant species decreased.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (5 studies): Three replicated studies (one also randomized, paired, controlled) in brackish marshes in the USA found that overall vegetation biomass was lower in burned than unburned plots, 10 weeks or 1 year after the latest burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in alkali marshes in the USA found that a single prescribed burn had no significant effect on overall vegetation biomass: there was a similar change over two years in burned and unburned plots. One replicated, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in Argentina found that the effect of a single prescribed burn on the frequency of seedlings depended on the time since burning, but that seedlings were more frequent in burned than unburned plots after 9–12 months.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One study of a coastal marsh in the USA found that over three years after restoration – involving a prescribed burn along with restoration of tidal exchange – the cover of salt-tolerant plant species increased, whilst the cover of freshwater plant species decreased.
Individual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, five studies quantified the effects of prescribed burning on the abundance of dominant cordgrasses Spartina sp. in brackish and salt marshes in the USA and Argentina. Two replicated, paired, controlled studies found that cordgrass abundance (biomass or cover) was lower in burned than unburned plots, between 10 weeks and 17 months after the latest burn. However, one replicated, paired, site comparison study found that burning typically had no significant effect on cordgrass biomass or density after 2–8 months. One replicated, before-and-after study found that cordgrass biomass was lower, but cover greater, one year after burning than before. One study reported mixed effects on cordgrass cover across two marshes.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): Two studies (one controlled, one site comparison) in brackish marshes in the USA and Guadeloupe reported that the height of dominant grass-like plants was lower in burned than unburned areas for up to 1–2 years after the latest burn. The study in the USA reported recovery, to a slightly greater height than in unburned areas, after three years. The study in Guadeloupe also reported that the tallest trees in burned marshes were shorter than the tallest trees in unburned marshes.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance in freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Tree/shrub richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that shrub-dominated wetlands burned every three years contained fewer species of mature tree than unburned wetlands, but a similar number of shrub and sapling species.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of bottomland swamps in the USA found that swamps burned every 2–3 years had a similar overall density of midstory and understory vegetation to unburned swamps.
Herb abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of shrub-dominated wetlands in the USA found that wetlands burned every three years had greater cover of grasses than unburned wetlands, but statistically similar cover of forbs and ferns. Another replicated, site comparison study of bottomland swamps in the USA found that swamps burned every 2–3 years had a similar density of understory grasses to unburned swamps.

3057: Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Disturbance can clear dominant plants, maintain light availability and control nutrient levels – and may maintain vegetation in a desirable and/or species-rich state (Hall et al. 2008; Middleton 2013). Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Prescribed burns are one way to do this.
Fire itself may be the historic or traditional disturbance that maintains wetlands in a desirable state. Some wetlands, especially ones that dry out in summer, burn naturally every few years (Sutter & Kral 1994). In other wetlands, prescribed burns have been used by humans to manage vegetation (Middleton 2013). Reduced disturbance from fire in these systems – whether through abandonment or deliberate control of fire (e.g. via fire breaks or legislation) – can be detrimental to vegetation diversity, composition and structure (e.g. Clark & Wilson 2001).
Caution: Disturbance, and fire in particular, is not a natural feature of all wetlands. For example, even within the southeast USA, the natural fire frequency can vary from once per year to once per century (Sutter & Kral 1994). It can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of prescribed burns. Burns in winter or wet season, might be easier to control than burns in the summer or dry season. Smoke from prescribed burns could be detrimental to human health, especially near urban areas (Agee 1996). Also note potential impacts on animals within wetlands – but that some taxa might be unaffected or be able to avoid fire (e.g. Ditlhogo et al. 1992).
The timing and duration of monitoring might be particularly important when evaluating the effects of this action. Burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term, followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.
Related actions: Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime; Reduce frequency of prescribed burning; Reduce intensity of prescribed burning; Change season/timing of prescribed burning.

Therefore, conservationists sometimes want to actively restore disturbance where it has ceased, or maintain disturbance at a site where it would otherwise be lost. Applying herbicide might be one way to do this.
Bear in mind that the effects of herbicide might be highly dependent on the chemical used, how it is applied and local site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Tobias et al. 2016).
Caution: In many herbicides, the active chemicals are not specific to the problematic species so can cause collateral damage to desirable species. Relying on herbicides as the only tool to manage problematic plants can lead to the development of herbicide resistance in future generations (Powles et al. 1997). Herbicides can have severe negative side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use – particularly in or near wetlands or water bodies – is limited in many countries.
Related actions: Use herbicide to control problematic plants, whose success is not linked to a change in disturbance regime.

3062: Remove plant litter: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Accumulation of dead plant matter, or litter, can cause undesirable changes to marsh plant communities. Litter can affect temperature, light and nutrient availability (Weltzin et al. 2005) and act as a barrier to seedlings from below and seeds from above (Facelli & Pickett 1991). Litter removal may be necessary after abandonment or suppression of disturbance.
Caution: Litter accumulation is an important process in some wetlands, contributing organic matter to the soil. Where it is desirable to remove litter, removal by hand may cause less damage to soils and vegetation than using heavy machinery. Be aware that seeds of desirable plants may be removed along with the litter.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have examined the effect of litter removal alone (not, for example, the effect of removing litter from mown plots, or the combined effect of mowing and litter removal).
Related actions: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance and Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance, both of which could help to clear plant litter.

3066: Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the effects of different cutting/mowing frequencies, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve the target vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared cutting/mowing at different frequencies (e.g. 1 vs 2 cuts/year) but with the same intensity and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). For this action, “reduction” includes stopping disturbance altogether. However, studies comparing areas that remain uncut to areas that become cut, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reducing the frequency of cutting/mowing in freshwater marshes (or cutting/mowing them at different frequencies). There was one study in each of USA, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study of farmland ditches in the Netherlands found that marshy areas cut once, twice or three times/year had a similar overall plant community composition, when surveyed in July.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in farmland ditches in the Netherlands and wet grasslands in Belgium reported that overall plant species richness was similar in plots cut once or twice/year (and three times/year in the Netherlands).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of cutting twice/year (in July and October) on total above-ground biomass was intermediate between the effects of cutting once/year in July or October.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that cattail Typha spp. biomass was greater, nine months after the last cut, in plots cut every six weeks than in plots cut every three weeks. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in reedbeds in Italy found that common reed Phragmites australis biomass was similar in plots mown once or twice/year, when measured at least five months after the last cut.

3070: Change season/timing of cutting/mowing: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Cutting/mowing could have different effects on vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid disturbance when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the community. The season of disturbance can also affect nutrient levels and impacts to soils by trampling or vehicles.
To be summarized as evidence in this section, studies should have compared a fixed frequency and intensity of cutting/mowing, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of plants cut every summer vs 100% of plants cut every other summer).
Related actions: Change season/timing of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.

Key Messages:

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in wet meadows in Switzerland and farmland ditches in the Netherlands reported that cutting vegetation in different seasons typically had similar effects on the overall plant community composition, over 1–4 years.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in farmland ditches in the Netherlands found that marshy areas cut in May and areas cut in November typically contained a similar number of plant species, when surveyed in July. One replicated, paired, controlled study of wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of a single mow between June and November on overall plant species richness depended on the month of mowing.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study of wet grasslands in Belgium reported that the effect of a single mow between June and November on overall vegetation abundance (including litter) depended on the month of mowing.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The studies all reported that the abundance of some plant species responded differently to cutting in different seasons. The controlled, before-and-after study in Japan, for example, reported that cutting in June reduced the abundance of common reed Phragmites australis in the following summer more than cutting in July.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in wet meadows in Switzerland reported that summer-mown and winter-mown plots both experienced a shift in vegetation cover towards lower vegetation layers, over 3–4 years.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): The same study reported that summer-mowing and winter-mowing had opposite effects on the diameter of common reed Phragmites australis shoots: they became thinner over four years of summer mowing but thicker over three years of winter mowing.

3071: Change season/timing of cutting/mowing: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cutting/mowing could have different effects on vegetation depending on the time of year at which it is done. For example, it might be beneficial to avoid disturbance when certain plants are young/flowering so that they can grow/reproduce and contribute to the community. The season of disturbance can also affect nutrient levels and impacts to soils by trampling or vehicles.
To be summarized as evidence in this section, studies should have compared a fixed frequency and intensity of cutting/mowing, but in different seasons (e.g. summer vs winter) or in different temporal patterns (e.g. 50% of plants cut every summer vs 100% of plants cut every other summer).
Related actions: Change season/timing of vegetation harvest, including studies of cutting where vegetation is removed; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants.

Key Messages:

3072: Reduce frequency of prescribed burning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the effects of different prescribed burning frequencies, when the lower intensity may be suitable to conserve marsh or swamp vegetation. Different plant species have differing tolerance to disturbance, so the frequency and intensity of disturbance can affect the plant community composition (Connell 1978).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have compared burning at different frequencies (e.g. 1 vs 2 burns/year) but with the same intensity and with at least some overlap in the timing of disturbance (e.g. summer vs summer + winter). For this action, “reduction” includes stopping disturbance altogether. However, studies comparing areas that remain unburned to areas that become burned, at any frequency, are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Reduce intensity of prescribed burning;     Change season/timing of prescribed burning (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use prescribed fire to maintain or restore disturbance (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

3078: Thin vegetation to prevent wild fires
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an important disturbance in some marshes and swamps, whether it occurs naturally (Sutter & Kral 1994) or is prescribed by humans to manage the vegetation (Middleton 2013). However, if fire becomes too frequent or intense, or occurs at the “wrong” time of year, it can cause undesirable damage to these ecosystems. Fires within marshes or swamps can directly damage the vegetation and soils (Kotze 2013). Fires in the watershed can affect the water quality in focal marshes or swamps (Pinel-Alloul et al. 2002). It is possible to manage the frequency, intensity and timing of wild fires by removing/thinning the vegetation, thereby reducing the amount of fuel available (WRC 2000).
To be summarized in this action, studies could have compared areas or time periods in which vegetation has been thinned (using any method, including prescribed burning, within or adjacent to focal marshes or swamps) with areas or time periods in which vegetation was not thinned and experienced wild fire. The study must have monitored the vegetation, not just properties of the fire.
Related actions: Raise water level to prevent wild fires; Build fire breaks; Increase ‘on the ground’ protection for marshes or swamps, including fire fighting teams.

Fires within marshes or swamps can directly damage the vegetation and soils (Kotze 2013). Fires in the watershed can affect the water quality in focal marshes or swamps (Pinel-Alloul et al. 2002).
It may be possible to manage the frequency, intensity and timing of wild fires by raising the water level/table in focal marshes/swamps or surrounding areas. Wet soils or areas of open water can suppress fire. Caution: Restoring limited flooding to a site could actually increase fire risk by encouraging plant growth and thereby increasing fuel load during dry periods (Heinl et al. 2006).
To be summarized in this action, studies could have compared areas (or time periods) with high water tables and areas (or time periods) with low water tables and where wild fire occurred. Studies must have monitored the vegetation within marshes or swamps, not just properties of the fire.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Thin vegetation to prevent wild fires;     Build fire breaks;     Increase ‘on the ground’ protection for marshes or swamps, including fire fighting teams.

Fire is an important disturbance in some marshes and swamps, whether it occurs naturally (Sutter & Kral 1994) or is prescribed by humans to manage the vegetation (Middleton 2013). However, if fire becomes too frequent or intense, or occurs at the “wrong” time of year, it can cause undesirable damage to these ecosystems. Fires within marshes or swamps can directly damage the vegetation and soils (Kotze 2013). Fires in the watershed can affect the water quality in focal marshes or swamps (Pinel-Alloul et al. 2002).
Fire breaks could be constructed to completely exclude fires from marshes/swamps or nearby habitats, or restrict fires to certain areas. Fire breaks could be strips cleared of vegetation, strips of fire-resistant vegetation, embankments, empty ditches or water-filled ditches (Adinugroho et al. 2011). Caution: If left in place over the long term, fire breaks may pose a threat to marshes and swamps (e.g. ditches could act as drains). So, it may be desirable to dismantle them once the fire risk has passed.
To be summarized in this action, studies could have compared areas (or time periods) in which marshes or swamps were protected with fire breaks with areas (or time periods) in which they were not protected and experienced wild fire. Studies must have monitored the vegetation, not just properties of the fire.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
It is often cheaper and easier to prevent problematic species from being introduced to a site than trying to control them afterwards (Leung et al. 2002). This section includes all interventions aiming to directly prevent introductions of problematic species to marshes or swamps: from physical biosecurity measures like cleaning and drying equipment between sites, to legislative measures like banning the sale or ownership of problematic species. Caution: Bans on sale or ownership of problematic species may encourage mass releases into the wild (Hulme 2015).
To be included in this section, studies would have to evaluate the effect of biosecurity measures on wild marsh or swamp vegetation. This section does not include (a) studies only reporting the effects of biosecurity interventions on the problematic organism (e.g. mortality in laboratory tests), or (b) studies reporting changes in human behaviour after the introduction of biosecurity measures (e.g. uptake of biosecurity measures, or whether problematic species are still on sale).

3091: Physically remove problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action considers complete physical removal of problematic plants, i.e. pulling up or digging up entire plants, or scraping living vegetation from the marsh surface. Removal may be targeted to individual organisms, or applied to the whole plant community. The most appropriate removal method will depend on the species to be removed, and the site conditions (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016).
If plants are completely removed, including roots where applicable, immediate regrowth will be prevented (although long-term recolonization from the seed bank or from neighbouring sites is possible). For some species, disposing of the problem plants off-site may help to prevent regrowth, but disposal should be done carefully to avoid causing an invasion elsewhere (Stevens et al. 1997).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment, including any plants on it.

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically removing problematic plants from freshwater marshes. Three studies were in the USA, one was in India and one was in France. Two of the studies in the USA were in the same site and shared some plots.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that physically removing all vegetation from a cattail-invaded marsh altered the overall plant community composition, over the following two years.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that removing all vegetation from a cattail-invaded marsh increased overall plant species richness 1–2 years later. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in wet meadows in the USA found that physically removing vegetation had no significant effect on overall plant species richness or diversity three years later. One of the studies removed all vegetation, whilst the other controlled regrowth of the invasive species (by physical removal along with herbicide application).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a temporary marsh in France reported that stripping all vegetation increased the number of habitat-characteristic plant species present in the following two years.

Overall abundance (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies (two also replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in India and the USA found that physically removing vegetation had no clear or significant effect on overall vegetation cover, nine months or three years later. Two of the studies removed all vegetation, whilst one controlled regrowth of the invasive species (by physical removal along with herbicide application).
Herb abundance (2 studies): Of two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in loosestrife-invaded wet meadows in the USA, one reported that removing all vegetation increased the cover of grass-like plants, and reduced the cover of forbs, three years later. The other study found that controlling regrowth of the invasive species – by physical removal and applying herbicide – had no significant effect on cover of grass-like plants or forbs after three years.
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in India reported that removing all vegetation from a knotgrass-invaded marsh increased the cover of algae nine months later.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the target problematic species. For example, one before-and-after, site comparison study in India reported that removing all vegetation from a knotgrass-invaded marsh increased the cover of some other common herb species nine months later.

3092: Physically remove problematic plants: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action considers complete physical removal of problematic plants, i.e. pulling up or digging up entire plants, or scraping living vegetation from the marsh surface. Removal may be targeted to individual organisms, or applied to the whole plant community. The most appropriate removal method will depend on the species to be removed, and the site conditions (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016).
If plants are completely removed, including roots where applicable, immediate regrowth will be prevented (although long-term recolonization from the seed bank or from neighbouring sites is possible). For some species, disposing of the problem plants off-site may help to prevent regrowth, but disposal should be done carefully to avoid causing an invasion elsewhere (Stevens et al. 1997).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

3095: Physically damage problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Physical damage to plants may kill them directly, increase their susceptibility to disease, slow their growth and/or prevent reproduction. This section considers actions, other than cutting and mowing, that physically damage problematic plants. This includes crushing stems, removing seed heads and girdling trees (removing a strip of bark from the entire circumference of a trunk, stem or branch), as well as soil disturbance that damages the underground parts of problematic plants. Removing fragments of the damaged plants might be desirable to prevent regrowth.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants; Use cutting to control problematic trees/large shrubs; Remove surface soil/sediment; Bury surface soil/sediment or Disturb soil/sediment surface other than to control problematic plants.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically damaging problematic plants in freshwater marshes. There were two studies in Australia and two in Costa Rica. In each country, the two studies were based in one study area but used different experimental set-ups. The final study was in Mexico.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that crushing (and burning) cattail stands reduced the area of live vegetation present 5–22 months later.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a marsh in Costa Rica found that plots in which cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed had a different overall plant community composition, over the following 15 months, to plots in which vegetation was not crushed.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in one freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that in plots where cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed (sometimes along with burning), plant species richness and diversity were not lower than in plots where vegetation was not crushed (or burned). Vegetation was surveyed 2–22 months after intervention. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation increased overall plant diversity, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone. However, disking had no significant effect on plant richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that crushing (and burning) cattail stands reduced live vegetation cover 5–22 months later. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation typically had no significant effect on overall plant density, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported grass/sedge cover for up to four years after crushing mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Native/non-target abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a mimosa-invaded wetland in Australia reported that crushing mimosa stands did not reduce – and often increased – cover of non-mimosa vegetation one year later. One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported non-target vegetation cover for up to four years after crushing mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica found that plots in which cattail-dominated vegetation was crushed supported a greater abundance of individual plant species other than cattail, over the following 15 months, than plots in which vegetation was not crushed. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Mexico found that disking after cutting grass-invaded vegetation increased the cover of two of five common native plant species, after 4–8 months, compared to cutting alone.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically damaging problematic plants in freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that ploughing a canarygrass-invaded plot after spraying it with herbicide increased overall plant richness and diversity, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that ploughing a canarygrass-invaded plot after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant species richness, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): Two controlled studies in the USA evaluated the effects, on tree/shrub abundance, of physically damaging canarygrass-invaded vegetation. One study found that ploughing a canarygrass-invaded plot after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on the density of non-planted tree seedlings, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone. The other study found that managed plots (cut, disked and sprayed with herbicide) contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots, after 1–3 years.
Native/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that plots in which canarygrass-invaded vegetation was managed (by disking, along with cutting and applying herbicide) contained at least as much non-canarygrass herb cover, after 1–3 years, to plots in which vegetation was not managed.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA reported that ploughing a canarygrass-invaded plot after spraying it with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species – other than the target problematic species – two growing seasons later.

3099: Manage water level to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Temporarily increasing or decreasing water levels could help to control problematic plants in marshes or swamps. An elevated water table may kill upland plants that cannot tolerate long periods in saturated soils, or kill submerged plants by reducing the amount of light reaching them. Prolonged flooding, especially after another treatment like cutting or burning, may kill emergent vegetation (Hellings & Gallagher 1992). Lowering water levels may create exposed or dry soils, killing aquatic plants.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

3104: Use cutting/mowing to control problematic herbaceous plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Cutting or mowing refers to the removal of above-ground parts of herbaceous plants or young trees/shrubs. Roots are left in place. Mowing and cutting can be broad tools affecting all plants in a community, or targeted at specific problematic plants. Whilst cutting may not kill the targeted plants, it may weaken them and may provide desirable plants with an opportunity to grow and outcompete problematic plants. The cut plant material could be left on site or removed and used for construction or energy production, for example (Lishawa et al. 2015). Caution: Mowing with heavy machinery could damage wetland soil and vegetation. Cutting by hand or with specialized vehicles might cause less damage.
This action includes evidence for all forms of cutting/mowing to control problematic plants, but bear in mind that the effects might be highly dependent on how the cutting/mowing is carried out (e.g. extent, timing, frequency, duration, and whether cuttings are left in place or removed) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability and water levels) (Rolletschek et al. 2000; Weltzin et al. 2005; Russell & Kraaij 2008; Fogli et al. 2014).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants or small shrubs in freshwater marshes. Six studies were in the USA, one was in Mexico and one was in Canada.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a cattail-dominated marsh in the USA found that cutting altered the overall plant community composition over the following two years.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a grass-invaded marsh in Mexico found that cut and uncut plots supported a similar relative abundance of six common plant species after 4–8 months.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in invaded marshes/wet meadows in the USA found that cut plots typically had greater overall plant species richness and/or diversity than uncut plots, after 1–3 growing seasons. One of the studies carried out other interventions along with cutting. Two replicated, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Mexico found that cut and uncut plots had similar overall plant richness and/or diversity, after 1–2 growing seasons.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a reed-dominated freshwater marsh in the USA found that cutting/mowing (along with applying herbicide) increased non-reed species richness three years later. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA found that mown and unmown marshes had similar native plant species richness after 1–12 months

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Mexico found that cut and uncut plots contained a similar amount of vegetation after 1–2 growing seasons. This was true for cover of wetland plants and density of all plants. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in iris-invaded lakeshore marshes in Canada reported that cutting reduced overall vegetation cover, one year later, in a permanently flooded marsh but had no clear effect on cover in an intermittently flooded marsh.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a cattail-invaded wet meadow in the USA found that plots in which cattail was cut four times over two growing seasons developed greater cover of sedges Carex than uncut plots, but that cutting cattail only twice had no significant effect on sedge cover.
Native/non-target abundance (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired; one also before-and-after) in reed- or canarygrass-dominated wetlands in the USA found that cut plots typically contained more native or non-target vegetation than uncut plots, after 1–3 growing seasons. Both studies carried out other interventions along with cutting. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA found that mown and unmown marshes supported a similar native vegetation density after 1–12 months, and similar native vegetation biomass after 12 months.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. For example, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a grass-invaded marsh in Mexico found that five of five monitored native species had similar cover in cut and uncut plots after 4–8 months.

The cut plant material could be left on site or removed and used for construction or energy production, for example (Lishawa et al. 2015). Caution: Mowing with heavy machinery could damage wetland soil and vegetation. Cutting by hand or with specialized vehicles might cause less damage.
This action includes evidence for all forms of cutting/mowing to control problematic plants, but bear in mind that the effects might be highly dependent on how the cutting/mowing is carried out (e.g. extent, timing, frequency, duration, and whether cuttings are left in place or removed) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability and water levels) (Rolletschek et al. 2000; Weltzin et al. 2005; Russell & Kraaij 2008; Fogli et al. 2014).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Cut/mow herbaceous plants to maintain or restore disturbance; Reduce frequency of cutting/mowing; Reduce intensity of cutting/mowing; Change season/timing of cutting/mowing.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting/mowing problematic herbaceous plants or small shrubs in freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that mowing canarygrass-invaded vegetation before spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on overall plant richness or diversity, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that mowing canarygrass-invaded vegetation before spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant species richness, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA evaluated the effects, on tree/shrub abundance, of managing canarygrass-invaded vegetation by cutting. One study found that mowing canarygrass-invaded vegetation before spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on the density of non-planted tree seedlings, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone. The other study found that managed plots (cut, disked and sprayed with herbicide) contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots, after 1–3 years.
Native/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that plots in which canarygrass-invaded vegetation was managed (by cutting, along with disking and applying herbicide) contained at least as much non-canarygrass herb cover, after 1–3 years, to plots in which vegetation was not managed.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA reported that mowing canarygrass-invaded vegetation before spraying it with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species two growing seasons later.

3108: Use cutting to control problematic large trees/shrubs: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves cutting off above-ground parts of mature shrubs and trees: plants that are too large to mow. Note that vegetation may resprout from roots or stumps that are left in place. Cutting may be done manually or with machinery, depending on the species to be cut and the site conditions. Cuttings may be removed from the site, or left in place to rot down.
Locally, it may be desirable to remove all trees/shrubs from open marshes to prevent them from developing into swamps. However, note that encroachment of woody vegetation into marshes may be necessary for habitat migration and conservation of swamps at a regional or global scale (Saintilan et al. 2014). Within swamps, it may be desirable to remove individual trees/shrubs to maintain the vegetation structure or composition.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Cut/remove/thin forest plantations; Cut large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance; Physically remove problematic plants; Physically damage problematic plants, including by girdling large trees/shrubs.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting down problematic large trees/shrubs in freshwater marshes. One study was in the UK and one was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One study of a dune slack in the UK reported an increase in total vegetation coverage between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported a small increase in total plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported an increase in the number of slack-characteristic plant species present between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported an increase in native plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One study quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. The site comparison study in the USA found that tussock sedge Carex stricta was less dense in a wet meadow restored by removing trees (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that sedge tussocks were shorter in a wet meadow restored by removing trees (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): The same study reported that sedge tussocks had a smaller perimeter in a wet meadow restored by removing trees (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.
Basal area (1 study): The same study reported that the basal area of sedge tussocks was smaller in a wet meadow restored by removing trees (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.

3112: Use grazing to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves using herbivores such as sheep, cows, horses or fish to control problematic plants. Herbivores remove shoots or flowers, limiting plant growth and/or reproduction. They might selectively graze certain plant groups or species (Grant et al. 1987), creating space for other species to grow.
Grazing may be a useful option for control of problematic plants over large areas, or areas that are not easily accessible to equipment. To ensure grazing actually occurs in wetlands within the larger landscape, the breed or population of herbivores should be carefully chosen. Herbivores adapted to upland areas may avoid wetland habitats altogether. Caution: Trampling, erosion and nutrient enrichment from herbivores can have negative impacts on vegetation, especially if the density of herbivores is high.
Bear in mind that the effects of grazing might be highly dependent on how it is carried out (e.g. species, intensity, timing, frequency and duration) and site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, presence/density of wild herbivores) (Rinella & Hileman 2009).
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: interventions to address domestic livestock as a threat, e.g. Exclude livestock from historically ungrazed sites; Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using grazing to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. Two studies were in the USA. One study was in Costa Rica.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Costa Rica found that amongst plots where cattail-dominated vegetation had been crushed, grazing had no significant effect on the overall plant community composition over 15 months.
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a canarygrass-invaded marsh in the USA found that grazing had no significant effect on the relative abundance of the invader: over two years, it declined similarly in grazed and ungrazed plots.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Of three replicated, paired, controlled studies in invaded marshes/wet meadows in the USA and Costa Rica, two found that grazing typically had no significant effect on plant species richness and/or diversity over approximately two years. The other study found that grazed areas had higher plant species richness than ungrazed areas after two months.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a canarygrass-invaded marsh in the USA found that grazing had no significant effect on total vegetation cover at the ground surface, over two years.
Native/non-target abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in an invaded wet meadow in the USA found that two months of grazing increased cover of non-invasive grass-like plants.

3116: Use prescribed fire to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed burns can be used to manage problematic plants that may overgrow and outcompete desirable vegetation. By removing above-ground vegetation, fire can also be used to manage the physical vegetation structure (Flores et al. 2011). Prescribed burns may have only temporary effects: many plants can regrow from remaining stumps, roots or rhizomes (underground horizontal stems).
Potential benefits of management by prescribed burning should be weighed up against potential risks. For example, it can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of a prescribed burn: burning when the ground is wet and/or cold might be safer (Hackney & de la Cruz 1981). Burning can damage seed banks, and might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term followed by a rapid return to a degraded state. Burning can also damage the physical habitat (e.g. by exposing sediments, increasing erosion and reducing accumulation of organic matter; McKee & Grace 2012) and may be harmful to animals like amphibians (Smith & Sutherland 2014) and birds (Flores et al. 2011).
The timing and duration of monitoring might be particularly important when evaluating the effects of this action. Burning might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term, followed by a rapid return to a degraded state.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. Two studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Australia and Costa Rica.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that burning (and physically damaging) cattail stands reduced the area of live vegetation present 5–22 months later.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica found that plots in which cattail stands were managed (burned and physically damaged) had greater overall plant species richness than unmanaged plots, 11–22 months after intervention. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that the effect of prescribed burning on plant species richness in the following autumn depended on the season of burning.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that burning (and physically damaging) cattail stands reduced live vegetation cover 5–22 months later. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that the effect of prescribed burning on overall vegetation cover in the following autumn depended on the season of burning.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported grass/sedge cover for up to four years after burning mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Native/non-target abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in canarygrass-invaded wet meadows in the USA found that prescribed burning had no significant effect on the biomass of plants other than the invasive species, 2–3 growing seasons later. One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported non-target vegetation cover for up to four years after burning mimosa-invaded vegetation (along with other interventions).
Individual species abundance (1 study): One study quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. The replicated, randomized, controlled study in a marsh in the USA found that the effect of prescribed burning on the cover of dominant species in the following autumn depended on the season of burning.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed burns can be used to manage problematic plants that may overgrow and outcompete desirable vegetation. By removing above-ground vegetation, fire can also be used to manage the physical vegetation structure (Flores et al. 2011). Prescribed burns may have only temporary effects: many plants can regrow from remaining stumps, roots or rhizomes (underground horizontal stems).
Potential benefits of management by prescribed burning should be weighed up against potential risks. For example, it can be difficult to control the intensity, duration and area of a prescribed burn: burning when the ground is wet and/or cold might be safer (Hackney & de la Cruz 1981). Burning can damage seed banks, and might produce apparently desirable changes in vegetation over the short term followed by a rapid return to a degraded state. Burning can also damage the physical habitat (e.g. by exposing sediments, increasing erosion and reducing accumulation of organic matter; McKee & Grace 2012) and may be harmful to animals like amphibians (Smith & Sutherland 2014) and birds (Flores et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in brackish/salt marshes. All four studies were in the USA. Two studies were based on the same experimental set-up.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burned and unburned plots had similar plant species richness over the following 1–3 years. Two studies in saltgrass- or reed-dominated marshes in the USA reported that burned areas had greater plant species richness than unburned areas, after approximately 1–3 years. In one of the studies, burned areas had also been sprayed with herbicide for nine years – and contained more plant species than a nearby natural marsh.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA evaluated the effect of prescribed burning on vegetation cover. One study found that autumn-burned plots had lower overall vegetation cover than unburned plots after 11 months, but one found that winter-burned plots had similar overall vegetation cover to unburned plots after one year. Two of the studies reported that winter-burned plots had less standing dead vegetation cover than unburned plots in the following summer or winter.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): All four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than a species being controlled. For example, three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported mixed effects of burning on cover of saltgrass Distichlis spicata: higher in burned than unburned plots in the following summer, lower in burned than unburned plots in the following winter, or mixed effects amongst marsh types. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in the USA reported that burning did not reduce cover of saltmeadow cordgrass Spartina patens, compared to cover in unburned plots, over the following 1–3 years. One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh that had been burned for three years (and sprayed with herbicide for nine) contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than an unburned and unsprayed marsh, and a similar amount of smooth cordgrass to a nearby natural marsh.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in brackish and salt marshes in the USA found that the visual obstruction caused by vegetation (combination of height and horizontal cover) was similar in burned and unburned plots, after 11 months.
Height (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA found that in a marsh burned for two years (and sprayed with herbicide for nine), the dominant plant species (smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora) grew to a similar height as in a nearby natural marsh.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide increased overall plant diversity, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone. However, burning had no significant effect on plant species richness.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant species richness, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study aiming to restore a swamp in the USA found that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide had no significant effect on the density of non-planted tree seedlings, two growing seasons later, compared to spraying alone.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that burning canarygrass-invaded vegetation after spraying it with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species two growing seasons later.

3120: Use herbicide to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides can be applied to an entire area of vegetation, or targeted at individual problematic species (e.g. by painting onto individual plants, or shielding non-target vegetation). Herbicides could be applied once, or repeatedly to kill established vegetation or recurrent growth from the seed bank. To maximize contact with target species and minimize non-target effects, herbicides might be applied during/at the start of the dry season, as the tide is going out, or on calm rather than windy days (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016). Often, herbicide application will follow or be followed by other interventions, such as mowing, burning or physical removal of problematic plants.
Caution: In many herbicides, the active chemicals are not specific to the problematic species so can cause collateral damage to desirable species. Relying on herbicides as the only tool to manage problematic plants can lead to the development of herbicide resistance in future generations (Powles et al. 1997). Herbicides can have severe negative side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use – particularly in or near wetlands or water bodies – is limited in many countries.
Bear in mind that the effects of herbicide might be highly dependent on the chemical used, how it is applied (e.g. season and number of applications), and local site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, proximity of untreated invaded vegetation) (Tobias et al. 2016). Also, similarity between treated and untreated, degraded areas might not be an undesirable outcome for this action: similarity in vegetation cover after months or years could suggest, for example, that native vegetation abundance has recovered after being initially depressed by herbicide.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Use herbicide to maintain or restore disturbance; Introduce organisms to control problematic plants, including introduction of microorganisms as “bioherbicides”.

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using herbicide to control problematic plants in freshwater marshes. Twelve studies were in the USA. Two studies were in Australia. There was one study in each of Canada, Mexico and the UK. There was overlap in the sites used in two studies. Two pairs of studies in Australia and the USA used the same general study area, but different plots or experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Two replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after studies in the USA found that marshes sprayed with herbicide had lower live vegetation coverage but greater dead vegetation coverage than unsprayed marshes, after 1–2 years. Overall vegetation coverage was lower in sprayed than unsprayed marshes in one study, but similar in sprayed and unsprayed marshes in the other. One study of a dune slack in the UK simply reported an increase in overall vegetation coverage between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) in ephemeral marshes/wet meadows in the USA reported that spraying invaded vegetation with herbicide (sometimes along with other interventions) typically increased total plant species richness 1–5 growing seasons later. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies (one also before-and-after) in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the USA and Mexico found that plots treated with herbicide (sometimes along with other interventions) had similar overall plant species richness and diversity to untreated plots, after 4–8 months or three years. One study of a dune slack in the UK simply reported a small increase in total plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies of floodplain marshes in the USA reported that cover of wet-prairie indicator species was higher 1–4 years after applying herbicide than before. However, one of these studies reported that the total cover of non-invasive, wetland-characteristic herbs was similar or lower 2–3 years after applying herbicide than before. One study of a dune slack in the UK simply reported an increase the number of slack-characteristic plant species present between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).
Native/non-target richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled, before-and-after study in a reed-dominated freshwater marsh in the USA found that applying herbicide (along with cutting/mowing) increased non-reed species richness three years later. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA reported that marshes sprayed with herbicide contained no living native plants one year later: fewer than were present before spraying and in unsprayed marshes. One study of a dune slack in the UK simply reported an increase in native plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (by cutting and applying herbicide).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Three replicated studies (two also randomized, paired, controlled) in freshwater marshes/wet meadows in the USA and Mexico found that applying herbicide (sometimes along with other interventions) had no clear or significant effect on overall vegetation abundance four months to three years later. Cover and density were similar to untreated plots and/or pre-treatment levels. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that wet meadows sprayed with herbicide contained less total vegetation biomass than unsprayed marshes, 2–3 growing seasons later.
Native/non-target abundance (7 studies): Four studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in marshes/wet meadows in the USA and Australia found that spraying invaded plots with herbicide (sometimes along with other interventions) did not reduce – and often increased – the abundance of native or non-target vegetation 1–3 growing seasons later. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in cattail-invaded marshes in the USA reported that marshes sprayed with herbicide contained no living native plants one year later: density and biomass were lower than before spraying and in unsprayed marshes. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an alligatorweed-invaded marsh in the USA found that spraying vegetation with herbicide had no significant effect on native plant biomass after 1–2 growing seasons. One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported non-target vegetation cover for up to four years after treating mimosa-invaded vegetation with herbicide (along with other interventions).
Herb abundance (4 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in wet meadows in the USA found that treating a problematic plant species with herbicide (sometimes along with physical removal) had no significant effect on cover of forbs, grass-like plants or sedges after 2–3 growing seasons. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a loosestrife-invaded marsh in Canada found that the density of sedges and grasses was not lower in herbicide-sprayed plots, than in unsprayed plots, after 2–3 years. The precise effect depended on dose of herbicide used. One study of a floodplain marsh in Australia simply reported grass/sedge cover for up to four years after treating mimosa-invaded vegetation with herbicide (along with other interventions).
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a reed-invaded marsh in the USA reported that free-growing filamentous algae were more common in plots sprayed with herbicide than unsprayed plots, approximately one year later. However, spraying with herbicide had no significant effect on the density or biomass of biofilm algae.
Individual species abundance (3 studies): Three studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. For example, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a grass-invaded marsh in Mexico found that five of five monitored native species had similar cover in herbicide-sprayed and unsprayed plots after 4–8 months. Two of the studies do not distinguish between the effects of applying herbicide and other interventions.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using herbicide to control problematic plants in brackish/salt marshes. Six studies were in the USA. One study was in South Africa. Two studies shared part of the same experimental set-up.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA found that a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three) and a nearby natural marsh supported a similar relative abundance of the dominant plant species, smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three) contained more plant species than an unburned and unsprayed marsh – but also more plant species than a nearby natural marsh.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a pepperweed-invaded marsh in the USA found that applying herbicide did not increase the richness of non-pepperweed species over two years after intervention. The precise effect depended on the herbicide used. One study of an intertidal area in the USA simply counted the number of native salt marsh plant species that colonized after treating smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stands with herbicide.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Native/non-target abundance (5 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in pepperweed-invaded marshes in the USA found that applying herbicide typically did not increase cover of non-pepperweed vegetation, in the two years following intervention. The precise effect depended on the herbicide used. Two studies on the coasts of South Africa and the USA simply quantified the abundance of native salt marsh vegetation that colonized after treating smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stands with herbicide.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species, other than the species being controlled. For example, one site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA reported that a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three) contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than an unburned and unsprayed marsh, and a similar amount of smooth cordgrass to a nearby natural marsh. One replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a pepperweed-invaded marsh in the USA reported that applying herbicide typically reduced cover of dominant native species over two years. The precise effect depended on the herbicide used.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One site comparison study of brackish marshes in the USA found that in a marsh sprayed with herbicide for nine years (and burned for three), the dominant plant species (smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora) grew to a similar height as in a nearby natural marsh.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using herbicide to control problematic plants in freshwater swamps. All four studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study aiming to restore canarygrass-invaded swamps in the USA found that plots sprayed with herbicide typically had greater plant species richness and diversity than unsprayed plots, after 1–2 growing seasons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a petunia-invaded floodplain swamp in the USA found that plots sprayed with herbicide had similar overall plant species richness to unsprayed plots over 15 months after spraying.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies (also paired and/or randomized) in invaded freshwater swamps in the USA found that applying herbicide typically had no significant effect on native plant species richness, over 3–24 months after spraying.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA evaluated the effects, on tree/shrub abundance, of managing canarygrass-invaded vegetation by applying herbicide. One study found that plots sprayed with herbicide contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unsprayed plots, after 1–2 growing seasons. The other study found that managed plots (cut, disked and sprayed with herbicide) contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots, after 1–3 years.
Native/non-target abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in swamps in the USA reported that spraying invaded vegetation with herbicide (sometimes along with other interventions) typically had no clear or significant effect on native/non-target vegetation cover 1–3 years later. Cover was typically similar to unmanaged plots or before intervention.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study aiming to restore a canarygrass-invaded swamp in the USA reported that spraying the vegetation with herbicide affected the abundance of some individual plant species – other than the target problematic species – two growing seasons later.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides can be applied to an entire area of vegetation, or targeted at individual problematic species (e.g. by painting onto individual plants, or shielding non-target vegetation). Herbicides could be applied once, or repeatedly to kill established vegetation or recurrent growth from the seed bank. To maximize contact with target species and minimize non-target effects, herbicides might be applied during/at the start of the dry season, as the tide is going out, or on calm rather than windy days (e.g. Tobias et al. 2016). Often, herbicide application will follow or be followed by other interventions, such as mowing, burning or physical removal of problematic plants.
Caution: In many herbicides, the active chemicals are not specific to the problematic species so can cause collateral damage to desirable species. Relying on herbicides as the only tool to manage problematic plants can lead to the development of herbicide resistance in future generations (Powles et al. 1997). Herbicides can have severe negative side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use – particularly in or near wetlands or water bodies – is limited in many countries.
Bear in mind that the effects of herbicide might be highly dependent on the chemical used, how it is applied (e.g. season and number of applications), and local site conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, water levels, proximity of untreated invaded vegetation) (Tobias et al. 2016). Also, similarity between treated and untreated, degraded areas might not be an undesirable outcome for this action: similarity in vegetation cover after months or years could suggest, for example, that native vegetation abundance has recovered after being initially depressed by herbicide.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.
Related actions: Use herbicide to maintain or restore disturbance; Introduce organisms to control problematic plants, including introduction of microorganisms as “bioherbicides”.

3124: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Covers such as plastic sheeting, fabric sheeting, wood chips or straw mulch could be used to control problematic plants. These may act as direct physical barriers, temporarily covering the ground or water surface to prevent seeds from settling and establishing. Barriers could also be used to modify environmental conditions to the detriment of problematic species. Shading or opaque screens can limit photosynthesis. In areas where the sun is strong, black plastic placed on the soil/sediment surface can increase temperatures to kill problematic plants and their seeds (a technique known as solarization; Katan & DeVay 1991). Covers can be anchored underwater, if necessary.
Caution: Covers will also affect, and may kill, desirable plant species. Temporary application, when a site is most vulnerable to invasion by problematic plants, could solve this problem. Covers may need to be punctured to allow gas to escape.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

3128: Introduce organisms to control problematic plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves biological control: managing the abundance or distribution of problematic organisms via their enemies. Enemies of problematic plants could be disease-causing microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects, fish or even other plants (to compete with or parasitize problematic plants). Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002). Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016), and could damage non-target plants or restrict their establishment (Iannone & Galatowitsch 2008). Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have successfully introduced a biocontrol agent that persisted in the environment. The agent must have been introduced with a clear aim to control problematic plants.
For this action, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

3132: Exclude wild vertebrates: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Important wild vertebrates in marshes include mammals (e.g. deer, rabbits, hares, kangaroos, feral horses, feral pigs), birds (e.g. ducks, geese, swans), reptiles (e.g. turtles) and fish (e.g. carp). These animals can damage vegetation directly by eating it. They can also affect vegetation indirectly, for example by trampling, creating trails, digging, burrowing or defecation (Fuller 1985). Wild vertebrates could be physically excluded from pristine sites  to prevent damage, or from degraded sites to let them recover.
Caution: Disturbance from animals may be desirable in some habitats. It can help to control undesirable vegetation and maintain species richness or open water patches (e.g. Smith et al. 2012). Fences or cages can be expensive and require ongoing maintenance.
Although studies often intend to exclude a particular problematic species, other animals of a similar size will incidentally be excluded. Smaller animals such as insects can usually still access vertebrate exclusion plots. The benefits of this action may be highly dependent on the type/size of fencing used, and the abundance of problematic animals in the study site.
Related actions: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed marshes; Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed marshes; Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically excluding wild vertebrates from freshwater marshes. Six studies were in the USA. Three studies were in the Netherlands, two were in Australia and one was in Canada. The problematic vertebrates were birds in five studies, mammals in four studies, fish in one study, and mixed taxa in two studies. Two studies were conducted in the same area, but with different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in a freshwater marsh in Canada found that after two years of excluding common carp Cyprinus carpio, the area of emergent vegetation was similar to the area expected based on the water level and historical data (when carp were present).
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in Australia found that areas fenced to exclude wild mammals typically had a similar overall plant community composition to open areas, over 14 years.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Three replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA and Australia reported that fencing to exclude wild mammals had no clear or significant effect on total plant species richness. One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the Netherlands found that fenced plots had higher emergent plant species richness than open plots, but similar diversity.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (7 studies): Seven replicated, controlled studies (three also randomized and paired) involving freshwater marshes in the USA, the Netherlands and Australia found that areas fenced to exclude wild vertebrates contained at least as much vegetation as open areas – and typically more. This was true for biomass (fenced &gt; open in six of six studies), cover (fenced &gt; open in two of two studies) and stem density (fenced similar to open in one of one studies). Vegetation was monitored over the winter immediately after fencing, or after 1–4 growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (8 studies): Eight studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, seven replicated, controlled studies (four also paired, two also randomized) in freshwater marshes in the USA, the Netherlands and Australia found that dominant plant species had similar or greater abundance in areas fenced to exclude wild vertebrates, after 1–3 growing seasons, than in areas open to wild vertebrates. The dominant species included switchgrass Panicum virgatum, cordgrasses Spartina spp. and wild rice Zizania aquatica.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater marshes in the USA found that plots fenced to exclude Canada geese Branta canadensis contained taller wild rice Zizania aquatica than open plots in two of three comparisons. In the other comparison, after two years of goose control, fenced and open plots contained wild rice of a similar height.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of physically excluding wild vertebrates from brackish/salt marshes. Five studies were in the USA. The other studies were in France and Sweden. In five studies, the problematic vertebrates were mammals. In the other two studies, they were birds. Two of the studies were conducted in the same area, but with different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in brackish marshes in the USA found that fencing to exclude nutria Myocastor coypus had no significant effect on total plant species richness: fenced and open plots contained a similar number of plant species after 1–2 growing seasons. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in brackish marshes in the USA reported that excluding mammals typically had no significant effect on changes in plant species richness over two years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (5 studies): Five replicated, paired, controlled studies involving brackish marshes in France and the USA found that fencing to exclude medium-large vertebrates maintained or increased overall vegetation abundance. Vegetation cover or biomass were compared between fenced and open plots, after 1–2 growing seasons or over the winter after fencing.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. The six replicated, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in France, Sweden and the USA reported that fencing to exclude medium-large mammals typically maintained or increased the abundance of the dominant herb species over 1–4 growing seasons. Four of the studies found that fenced and open plots contained a similar abundance (biomass, cover or density) of cordgrasses Spartina spp. Three of the studies found that bulrushes Schoenoplectus spp./Scirpus spp. were more abundant in fenced than open plots. However, one study reported no clear difference in bulrush abundance between treatments and one study reported mixed effects depending on moisture levels and which mammals were excluded.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (3 studies): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a brackish marsh in France found that overall vegetation height increased over two years in plots fenced to exclude medium-large mammals, compared to a decline in plots left open. Two replicated, controlled studies in brackish and salt marshes in Sweden and the USA found that vertebrate exclusion did not reduce (i.e. maintained or increased) the height of dominant herb species over 2–4 growing seasons.

3135: Exclude wild vertebrates: brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Important wild vertebrates in swamps include mammals (e.g. deer, rabbits, hares, kangaroos, feral horses, feral pigs), birds (e.g. ducks, geese, swans), reptiles (e.g. turtles) and fish (e.g. carp). These animals can damage vegetation directly by eating it. They can also affect vegetation indirectly, for example by trampling, creating trails, digging, burrowing or defecation (Fuller 1985). Wild vertebrates could be physically excluded from pristine sites  to prevent damage, or from degraded sites to let them recover.
Caution: Disturbance from animals may be desirable in some habitats. It can help to control undesirable vegetation and maintain species richness or open water patches (e.g. Smith et al. 2012). Fences or cages can be expensive and require ongoing maintenance.
Although studies often intend to exclude a particular problematic species, other animals of a similar size will incidentally be excluded. Smaller animals such as insects can usually still access vertebrate exclusion plots. The benefits of this action may be highly dependent on the type/size of fencing used, and the abundance of problematic animals in the study site.
Related actions: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed swamps; Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed swamps; Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

3136: Control populations of wild vertebrates: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Important wild vertebrates in marshes include mammals (e.g. deer, rabbits, hares, kangaroos, feral horses, feral pigs), birds (e.g. ducks, geese, swans), reptiles (e.g. turtles) and fish (e.g. carp). These animals can damage vegetation directly by eating it. They can also affect vegetation indirectly, for example by trampling, creating trails, digging, burrowing or defecation (Fuller 1985). Reducing the local population of wild vertebrates (e.g. by scaring them away and/or killing them) could reduce their impacts and allow degraded sites to recover. It may be very difficult to completely eradicate animals that have refuges in nearby habitats.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have successfully reduced the local population density of problematic vertebrates. This could be done, for example, by killing them or by scaring them away.
Caution: These actions could directly affect non-target animals (e.g. if they consume poison by mistake) or might have knock-on effects for the rest of the food chain (e.g. less food for predators of the controlled animals; accumulation of poisons in predators; increased population of one problematic species after another, competing species is controlled; Corbett 1995). Herbivorous vertebrates, in particular, can be important in maintaining wetland vegetation, by controlling dominant species (e.g. black swans Cygnus atratus controlling sedges and maintaining open water; Smith et al. 2012) or by creating habitats on a large scale (e.g. marshes that develop on abandoned beaver Castor canadensis ponds; Wright et al. 2002). You should consider whether killing vertebrates is ethically acceptable. Scaring vertebrates away from a focal site could shift the problem to adjacent sites.
Related actions: actions to address the threat from domestic livestock, e.g. Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed marshes; Exclude wild vertebrates using physical barriers; Control populations of wild invertebrates.

3140: Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Although invertebrates such as insects, spiders, crabs and molluscs are an important part of marsh and swamp ecosystems, they can become problematic where they are introduced and/or become abundant. Invertebrates could be excluded from vegetation patches using mesh cages, or from individual plants using sticky materials painted on to stems.
We have not summarized the numerous fundamental studies testing the effects of invertebrate exclusion or removal on existing marsh or swamp vegetation: it is not clear that such small-scale manipulations are realistic practical conservation interventions. Many of these studies have demonstrated substantial effects, both direct and indirect, of invertebrates on vegetation (e.g. Tyrell et al. 2008; Bertness et al. 2014).
Related interventions: Exclude wild vertebrates using physical barriers (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

3141: Control populations of wild invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Although invertebrates such as insects, gastropods and crustaceans are an important part of marsh and swamp ecosystems, they can become problematic where they are introduced and/or become overabundant. For example, invasive scale insects Nipponaclerda biwakoensis are causing die-back of natural reed stands in the Mississippi River Delta (Knight et al. 2018). The golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculata can greatly reduce vegetation abundance (Carlsson et al. 2004).
Reducing the local population of wild invertebrates could reduce their impacts and allow degraded marshes or swamps to recover. Specific techniques might be spraying with pesticides, setting traps, introducing reproductively sterile individuals, introducing a natural enemy of the problem species, or increased harvesting. It may be very difficult to completely eradicate animals that have refuges in nearby habitats.
Caution: Actions to control invertebrates could have negative side effects. Pesticides will kill many non-target invertebrates. Organisms introduced to control problematic invertebrates could themselves become problematic. Reducing invertebrate populations could have knock-on effects for the wider community: invertebrates can be an important food source for predators, pollinators for plants, and competitors that prevent other species from becoming overabundant and problematic.
Related interventions: Control populations of wild vertebrates (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers.

Background information and definitions:
Waste water could be cleaned before it is released into the environment, or directly into marshes or swamps. Excess nutrients, salts, heavy metals, radioactive materials, organic compounds and solid waste should be removed. Acidity (pH) should be adjusted. Hot water should be cooled. Waste water can be treated through processes such as sedimentation or mechanical filtration, with bacteria or chemicals, or in ‘constructed wetlands’ that contain plants and microorganisms to absorb or break down pollutants (Kadlec et al. 2000; Siddiqui 2003).

3143: Divert/block/stop polluted water inputs
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves actions that divert or block polluted water (e.g. heated, or contaminated with excess nutrients or heavy metals) to prevent it from entering marshes or swamps, for example by constructing new pipes, channels, waterways, pumps or dams. Alternatively, pollutants could be collected at source: in India and the Philippines, specially designed toilets collect urine, which is then used as a fertilizer for crops instead of being released into natural systems (DWA 2015).
Care must be taken not to cause problems in another habitat by diverting polluted water there. Also, if water inputs are stopped, they may need to be replaced with a more suitable source to prevent the focal marsh or swamp from drying out.

3145: Retain/restore/create vegetation around freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Management of the watershed or catchment (the area of land which drains into a wetland) can be a critical part of wetland conservation.
Maintaining, restoring or creating vegetation in the watershed could reduce the amount of pollution reaching focal marshes (amongst other benefits; Ma 2016). Vegetated slopes or buffer zones may retain sediment and nutrients better than bare soil (Skagen et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2016). Perennial, deep-rooted plants in catchments can also soak up water and prevent salinization (due to rising water tables) in areas with salty soils (NSW Government 2019). Artificial wetlands may be built in the catchment of a focal marsh or swamp, and planted with vegetation that can remove or break down pollutants (Brix 2003). Vegetation could be retained around development, or could be introduced to degraded land around focal sites. Vegetation in watersheds could be carefully harvested, providing income to support conservation (Wantzen et al. 2006).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have reported the effect of vegetation near/around a focal marsh on the vegetation within the marsh. The surrounding vegetation may be permanent (e.g. planting forests) or temporary (e.g. planting cover crops in farmland). The scope of this action does not include (a) studies of water quality only, or (b) studies of the surrounding habitat, even if it is also a marsh, since this habitat is sacrificed to protect the focal site.
Related actions: Slow down polluted input water, other than with vegetation; Use artificial barriers to block pollution.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation in freshwater marshes, of retaining/restoring/creating vegetation around them. Three studies were in the USA and one was in China. Two studies were largely based on the same sites.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA reported that freshwater marshes surrounded by restored upland vegetation contained a different overall plant community, after 1–20 years, to nearby marshes surrounded by natural vegetation. One of the studies also reported differences between marshes in restored vs degraded catchments.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that marshes surrounded by restored upland vegetation had greater overall plant species richness than marshes within cropland, and similar richness to marshes within natural grassland. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that freshwater marshes surrounded by restored upland vegetation contained fewer wetland plant species, after 1–20 years, than nearby marshes surrounded by natural vegetation. One before-and-after study of a lakeshore marsh in China reported that after revegetating a polluted input river (along with planting directly into the marsh), overall plant species richness increased.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that marshes surrounded by restored upland vegetation contained more plant biomass than marshes within cropland, but also more plant biomass than marshes within natural grassland.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that marshes surrounded by restored upland vegetation typically had greater cover of wetland-characteristic plants than marshes within cropland, and similar cover of these species to marshes within natural grassland.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of pothole wetlands the USA found that wetlands surrounded by restored upland vegetation had greater cover of hybrid cattail Typha x glauca, after 2–7 years, than nearby natural wetlands.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of pothole wetlands in the USA found that parts of wetlands surrounded by restored upland vegetation created more visual obstruction, after 2–7 years, than the corresponding zone of nearby natural wetlands.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Management of the watershed or catchment (the area of land which drains into a wetland) can be a critical part of wetland conservation.
Maintaining, restoring or creating vegetation in the watershed could reduce the amount of pollution reaching focal swamps (amongst other benefits; Ma 2016). Vegetated slopes or buffer zones may retain sediment and nutrients better than bare soil (Skagen et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2016). Perennial, deep-rooted plants in catchments can also soak up water and prevent salinization (due to rising water tables) in areas with salty soils (NSW Government 2019). Artificial wetlands may be built in the catchment of a focal marsh or swamp, and planted with vegetation that can remove or break down pollutants (Brix 2003). Vegetation could be retained around development, or could be introduced to degraded land around focal sites. Vegetation in watersheds could be carefully harvested, providing income to support conservation (Wantzen et al. 2006).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have reported the effect of vegetation near/around a focal swamp on the vegetation within the swamp. The surrounding vegetation may be permanent (e.g. planting forests) or temporary (e.g. planting cover crops in farmland). The scope of this action does not include (a) studies of water quality only, or (b) studies of the surrounding habitat, even if it is also a swamp, since this habitat is sacrificed to protect the focal site.

3149: Use artificial barriers to block pollution
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial barriers such as sand bags, rocks, temporary berms, bundles of sticks, plastic curtains, booms, absorbent matting or ditches could be used to block out pollution from a focal marsh or swamp. Barriers can isolate pollution and prevent it reaching the site at all, or slow it down so it has time to break down before reaching the focal site. Barriers are likely to be most effective as a short-term intervention to extreme pollution events e.g. oil or chemical spills (Hoff & Michel 2014). In 2010, over 20 km of sand berms were built to protect coastal marshes in Louisiana from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Martínez et al. 2012). In Australia, temporary banks or flow regulators are used to contain the acid water and toxic metals released when acid sulfate soils are rewetted (Baldwin 2011).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have evaluated the effect of barriers on marsh or swamp vegetation – not just the effectiveness of barriers for isolating pollutants.

3150: Add clean water to reduce pollution
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Diverting non-polluted water into marshes or swamps when they are risk of pollution events may help to prevent pollutants from entering at all. For example, in April 2010, floodgates into the Barataria Bay and Breton Sound basins were opened to increase freshwater flows in an attempt to prevent oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill from entering coastal marshes in Louisiana (Martínez et al. 2012). Clean water could also be used to dilute or flush out pollutants that have already entered marshes or swamps.
Caution: Increasing freshwater inputs will reduce the salinity, which may affect vegetation and other organisms. High flow rates may cause erosion. Diluting pollutants with clean water may reduce concentrations without affecting the total amount entering a focal site.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have evaluated the effect of water diversions on marsh or swamp vegetation – not just their effectiveness at reducing pollution.
Related actions: Use artificial barriers to block pollution.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves introducing vegetation into polluted marshes or swamps, with the intention that the introduced plants help to control pollution (Bert et al. 2009). Plants can help to clean up existing pollutants, or manage chronic inputs of pollutants. Plants may directly absorb or break down pollutants, or facilitate break down by microbes through providing oxygen and a large surface area (Brix 2003). To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must report effects on desirable marsh or swamp vegetation other than that planted to control pollution.
Related actions: Retain/restore/create vegetation around focal site, including in waterways (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Stimulate microbial breakdown of oil.

3152: Reduce fertilizer or herbicide use: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
An excess of fertilizers and herbicides can have negative effects on vegetation. Herbicides can kill plants directly. An excess of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, can alter the competitive balance leading to domination by single species (Tilman et al. 1999) or algal blooms (Smith et al. 2006). For many marshes, problems are related to chronic spillover of chemicals from agricultural or domestic land. Nutrient pollution is especially severe where a large proportion of the land is cultivated, e.g. in Europe, eastern North America and southeast China (Verhoeven et al. 2006). In some cases, e.g. rice paddies, excess chemical application could affect vegetation during the growing season and/or fallow periods.
Simply applying less fertilizer or herbicide to land/water near focal sites, or to agricultural wetlands, could reduce these problems. Ultimately, reduced application could be driven by legislation, financial incentives and/or education. Studies of organic farming – an agricultural system that minimizes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost and biological pest control (European Commission 2019) – are included within this action.
For this action, “reduction” includes stopping fertilizer or herbicide treatments altogether. Note that studies comparing areas that remain untreated to areas that become treated are not summarized as evidence for this action.
Related actions: Manage fertilizer or herbicide application, without reducing the total amount applied. In practice, that action and the current one will often be used simultaneously.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation in freshwater marshes, of reducing the amount of fertilizer or herbicide used in the marshes or adjacent areas. The study was in Brazil.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of rice fields in Brazil found that the overall plant community composition (excluding rice) was similar in organically farmed fields and conventionally farmed fields, but different from the community in nearby natural marshes.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that organically farmed rice fields contained a similar average richness and diversity of wetland plants (at any single point in time) to conventionally farmed rice fields, although more species were recorded in the organic fields over the year of the study. Organically farmed rice fields had lower wetland plant richness and diversity than nearby natural marshes.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of rice fields in Brazil found that organically farmed fields contained more wetland plant biomass than conventionally farmed fields over the year of the study, but less wetland plant biomass than nearby natural marshes.

Various techniques could be used to reduce these problems, without reducing the overall amount applied (although this could also be beneficial; Section 10.6). Applying fertilizers when plants are actively growing means a greater proportion of the nutrients are taken up by the plants. Within watersheds, avoiding application before heavy rain reduces the amount that is immediately washed away. Ultimately, better chemical management could be driven by legislation, financial incentives and/or education.
Related actions: Reduce fertilizer or herbicide use, without other management of its application (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps). In practice, that action and the current one will often be used simultaneously.

3157: Add lime or similar chemicals: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Wetlands can become acidified through processes such as:

deposition of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the air. These originate from a range of man-made sources, e.g. transport exhausts and gas flaring on oil wells (Uyigue & Agho 2007).
exposure of acid sulfate soils to oxygen, for example through drought, drainage or dredging. These soils are present in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (Dent 1986) and salinized inland areas (Baldwin 2011).
inflows of acidic waste water from mining operations, for example in the Odiel Marshes, southwest Spain (Davila et al. 2019). This is formed when metal sulfide minerals, exposed during mining, react with oxygen.

Acidity can be reduced with calcium and/or magnesium-rich substances, such as lime CaO or Ca(OH)2, limestone CaCO3, magnesium oxide MgO, fly ash (residue from burning coal) or biochar (a type of charcoal). Adding these chemicals can also affect nutrient availability, because nutrients such as phosphorous become locked away in acidic soils or sediments (Weil & Brady 2016).
Neutralizing chemicals might be added directly to a focal site, added to an adjacent water body, or applied elsewhere in the watershed (which may reduce negative impacts on water quality associated with direct addition; Dorland et al. 2005).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to freshwater marshes or their catchments. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of marsh vegetation in the USA found that liming had little effect on the relative abundance of plant taxa. For 48 of 49 taxa, differences or similarities in relative abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study of marsh vegetation in the USA found that for most plant taxa, differences or similarities in abundance between limed and unlimed areas before intervention persisted over two years following intervention. This was true for 33 of 38 herbaceous plant taxa, eight of eight woody plant taxa, and two of three moss taxa.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wetlands can become acidified through processes such as:

deposition of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the air. These originate from a range of man-made sources, e.g. transport exhausts and gas flaring on oil wells (Uyigue & Agho 2007).
exposure of acid sulfate soils to oxygen, for example through drought, drainage or dredging. These soils are present in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (Dent 1986) and salinized inland areas (Baldwin 2011).
inflows of acidic waste water from mining operations, for example in the Odiel Marshes, southwest Spain (Davila et al. 2019). This is formed when metal sulfide minerals, exposed during mining, react with oxygen.

Acidity can be reduced with calcium and/or magnesium-rich substances, such as lime CaO or Ca(OH)2, limestone CaCO3, magnesium oxide MgO, fly ash (residue from burning coal) or biochar (a type of charcoal). Adding these chemicals can also affect nutrient availability, because nutrients such as phosphorous become locked away in acidic soils or sediments (Weil & Brady 2016).
Neutralizing chemicals might be added directly to a focal site, added to an adjacent water body, or applied elsewhere in the watershed (which may reduce negative impacts on water quality associated with direct addition; Dorland et al. 2005).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing debris from brackish/salt marshes. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a salt marsh in the USA found that overall vegetation cover in patches where debris had been removed remained lower than in undisturbed marsh for one growing season, but had recovered to match undisturbed marsh after two growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, the two replicated, site comparison studies in salt marshes in the USA found that the abundance of dominant herb species in impacted vegetation patches was typically lower than in undisturbed marsh one growing season after removing debris, but was sometimes similar to undisturbed marsh. The results depended on the species, metric and type of debris removed. One of the studies also monitored until the second growing season after removing debris; at this point, the cover of both dominant herb species had recovered to match undisturbed marsh.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in a salt marsh in the USA found that the maximum height of smooth cordgrass recovered, to match undisturbed marsh, within 45 weeks of removing debris.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Signs may be erected in/around marshes or swamps to discourage casual littering or large-scale waste dumping (Korb 2018). Solid waste can smother or physically damage vegetation, especially herbs and young plants. Anti-littering notices may or may not have a legal basis (i.e. littering/dumping may or may not be illegal). They may be included as part of general information boards.
Although we found no studies evaluating the effects of this action in marshes or swamps, more general psychological studies suggest a combination of anti-littering signs but the presence of litter – suggesting other people have ignored the sign – can actually make people more likely to litter (Keizer et al. 2011).

3166: Modify crop farming practices in watershed to reduce pollution: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Crop farming in watersheds can lead to pollution of focal marshes. Soil and nutrients can run off arable land and accumulate in wetlands, affecting the plant community composition, plant diversity and distribution of plant species (Verhoeven et al. 2006; Bromberg Gedan et al. 2009). Extreme excesses can cause algal blooms or even fill in wetlands (Gleason & Euliss Jr. 1998). Crop farming can also contribute to salinization and acidification, by raising the local water table and bringing salts to the surface. This can occur through (a) excess irrigation or (b) replacing native, perennial deep-rooted vegetation with shallow-rooted, temporary crops that don’t take up as much water (NSW Government 2019). Alternatively, runoff of excess fresh irrigation water can pollute brackish/saline sites (Zedler 1983).
This action includes a range of specific management techniques, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use that are considered as separate actions, that might reduce pollution from arable farming in wetland catchments. For example, ploughing or harrowing parallel to slopes avoids creating channels that carry soil and nutrients. Terraces may help to retain soil and nutrients. Minimizing the number/duration of fallow periods, and planting cover crops during them, could minimize sediment/chemical runoff and infiltration of water. Water table rise could also be reduced by tailoring irrigation to the needs of crops, increasing irrigation efficiency (e.g. replacing leaking pipes) and installing systems to retain excess irrigation water on site (NSW Government 2019).

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by abandoning cropland in the watershed (along with removing topsoil from the marshes) contained a different overall plant community, after 1–12 years, to both natural and degraded marshes nearby.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that freshwater marshes being restored by abandoning cropland in the watershed (along with removing topsoil from the marshes) contained fewer wetland plant species, after 1–12 years, than nearby natural marshes.

Soil and nutrients can run off arable land and accumulate in wetlands, affecting the plant community composition, plant diversity and distribution of plant species (Verhoeven et al. 2006; Bromberg Gedan et al. 2009). Extreme excesses can cause algal blooms or even fill in wetlands (Gleason & Euliss Jr. 1998). Crop farming can also contribute to salinization and acidification, by raising the local water table and bringing salts to the surface. This can occur through (a) excess irrigation or (b) replacing native, perennial deep-rooted vegetation with shallow-rooted, temporary crops that don’t take up as much water (NSW Government 2019). Alternatively, runoff of excess fresh irrigation water can pollute brackish/saline sites (Zedler 1983).
This action includes a range of specific management techniques, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use that are considered as separate actions, that might reduce pollution from arable farming in wetland catchments. For example, ploughing or harrowing parallel to slopes avoids creating channels that carry soil and nutrients. Terraces may help to retain soil and nutrients. Minimizing the number/duration of fallow periods, and planting cover crops during them, could minimize sediment/chemical runoff and infiltration of water. Water table rise could also be reduced by tailoring irrigation to the needs of crops, increasing irrigation efficiency (e.g. replacing leaking pipes) and installing systems to retain excess irrigation water on site (NSW Government 2019).

3170: Modify logging practices in watershed to reduce pollution
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
High intensity logging within watersheds – when a large proportion of the trees are removed, or trees are removed frequently – can cause pollution problems in marshes or swamps below. Erosion and landslides following logging activity can increase sediment loads, reducing water clarity or even filling wetlands completely (Lele 2009; Adamus 2014).
This action includes a range of specific actions, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use, that might reduce pollution from logging in wetland catchments. Logging less frequently or less intensely would leave more trees to intercept rainfall and hold together the soil, reducing sediment run-off. Additionally, any logging that is carried out could follow low-impact principles such as planning vehicle extraction routes, extraction of timber by helicopter, and directional felling.
Related actions: Reduce frequency of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Reduce intensity of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Change season/timing of vegetation harvest within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Use low-impact methods to harvest vegetation within freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps;     Reduce fertilizer or herbicide use (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Manage fertilizer or herbicide application.

3171: Modify livestock farming practices in watershed to reduce pollution
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Livestock farming in watersheds can lead to pollution of focal marshes or swamps. Soil and nutrients can run off arable land and accumulate in wetlands, affecting the plant community composition, plant diversity and distribution of plant species (Meehan & Platts 1978; Verhoeven et al. 2006; Bromberg Gedan et al. 2009). Extreme excesses can cause algal blooms. Runoff is a particular problem on farmland that has been compacted due to trampling. Conversion of catchments to pastures also contributes to salinization and acidification, by raising the local water table and bringing salts to the surface. The main cause of this is the replacement of native deep-rooted vegetation with shallow-rooted pasture crops that don’t take up as much water – made worse if overgrazing stunts plant growth or creates bare patches (NSW Government 2019).
This action includes a range of specific actions, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use, that might reduce pollution from livestock farming in wetland catchments. These interventions include: completely excluding or removing livestock, reducing grazing intensity (by reducing duration and/or pressure of grazing), changing timing of grazing (e.g. avoiding grazing just before heavy rains) and changing the type of livestock (e.g. using sheep or goats rather than cattle if trampling is a problem). Studies in which livestock have access to marshes or swamps, and can graze directly within them, are considered in Chapter 3.
Related actions: actions to address the threat from livestock within wetlands, e.g. Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed sites (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Reduce fertilizer or herbicide use (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Manage fertilizer or herbicide application.

3172: Modify aquaculture practices in watershed to reduce pollution
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Nutrients from aquaculture stock can spill over into focal marshes or swamps, causing pollution problems. This includes nutrients in excretory products from the animals themselves, as well as in excess food (Dauda et al. 2019). An excess of nutrients in marshes and swamps can affect the plant community composition, plant diversity and distribution of plant species (Verhoeven et al. 2006; Bromberg Gedan et al. 2009). Extreme excesses can cause algal blooms.
This action includes a range of specific management techniques, other than changes in fertilizer or herbicide use, that might reduce pollution in focal marshes or swamps from aquacultural facilities elsewhere in the catchments. These interventions include: completely excluding or removing stock, reducing aquacultural intensity (by reducing frequency and/or degree of stocking), or better management of feed (altering the amount and/or timing).
Related actions: Abandon aquaculture facilities within focal wetlands (freshwater – brackish/saline).

3173: Physically or chemically remove oil
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can damage vegetation in marshes and swamps. Lighter oils can kill plants through their toxic effects, whilst heavier oils coat and smother vegetation (Michel & Rutherford 2013). Coastal salt marshes and mangroves are vulnerable to offshore tanker spillages. An estimated 5.5 million tonnes of oil has been released into mangrove-lined coastal waters around the world since 1958, killing at least 126,000 ha of mangrove vegetation (Duke 2016). Oil pipelines crossing inland marshes or swamps (e.g. the Russia-China Oil Pipeline; Yu et al. 2010) pose a threat from leaks and malfunctions. Loss of vegetation can increase the risk of erosion and permanent habitat loss (Beland et al. 2017; https://youtu.be/UkATPicHIo4).
This action includes a range of specific actions that directly remove or break down oil, such as picking up lumps of oil, removing oil-contaminated litter/wrack/sediment, vacuuming, washing, sand-blasting, using chemical cleaners, and adding chemical dispersants. For more information about implementing these techniques, see ExxonMobil (2008), Michel & Rutherford (2013) and Hoff & Michel (2014). The effectiveness of these actions may depend on the type of oil, exposure to waves and currents, climate, time of year that the spill occurred, and the species involved (Michel & Rutherford 2014). Caution: Interventions to remove oil could kill any surviving vegetation and churn oil into the sediment, potentially hindering long-term recovery.
Related actions: Use artificial barriers to block pollution;     Cut or burn oil-contaminated vegetation (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Stimulate microbial breakdown of oil.

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of cutting or burning oil-contaminated vegetation in brackish/salt marshes. One study reviewed multiple cases from the UK and the USA. The other study was in Brazil.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One review of studies in oil-contaminated salt marshes in the UK and the USA reported that in eight of eight cases with quantitative comparisons between cut and uncut areas, cutting had no clear benefit for vegetation abundance (density, biomass or cover) over 8–29 months of recovery.
Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, site comparison study in oil-contaminated brackish/salt marshes in Brazil found that smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora density and biomass were never greater in cut than uncut plots (and typically similar under each treatment), over nine months after cutting.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled, site comparison study in oil-contaminated brackish/saline marshes in Brazil found that smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora was never taller in cut than uncut plots (typically similar height under each treatment) over nine months after cutting.

Atmospheric pollutants can be removed from waste gases (e.g. from industry or transport) before they enter the environment. Physical or electrostatic filters can trap dust and ash particles. Sulfur dioxide can be removed by spraying alkaline substances, such as seawater, into waste gases. Reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants may prevent damage to marsh or swamp vegetation, or allow it to recover. Ultimately, efforts to clean up waste gases may be driven by legislation or financial incentives.

3180: Add water to marshes or swamps to compensate for drought
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Water may be added to marshes or swamps to compensate for meteorological drought: periods of water shortage linked to below-average precipitation. Long periods with dry soils, which may be accompanied by increases in salinity, can kill or change the composition of vegetation (e.g. Visser et al. 2002). Water may be added to a site for weeks, months or years, depending on the duration of the drought. Longer periods of water additions are less likely to be sustainable, both financially and in terms of damage to other ecosystems which may be deprived of water. Caution: The added water must be of a suitable chemical composition for the target habitat (e.g. correct pH and salinity and not excessively polluted). Consider that adding water to a focal site could deprive habitats elsewhere.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Actively manage water level (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

3181: Build barriers to protect littoral freshwater marshes from rising water levels and severe weather
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Littoral wetlands (on sea or lake shores) are vulnerable to physical damage from strong waves, and from excessive flooding linked to storm surges and rising water levels. These threats may be reduced by building barriers such as dykes, walls, breakwaters, reefs, groynes, coconut-fibre rolls or even additional marshes or swamps. Barriers can provide some immediate shelter from wave energy. They can also encourage sediment deposition, potentially helping existing marshes or swamps to keep up with sea level rise or building a surface at suitable elevation for emergent vegetation (Wetlands International 2016). Barriers could be installed temporarily to protect colonizing vegetation, or could be used as permanent protection.
Caution: Littoral areas are naturally exposed to wind, waves and flooding. Some disturbance from these elements may be necessary to maintain a diversity of coastal habitats and normal wetland functions. For example, restricting tidal influx to coastal marshes may limit their natural tendency to accumulate sediment and organic matter to keep up with sea level rise (Redfield & Rubin 1962; Nyman et al. 2006). If barriers are left in place for many years, it may not be possible to ever remove them without flooding the marshes or swamps they were intended to protect.
Related actions: Build barriers to protect littoral areas from boat wakes; Divert/replace/block saltwater inputs; Use artificial barriers to block pollution; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of building barriers to protect littoral brackish/salt marshes from rising water levels and severe weather. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Italy and one was in the Netherlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that protecting salt marshes with offshore structures had no significant effect on the seaward limit of emergent vegetation, after 17–27 months. It was similar, or retreated at a similar rate, in protected and unprotected marshes. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that brackish marshes protected with oyster shell reefs receded less, over one year, than unprotected marshes.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that marshes protected with low sea walls had a similar overall plant community composition to nearby natural salt marshes, 15–22 years after the walls were built.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One controlled study in Italy reported that a salt marsh protected with an offshore fence contained more plant species, after 17 months, than an unfenced marsh. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands recorded 85 plant and algal species across two salt marshes that had developed behind low sea walls, over 15–22 years, compared to 155 species recorded across multiple natural marshes in the region.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two controlled studies (one also replicated, randomized, paired) in Italy and the USA found that brackish/salt marshes protected with offshore structures contained a similar total amount of vegetation to unprotected marshes. This was true for cover and biomass.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes protected with offshore breakwaters (and planted with cordgrasses Spartina spp.) typically contained less smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes. One replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands reported that in marshes protected with low sea walls for 15–22 years and nearby natural salt marshes, the same plant species were the most frequent.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes protected with offshore breakwaters (and planted with cordgrasses Spartina spp.) contained shorter smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora plants, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes.

3185: Designate zones for migration of marshes or swamps as climate changes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Areas could be left undeveloped as spaces for migration of marshes and swamps as climate changes and sea levels rise. This philosophy should be integrated into urban planning, especially along coastlines (Green et al. 2009). For example, in Yankeetown on the coast of Florida, USA, development is prohibited within 50 feet of a wetland to allow space for migration with sea level rise (Anon 2016). Areas for migration should be of reasonable size and ideally connected to existing marshes or swamps. Barriers to habitat migration, such as roads and embankments, may need to be actively removed. Long-term land ownership issues should be considered; it may be necessary to purchase areas designated for habitat migration (DELWP 2016).
We realize that providing evidence for the effects of this intervention will be difficult, but include the action for completeness: it is something that could be done to conserve marsh or swamp vegetation.

3190: Restore/create freshwater marshes or swamps (specific action unclear)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section includes studies that aimed to “restore” or “create” marshes or swamps, but did not clearly describe the specific action(s) that were done. Commonly, this occurs when the primary focus of a study is an animal taxon, so details of vegetation restoration were not deemed relevant by the authors. Alternatively, if the study involves actions carried out historically, details of the action may be unavailable.
Several studies in this section refer to conservatism scores and a floristic quality index. Conservatism scores reflect the fidelity of individual plant species to undegraded natural habitats in the study region. The floristic quality index is the product of the average conservatism score for all plant species in a community and the square root of the number of species.
This section does not include studies that simply report the area or number of sites “restored” or “created”, without quantifying the vegetation in those sites.

Key Messages:

Twenty-five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restoring/creating freshwater marshes or swamps using unclear or incompletely described actions. Twenty-three studies were in the USA. Two were in Canada. Two of the studies used the same set of wetlands.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community types (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created wetlands had greater coverage of herbaceous vegetation after 7–8 years than natural wetlands, but lower coverage of forest and shrubby vegetation.
Community composition (17 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that the overall plant community composition in created freshwater wetlands differed from the community in natural wetlands, after 1–21 years. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada reported mixed effects of freshwater marsh restoration/creation on overall algal or plant community composition, depending on the habitat and use of mining waste during creation. Of four replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Canada, three reported lower quality vegetation in restored/created wetlands than in natural wetlands, but one reported similar vegetation quality in created and natural wetlands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that created marshes developed a plant community characteristic of similar wetness to natural marshes within 4–21 years – but in one study, this was only true for created marshes &gt;10 years old. Seven replicated studies in the USA simply quantified the composition, quality or wetness of the plant community up to 22 years after wetland restoration/creation.
Overall richness/diversity (17 studies): Eleven replicated studies, in the USA and Canada, compared overall plant richness/diversity in created/restored and natural/unmanaged freshwater wetlands. Five of the studies found that created/restored wetlands typically had similar plant taxonomic richness to natural/unmanaged wetlands. Three of the studies reported lower species richness in created than natural wetlands after 1–18 years. Two of the studies reported higher species richness in created than natural wetlands after 1–21 years. The final study reported mixed effects of marsh creation on plant species richness, depending on the vegetation zone and use of mining waste during creation. Two of the studies reported identical results for plant diversity as for richness (similar or greater in created vs natural wetlands) but one study found that the effect of management on plant diversity depended on the timing of drawdown. Six replicated studies in the USA simply quantified overall plant species richness and/or diversity over 1–16 years after wetland restoration/creation.
Native richness/diversity (3 studies): Of two replicated, site comparison studies of freshwater wetlands in the USA, one found that restored/created wetlands contained more native plant species than natural wetlands after 1–11 years. The other found that restored wetlands contained fewer native plant species than natural wetlands after 2–8 years. One replicated study of swamp restoration sites in the USA simply quantified native plant richness over 1–8 years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (7 studies): Six replicated studies, all in the USA, compared overall vegetation abundance in created/restored and natural wetlands. Four of the studies found that created/restored freshwater wetlands contained less vegetation (cover or biomass) than natural wetlands after 1–18 years. Two of the studies found that created and natural fresh/brackish/saline wetlands contained a similar amount of vegetation (overall cover and density; wetland plant cover) after &gt;1 year. One of these studies reported that restored wetlands had lower vegetation cover than natural marshes – but this reflected management goals. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified total vegetation cover and biomass 3–10 years after marsh creation.
Herb abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created wetlands had greater overall cover of herb species, after 7–8 years, than natural wetlands. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified herb biomass in wetland restoration sites after 7–22 years.
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated study in the USA simply quantified the density of woody vegetation in wetland restoration sites after 7–22 years.
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that ≤15-year-old restored freshwater marshes contained a similar phytoplankton biomass to natural marshes.
Individual species abundance (9 studies): Nine studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that created and natural freshwater marshes supported a similar abundance of pickerelweed Pontederia cordata after 1–11 years.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restoring/creating brackish/saline marshes or swamps using unclear or incompletely described actions. Four studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Australia, Canada and Indonesia.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (4 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in the USA and Australia reported that the overall plant or algal community composition in restored/created marshes typically became more like natural reference marshes over time. One replicated, site comparison study of fresh/brackish wetlands in Canada reported that the overall plant community was lower quality in restored/created sites than natural sites, after ≥3 years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that created marshes had similar overall plant diversity, after 1–14 years, to natural marshes. Created marshes had lower plant species richness than natural marshes on average, but richness became more similar to natural marshes with time since creation.
Algae/phytoplankton richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of brackish/saline marshes in the USA reported that restored and natural marshes contained a similar number of algal species, and found that they had similar algal diversity, after 1–28 years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that created marshes contained less overall plant biomass, after 1–14 years, than natural marshes – but that biomass increased with time since creation. One replicated, site comparison study of fresh/brackish/saline marshes in the USA found that created (but not restored) marshes had similar overall vegetation cover to natural marshes. Both created and restored marshes had similar cover of wetland vegetation to natural marshes.
Herb abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of brackish/saline marshes in the USA reported that restored marshes contained a greater density of cordgrasses Spartina than natural marshes in six of eight comparisons. Vegetation was surveyed 1–28 years after restoration, which involved planting cordgrasses. One replicated, paired site comparison study in the USA reported that created intertidal wetlands contained more smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than nearby natural mangrove forests for around 13 years.
Tree/shrub abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired site comparison study in the USA reported that created intertidal wetlands contained fewer adult mangrove trees than nearby natural mangrove forests for up to 20 years – but predicted equivalence within 55 years. One replicated study in Indonesia simply quantified the density of tree seedlings three years after restoration of former mangrove ponds.
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One paired, site comparison study of brackish/saline marshes in the USA reported that older restored marshes (≥26 years old) contained a similar or greater abundance of algae to natural marshes, whereas younger restored marshes (&lt;13 years old) contained less algae than natural marshes.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One replicated, paired site comparison study in the USA reported that created intertidal wetlands contained thinner adult mangrove trees than nearby natural mangrove forests for up to 20 years – but predicted equivalence within 25 years.

3192: Restore/create freshwater marshes or swamps (multiple actions)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section includes studies of marsh or swamp restoration/creation that test more than three separate actions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single specific action. Where three or fewer actions have been used together in a study, results are reported elsewhere on this site: under each action (but noting the influence of the others, where appropriate) or sometimes as a combined action (e.g. Deposit soil/sediment and introduce vegetation). When multiple actions have been used but not clearly described, studies are summarized under Restore/create marshes or swamps (specific action unclear).
This section does not include studies that simply report the area or number of sites “restored” or “created”, without quantifying the vegetation in those sites.

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using &gt;3 combined actions to restore/create freshwater marshes or swamps. Fourteen studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Canada, the UK and East Africa. There was overlap in the sites used in three studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in Canada reported that the area of emergent vegetation in a marsh was greater after 5–6 years of intervention than in the year before.
Community composition (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that restored/created freshwater wetlands contained different overall plant communities to natural or reference wetlands, after 1–8 years. Two site comparison studies in the USA reported similarity in species composition between restored/created and natural wetlands. Similarity ranged from 35% to 79% after 1–5 years. One study in the USA simply quantified the plant community composition of different pools within a marsh, two years after its creation.
Overall richness/diversity (16 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA and Canada reported that multiple restoration actions increased overall or emergent plant species richness over 1–6 years. Another replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA reported that the effect of restoration on plant species richness varied between years. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that restored/created wetlands had similar plant species richness to natural or reference wetlands, after 1–8 years. One site comparison study in the USA reported that a created wetland contained fewer plant species than nearby natural marshes, after two years. Nine studies (four replicated, one before-and-after) in the USA and the UK simply quantified overall plant species richness and/or diversity approximately 1–10 years after intervention.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (6 studies): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions increased the richness of wetland-characteristic plant species over three subsequent years. Five studies (two replicated) in the USA simply quantified wetland-characteristic plant richness up to 10 years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (one also a site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions reduced overall vegetation cover over the five subsequent years. Two replicated studies in the USA simply quantified overall vegetation cover for up to six years after intervention.
Characteristic plant abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (one also a site comparison) of freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that multiple restoration actions did not increase the cover of wetland-characteristic vegetation over three subsequent years. One of the studies also monitored in the fifth (wetter) year after restoration, and reported greater cover of wetland-characteristic vegetation than before restoration. One replicated study on the same set of wetlands in the USA simply quantified wetland-characteristic vegetation cover for up to three years after intervention.
Herb abundance (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that restored wet prairies had similar grass and forb cover to remnant prairies after 3–8 years. Another replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created dune slacks had greater cover of annual herbs after three years than mature natural slacks, but similar cover of perennial herbs and floating aquatic herbs. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported greater herb cover 1–5 years after restoration of freshwater wetlands than before.
Tree/shrub abundance (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that created dune slacks had similar cover of trees and shrubs, after three years, to mature natural slacks. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported lower cover of woody vegetation 1–5 years after restoration of freshwater wetlands than before. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified woody plant cover 1–2 years after intervention.
Individual species abundance (10 studies): Ten studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, the replicated, site comparison study in East Africa reported that the biomass of papyrus Cyperus papyrus in created marshes was within the range of natural marshes in the region after 18 months.

3193: Restore/create brackish/saline marshes or swamps (multiple actions)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section includes studies of marsh or swamp restoration/creation that test more than three separate actions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single specific action. Where three or fewer actions have been used together in a study, results are reported elsewhere on this site: under each action (but noting the influence of the others, where appropriate) or sometimes as a combined action (e.g. Deposit soil/sediment and introduce vegetation). When multiple actions have been used but not clearly described, studies are summarized under Restore/create marshes or swamps (specific action unclear).
This section does not include studies that simply report the area or number of sites “restored” or “created”, without quantifying the vegetation in those sites.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using &gt;3 combined actions to restore/create brackish/saline marshes or swamps. Six studies were in the USA. One was in Singapore. One was in Indonesia. Three studies were based on the same experimental set-up.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One study of a coastal site in the USA reported that the coverage of mangrove vegetation increased, and the coverage of herbaceous vegetation declined, over five years after intervention (intended to restore mangrove forest).
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): Three studies of one salt marsh restoration site in the USA simply quantified plant species richness for up to 13 growing seasons after intervention.
Tree/shrub richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Indonesia reported that a restored aquaculture pond contained a similar number of mangrove species to nearby reference forests, just 6–7 months after intervention. Some trees may have been present before intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that restored marshes had similar overall vegetation cover to natural marshes after 9–20 years. Three studies of one salt marsh restoration site in the USA simply quantified overall vegetation abundance for up to 13 growing seasons after intervention.
Tree/shrub abundance (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that restored marshes had similar, limited shrub cover to natural marshes after 9–20 years. One site comparison study of mangrove forests in Singapore reported that a created mangrove forest supported lower above-ground biomass than mature natural forests after ≥15 years. One study in Indonesia simply counted the number of mangrove trees present 6–7 months after intervention.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies in estuaries in the USA simply quantified the abundance of individual plant species for up to 13 growing seasons after intervention.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA found that restored marshes had less cover of short vegetation and greater cover of medium-height vegetation than natural marshes after 9–20 years. Restored and natural marshes had similar cover of tall vegetation.
Height (2 studies): One study of a created mangrove forest in Singapore reported that the average height of surviving mangrove saplings increased over five years. One study of a salt marsh restoration site in the USA reported that maximum vegetation height did not clearly increase between the third and twelfth/thirteenth growing seasons after intervention.

Related actions: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure, without introducing vegetation.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the combined effects, on vegetation, of depositing soil/sediment to form the physical structure of brackish/salt marshes and introducing vegetation. All six studies were in the USA. Several sites, and even the same data from some sites, were used in multiple studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies of salt marshes in the USA compared the overall area of emergent vegetation in marshes created by depositing sediment and planting vs natural marshes. One study found that created and natural marshes had similar vegetation coverage after 2–23 years. The other study reported that created marshes had slightly lower vegetation coverage than nearby natural marshes after 2–4 years.
Community types (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that four of four plant community types had similar coverage in created and natural salt marshes after 3–15 years. For most marshes, creation involved depositing sediment and planting herbs.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA reported that the overall plant community in salt marshes created by depositing sediment and planting herbs/shrubs was &lt;36% similar to nearby natural salt marshes, after 2–4 years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One paired, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes created by depositing sediment and planting/sowing herbs typically contained at least as much vegetation (biomass and density) as natural marshes, after 1–4 years.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, two studies (one review, one site comparison) in the USA found that salt marshes created by depositing sediment and introducing vegetation typically contained a similar amount (density and/or biomass) of cordgrasses Spartina spp. to nearby natural marshes, after 1–9 years. Meanwhile, one paired, site comparison study in the USA reported that whether created marshes contained a higher, lower or similar cordgrass density to natural marshes depended on plot elevation.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes created (mostly) by depositing sediment and planting herbs contained larger patches of vegetation with straighter edges than natural marshes, after 3–15 years. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA reported that created salt marshes contained a similar proportion of edge habitat to nearby natural salt marshes, after 2–23 years.
Height (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the USA compared the height of cordgrasses Spartina sp. in created and nearby natural marshes. One study (also paired) found that created marshes typically contained cordgrass of similar height to natural marshes, after 1–4 growing seasons. The other study reported that cordgrass was shorter in created than natural marshes, after 7–9 years.

3198: Raise water level to restore/create freshwater marshes from other land uses
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves one-off action to raise the water level/table to restore/create marshes from other land uses. This means that intervention should (a) occur at one point in time, after which the water table is not actively managed, and (b) must affect an area that does not retain substantial characteristics of the target habitat. This could be an upland area (e.g. grassland), an unvegetated wetland (e.g. mudflats), or a wetland other than the target type (e.g. swamp, where the habitat used to be a marsh).
Specific techniques to raise water levels include: blocking drainage ditches (using sediment, rocks, plastic dams, wooden dams or vegetation); building raised embankments, berms or levees to retain water; switching off drainage pumps; ceasing groundwater extraction; installing or widening culverts (e.g. under roads and railways, to increase water flow into focal marsh/swamp); removing dams upstream of the focal marsh/swamp; and reprofiling or diverting river channels to raise the water level on floodplains. All of these techniques aim to make soils saturated or flooded, or make them saturated or flooded for longer, so they can support emergent wetland vegetation. The resulting water level may be stable or fluctuating, and may create permanently or seasonally flooded wetlands. Sediment inputs may also increase in line with water inputs.
Caution: This action may have negative effects on habitats elsewhere in the catchment. For example, removing dams upstream of a focal site could drain wetlands or aquatic habitats upstream of the dam. There may also be conflicts with water needs of human populations that need to be managed. Rewetting drained acid sulphate soils – common in coastal areas and salinized inland areas – can lead to acidification, deoxygenation and release of toxic metals (Baldwin 2011).
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes; Flood cropland when fallow; Actively manage water level; Reprofile/relandscape or Remove surface soil/sediment, both of which can lower the ground surface towards the water table; Raise water level to complement planting; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including water level manipulations.

Key Messages:

Twenty-six studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level to restore/create freshwater marshes from other land uses or habitat types. Twenty-one studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Israel, the UK, China, Luxembourg and Canada. Eight studies used sites from a common set of 62 restored prairie potholes in the Midwest USA. Five studies monitored the effects of one river dechannelization project in Florida.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (5 studies): One replicated, paired, before-and-after, site comparison study in the USA reported that damming a stream reduced the area of emergent vegetation on the floodplain. Two before-and-after studies of a floodplain in the USA reported that after dechannelizing a river to raise the water level, the area of emergent herbaceous vegetation increased. Two studies in the USA and Luxembourg simply quantified coverage of wetland vegetation 1–6 years after raising the water table (sometimes along with other interventions).
Community types (9 studies): Nine studies quantified the effect of this action on specific types of marsh vegetation. For example, one before-and-after study of a floodplain in the USA reported greatly increased coverage of wet prairie plant communities after dechannelizing a river to raise the water table, but only slightly increased coverage of mixed herbaceous/shrubby wetland communities. Five studies in the USA and Luxembourg simply quantified the number, abundance or extent of wetland plant communities present 1–6 years after raising the water table (typically along with other interventions).
Community composition (8 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies (two also paired) in the USA evaluated the effects of rewetting farmed depressions (along with planting cover crops in/around them). One of these studies reported that restored wetlands contained a different overall plant community to natural wetlands after 5–7 years. One study reported that the plant community composition differed more between restored and natural wetlands than amongst restored or natural wetlands. The final study found that restoration increased vegetation quality after ≥10 years, but not to the level of natural wetlands. Two site comparison studies in China and the USA reported that the plant community became more similar to natural wetlands over 6–15 years after raising the water level – in terms of species composition or overall wetness. Three replicated studies in the USA simply quantified the plant community composition for up to three years after rewetting farmland (sometimes along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (12 studies): Four replicated, site comparison studies (two also paired) of one set of historically farmed depressions in the USA reported that restored wetlands (rewetted, along with planting cover crops in/around the sites) had lower overall plant species richness than nearby natural wetlands, after 1–7 years. Two before-and-after, site comparison studies of historical wetlands on a floodplain in the USA reported that raising the water level reduced overall plant species richness in the following six years. One site comparison study of lakeshore marshes in China reported that the total plant species richness in former paddy fields with breached weirs was similar to a nearby natural marsh, after 2–15 years. Five studies (two replicated) in the USA and Israel simply quantified overall plant species richness and/or diversity between three months and 19 years after raising the water table (sometimes along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One before-and-after, site-comparison study of a floodplain in the USA reported that dechannelizing a river to raise the water level had no clear effect on the richness of wetland-characteristic plant species in the following six years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE                                                                            

Overall abundance (9 studies): Three before-and-after, site-comparison studies of historical wetlands on a floodplain in the USA reported that dechannelizing a river to raise the water level reduced overall vegetation cover in the following 6–9 years. One site comparison study in China reported that vegetation biomass in former paddy fields with breached weirs was similar to a nearby natural marsh, after 2–15 years. In contrast, one replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that vegetation cover in rewetted, formerly farmed depressions (also planted with cover crops) was lower than in nearby natural wetlands, after 5–7 years. Four studies (two replicated) in the USA and the UK simply quantified vegetation abundance between three months and six years after raising the water table (sometimes along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant abundance (4 studies): Three before-and-after studies (two also site comparisons) of historical wetlands on a floodplain in the USA reported that dechannelizing a river to raise the water level increased the abundance of habitat- and/or wetland-characteristic plant species in the following 6–9 years. One study in the UK simply quantified the abundance of wet meadow plant species present 3–5 years after rewetting farmland (and introducing grazing).
Bryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that the frequency of bryophytes in (the wettest parts of) marshes rewetted 34 years previously was not significantly different from their frequency in (the wettest parts of) nearby natural marshes.
Individual species abundance (11 studies): Eleven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, site comparison study of freshwater marshes in the USA reported that Kneiff’s feathermoss Leptodictyum riparium was the most abundant plant species in marshes rewetted 34 years previously and nearby natural marshes. One before-and-after study of historical wetlands on a floodplain in the USA reported that after dechannelizing a river to raise the water level, some plots became dominated by a non-native grass species.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level to restore/create freshwater swamps from other land uses or habitat types. Both studies monitored the effects of one river dechannelization project in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study of a floodplain in the USA reported that after dechannelizing a river to raise the water level, the area of shrubby and forested wetlands increased – reaching greater coverage than before intervention, but also than before degradation.
Community types (1 study): The same study broke down overall swamp coverage into specific community types. For example, most of the shrubby wetlands that developed after raising the water level were dominated by a non-native species – which was not present historically.

Overall abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study of historical shrubby wetlands on a floodplain in the USA reported that dechannelizing a river to raise the water level reduced overall vegetation cover in the following nine years.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): The same study reported that after dechannelizing a river to raise the water level, only one of two sites became dominated by wetland-characteristic shrubs. The other site remained dominated by wetland-characteristic herb species.
Individual species abundance (1 study): The same study reported that dechannelizing a river to raise the water level slightly increased cover of buttonbush Cephalanthus occidentalis in one of two sites (no data for other site).

3205: Lower water level to restore/create brackish/saline swamps from other land uses
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves one-off action to lower the water level and restore or create swamps from other land uses, i.e. in areas that do not retain substantial characteristics of the target habitat. By definition, these other land uses will always be aquatic habitats such as reservoirs or lakes. The lowered water level should not depend on continued intervention (e.g. pumping). Specific techniques to reduce water levels include removing dams downstream, or switching off pumps that add water to a focal site. This action includes water level reductions to any depth that could, in theory, support emergent wetland vegetation.
Caution: This action may have negative effects on habitats elsewhere in the catchment. For example, removing dams could flood marshes, swamps or upland habitats downstream. There may also be conflicts with water needs of human populations that need to be managed.

3206: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore/create freshwater marshes from other land uses
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action includes actions that facilitate tidal exchange, in order to restore or create marshes from other land uses. The action may be a single permanent one (e.g. breaching sea walls or embankments, installing or widening culverts, excavating tidal creeks) or a reversible one (e.g. opening sluice gates once per day). However, the intervention must affect an area that does not retain substantial characteristics of the target habitat. This could be an upland area (e.g. the thousands of square kilometres of farmland that has been reclaimed from salt marsh in the Netherlands since the Middle Ages; Wolff 1992), an unvegetated wetland (e.g. mudflats), or a wetland other than the target type (e.g. swamp, where the habitat used to be a marsh). “Planned retreat” and “managed realignment” fall within the scope of this action.
Tidal wetlands may be brackish/saline (e.g. mangroves, coastal marshes) or freshwater (e.g. at the upstream end of estuaries, as in the Mississippi, Yangtze, and Elbe rivers; Baldwin et al. 2009). Studies of accidental realignment, such as when coastal defences are breached by a storm, have not been summarized as evidence (e.g. Onaindia et al. 2001; some sites in Williams & Orr 2002).
Related actions: Facilitate tidal exchange to restore degraded marshes; Reprofile/relandscape or Remove surface soil/sediment, both of which can alter patterns of tidal exchange; Facilitate tidal exchange to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Fourteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of facilitating tidal exchange to restore/create brackish/salt marshes from other land uses or habitat types. Seven studies were in the UK. Five studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Australia and the Netherlands. There was overlap in the sites used in four of the studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies in Australia, the UK and the Netherlands reported increases in the overall extent of salt marsh vegetation over 3–10 years after restoring tidal exchange.
Community types (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the UK reported that restored marshes, developing after 2–13 years of tidal exchange, contained a different type of salt marsh plant community to natural marshes in four of four cases. Two before-and-after studies in the UK and the Netherlands reported increases in the frequency or coverage of salt marsh plant communities after restoring tidal exchange, reaching 93–100% after 9–10 years.
Community composition (4 studies): Four site comparison studies (two replicated, one paired) in the UK and the USA reported that after facilitating tidal exchange on freshwater wetlands or farmland, the overall plant community composition remained somewhat different from natural brackish/salt marshes for up to 30 years. Three of the studies reported increasing community similarity to natural marshes over 11–30 years of tidal exchange.
Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Two site comparison studies of brackish/salt marshes in the USA and the UK reported that overall plant species richness was similar in marshes developing after 4–11 years of tidal exchange, and in nearby natural marshes. Two site comparison studies (one replicated) of salt marshes in the UK reported that marshes developing after 1–14 years of tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions) had lower plant species richness or diversity than nearby natural marshes. Two before-and-after studies in the UK compared the number of plant/algae species present in salt marshes that developed over 1–9 years after restoring tidal exchange to the number of plant species present before intervention. In one study there were more species after intervention, but in the other study there were fewer.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of salt marshes in the UK reported that marshes developing after 1–14 years of tidal exchange contained a similar number of salt-tolerant plant species to natural marshes. One before-and-after study in the Netherlands reported that all 23 target brackish/salt marsh species were present in the study site 10 years after restoring regular tidal exchange: more than were present before restoration.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (6 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) of salt marshes in the UK reported that marshes developing after 1–14 years of tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions) had lower overall vegetation cover than nearby natural marshes. One before-and-after study in the UK reported that 99% of salt marsh quadrats were vegetated nine years after restoring tidal exchange, compared to 100% in the freshwater wetland that previously occupied the site and 43% one summer after restoration. Three studies in the USA and the UK simply quantified the overall cover of vegetation present in sites for up to 15 years after facilitating tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that some plant species diagnostic of natural brackish marshes were absent from a marsh that had developed over &gt;30 years of restored tidal exchange.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, three site comparison studies of salt marshes in the UK reported that cover of saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima was similar or lower in marshes developing after 1–14 years of tidal exchange (sometimes along with other interventions) than in nearby natural marshes. In contrast, in these studies, cover of glassworts Salicornia was higher in restored than natural marshes.

3210: Fill/block ditches
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ditches could form as a result of erosion (e.g. heavy rainfall, repeated livestock use of set trails) or be deliberately dug to drain wetlands for agriculture, forestry or mining. It may be desirable to fill or block a ditch to allow vegetation characteristic of shallow still water to grow – as opposed to vegetation characteristic of deeper and perhaps moving water in extant ditches. Evidence summarized for this action relates to effects on vegetation within filled/blocked ditches.
Related actions: Backfill canals or trenches dug as transport or service corridors;     Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects of filling/blocking ditches in marshes or swamps on vegetation within the ditches.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches.

3211: Excavate freshwater pools
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Pools are small, discrete water bodies: &lt;8 ha in area or &lt;280 m in diameter (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2016). They may be permanently or seasonally flooded. Pools may be lost through drainage or filling, or become degraded through pollution, invasion or lack of management. For this intervention, we consider “pools” and “ponds” as synonymous.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must evaluate the effects of excavating pools on emergent vegetation (e.g. coverage of emergent vegetation within permanent pools, or characteristics of vegetation in marshes or swamps around pools). Studies of pools, or zones within pools, that contain little emergent vegetation will be summarized in a future synopsis.
Related actions: Reprofile/relandscape areas larger than pools (freshwater marshes – freshwater swamps).

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation within pools or surrounding marshes/swamps, of excavating freshwater pools. Five studies were in the USA, one was in Guam and one was in Canada. Two of the studies in the USA were based on the same set of pools.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (2 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a freshwater marsh in Canada reported that a smaller proportion of individual plants around excavated pools were wetland-characteristic species, compared to the proportion around natural pools. The excavated pools were 1–3 years old. One replicated study in the USA reported that excavated pools became dominated by non-native plant species over eight years.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in a freshwater marsh in Canada found that overall plant species richness and diversity were similar around excavated pools and natural pools, 1–3 years after excavation. Two studies involving freshwater marshes in Guam and the USA simply quantified plant species richness 12–18 months after excavation (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that excavated and natural pools had similar cover of emergent vegetation, seven years after excavation. The same was true for submerged vegetation.
Characteristic plant abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies in the USA reported the abundance of native pool-characteristic species over 3–8 years after excavating pools. One of the studies was also a site comparison and reported that these species were less abundant in the excavated pools than nearby natural pools.
Shrub abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that excavated and natural pools had similar cover of shrubby vegetation after seven years. One replicated study in the USA simply quantified shrub abundance over five years after excavating pools/potholes (along with other interventions).
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that excavated and natural pools contained a similar biomass of surface-coating algae and phytoplankton, after seven years. The same was true for phytoplankton after eight years.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that excavated and natural pools had similar cover of loosestrife Lythrum sp. seven years after excavation, but that excavated pools had greater cover of duckweed Lemna sp., cattails Typha spp. and common reed Phragmites australis.

3213: Reprofile/relandscape: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves large-scale reprofiling or landscaping, aiming to restore or create marshes. This includes excavating large basins (&gt;8 ha or &gt;280 m diameter), moving soil/sediment from the site into levees/berms/impoundments, removing unnatural hills or levees, filling in deep depressions and altering the elevation/slope of coastal areas. In other words, this intervention aims to restore wetland hydrology (how wet the soil is and when it is wet/flooded) by adjusting the ground surface relative to the water table or sea. Soil from existing marshes or swamps might be imported as part of relandscaping efforts, but we consider this as a separate action.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping to restore or create freshwater marshes. Ten studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of France, the UK and Italy. Two pairs of studies used the same or similar sites in Connecticut and Nebraska.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that emergent vegetation stands covered a smaller area within excavated than natural marshes, 4–5 years after intervention.
Community composition (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after, one replicated) in France and the USA reported that reprofiling affected the overall plant community composition. In the USA, the community differed from, but was not intermediate between, natural marshes and degraded marshes. One study in the USA simply quantified the wetness of the overall plant community in an excavated wetland, 1–2 growing seasons after intervention.
Overall richness/diversity (9 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies in the USA found that plant species richness (overall or wetland species) was similar in reprofiled and natural marshes, 1–13 years after intervention. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the UK reported that overall plant species richness was not higher in excavated (and planted) reedbeds, than in a nearby natural reedbed, after seven years. One before-and-after study in France reported that there were more plant species present in a marsh in the two summers after reprofiling than in the summer before. Four studies in the USA and Italy simply reported the number of plant species on wetlands that had been reprofiled or excavated (sometimes along with other interventions), after three months to 23 years.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study in the USA simply reported the number of wetland-characteristic plant species in excavated wetlands, for up to 18 years after intervention.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (8 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA reported that overall vegetation cover was similar in reprofiled and natural marshes, 2–13 years after intervention. One of the studies also found that vegetation cover was similar in reprofiled and degraded marshes. Another replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that vegetation cover within emergent vegetation stands was lower in excavated than natural marshes, 4–5 years after intervention. Five studies in the USA simply quantified overall vegetation abundance on wetlands that had been reprofiled or excavated (sometimes along with other interventions), after three months to 18 years. One of these studies reported an absence of vegetation after two years.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One study in the USA simply quantified the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants in an excavated wetland, after 1–2 growing seasons.
Bryophyte abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that excavated marshes contained a lower abundance (frequency and biomass) of bryophytes than natural marshes, 2–15 years after intervention.
Trees/shrub abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that excavated marshes had lower woody plant cover than natural marshes, after 12–13 years.
Individual species abundance (10 studies): Ten studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Two of these studies were replicated site comparisons in the USA, and reported mixed responses. For example, broadleaf cattail Typha latifolia typically had lower cover in excavated than natural marshes in one study, but greater cover in excavated than natural marshes in the other study.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping to restore or create brackish/salt marshes. Seven studies were in the USA. One was in Belgium. One was in Italy. Two of the studies were based on the same marsh.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (2 studies): One paired, site comparison study in an estuary in the USA reported that vegetation coverage on reprofiled sediment, after 2–3 years, did not clearly differ from natural marsh areas in two of three comparisons. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA reported that reprofiled coastal areas, where submerged sediment had been pushed into ridges, contained a smaller proportion of salt marsh habitat than nearby natural areas.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): Two studies in Belgium and Italy simply quantified plant species richness in marshy areas that had been reprofiled or excavated (sometimes along with other interventions), for up to 23 years after intervention began.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One study in an estuary in the USA simply reported the number of salt marsh plant species that colonized an area of reprofiled sediment over seven years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): One site comparison study of salt marshes in the USA reported that a marsh created by reprofiling sediment (along with other interventions, including planting) had lower overall vegetation cover than a nearby natural marsh, after three growing seasons. One study in an estuary in Belgium simply quantified the cover of vegetation that colonized an area of reprofiled sediment over five years.
Individual species abundance (6 studies): Six studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Of four site comparison studies in the USA, three reported that the dominant herb species was typically less abundant – in terms of cover or biomass – in marshes that had been reprofiled (sometimes along with other interventions) than in natural areas, after 2–5 years. The other study reported that density of the dominant herb species in a reprofiled (and planted) marsh was within the range of nearby natural marshes, after five years. Two studies in the USA and Belgium simply quantified cover of individual plant species over five years after reprofiling (sometimes along with other interventions).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA found that the layout of salt marsh habitat (e.g. patch size and complexity) differed between reprofiled coastal areas, where submerged sediment had been pushed into ridges, and nearby natural areas.
Height (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that California cordgrass Spartina foliosa was shorter in a 5-year-old reprofiled marsh (also planted with cordgrass) than in nearby natural marshes.

This includes excavating large basins (&gt;8 ha or &gt;280 m diameter), moving soil/sediment from the site into levees/berms/impoundments, removing unnatural hills or levees, filling in deep depressions and altering the elevation/slope of coastal areas. In other words, this action aims to restore wetland hydrology (how wet the soil is and when it is wet/flooded) by adjusting the ground surface relative to the water table or sea. Soil from existing marshes or swamps might be imported as part of relandscaping efforts, but we consider this as a separate action.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this intervention. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling or relandscaping to restore or create freshwater swamps. Both studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by reprofiling uplands (along with planting trees/shrubs) contained a similar proportion of tree species in different plant groups, after 7–11 years, to nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by reprofiling uplands (along with planting trees/shrubs) had similar ground and canopy cover, after 7–11 years, to nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study in a former firing range in the USA simply quantified herb cover approximately 1–2 years after reprofiling the site (and planting trees/shrubs).
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One study in a former firing range in the USA simply quantified woody plant cover approximately 1–2 years after reprofiling the site (and planting trees/shrubs).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by reprofiling uplands (along with planting trees/shrubs) had less horizontal vegetation cover, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.
Height (1 study): The same study found that swamps created by reprofiling uplands (along with planting trees/shrubs) contained shorter woody vegetation, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging. Herbaceous vegetation, however, was of similar height in both created and naturally recovering swamps.
Basal area (1 study): The same study found that swamps created by reprofiling uplands (along with planting trees/shrubs) had a lower vegetation basal area, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of reprofiling/relandscaping to restore or create brackish/saline swamps. Three studies were in the USA. Two of these shared a study site. There was one study in Singapore and one in Thailand.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One study of a coastal site in the USA reported that the area of mangrove vegetation increased between 6 and 14 years after reprofiling (and planting propagules).
Relative abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the USA and Singapore reported that areas of reprofiled coastal land (sometimes also planted with propagules) supported a different relative abundance of tree species to natural forests, after roughly 3–15 years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Singapore reported that an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation had higher plant species richness, after three and a half years, than an adjacent mature mangrove patch.
Tree/shrub richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they contained a similar number of tree species to nearby mature forests after 7–30 years. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand simply reported the number of mangrove tree species that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Singapore reported that an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation had a higher density of individual plants, after three and a half years, than an adjacent mature mangrove patch.
Tree/shrub abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they contained a greater density of trees than nearby mature forests after 17–30 years. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand simply reported the number of mangrove trees that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).
Individual species abundance (1 study): One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand reported the number of mangrove trees, by species, that spontaneously colonized in the six years after reprofiling (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they had a different overall structure to nearby mature forests after 17–30 years.
Height (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA, reported that where mangrove forests developed on reprofiled (and planted) sites, they had a shorter canopy than nearby mature forests after 17–30 years. One site comparison study in Singapore reported that in an area of reprofiled coastal land colonized by mangrove vegetation, most plants were in a similar height category to those in an adjacent mature mangrove patch, but that the maximum plant height was lower. Vegetation was surveyed three and a half years after reprofiling.
Diameter/perimeter/area (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the USA reported that mangrove forests that developed on reprofiled (and planted) coastal areas contained thinner trees, on average, than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years.
Basal area (3 studies): Three site comparison studies in the USA compared mangrove forests that developed on reprofiled (and planted) coastal areas to mature natural forests. Two of the studies reported that restored forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years. The other study reported that restored forests had a similar basal area to mature natural forests, after 17–30 years.

3217: Create mounds or hollows: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves creating discrete mounds (e.g. by adding blocks of soil, bundles of sticks, other coarse woody debris) or hollows (e.g. by excavation) to provide suitable conditions for emergent wetland vegetation. The scale of this action falls somewhere between reprofiling/relandscaping (large-scale landscape features, tens of metres wide) and disturbing the soil/sediment surface (which may create small scale mounds or hollows, millimetres or a few centimetres wide/deep).
Often, this action aims to mimic the natural microtopography of marshes, which can be created by sediment accumulation, erosion, tree fall, root growth or animal activity (Vivian-Smith 1997, Bruland & Richardson 2005). Microtopography can increase plant diversity, because the different microclimates or microelevations may support different species (Vivian-Smith 1997). Depressions might provide sheltered and moist microclimates, in which the first colonizing plants can become established. Large woody debris will also release nutrients as it decomposes.
Studies that simply compare vegetation on mounds vs hollows (e.g. Bruland & Richardson 2005) have not been summarized as evidence here, even if those mounds and hollows were deliberately created.
Related actions: Reprofile/relandscape larger areas; Disturb soil/sediment surface without creating discrete mounds and/or hollows; Create mounds or hollows before planting.

3221: Remove surface soil/sediment: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Surface soil/sediment – and any vegetation on it – could be removed to create a new bare surface for plants to colonize. This new surface may have fewer nutrients and pollutants, have no undesirable seed bank, and have a looser surface. Soil/sediment removal can also make a site wetter, by bringing the surface closer to the water table, increasing the frequency/duration of tidal flooding, or increasing the water depth in an already flooded site. This action may be particularly useful in naturally dynamic habitats that have been artificially stabilized, mimicking disturbances that would create bare soil/sediment.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002). Stripping topsoil can have counter-intuitive effects, such as increasing ammonium concentrations because nitrifying bacteria, which break down ammonia, are removed with the soil (Dorland 2004). It may remove seeds of desirable species, and can be expensive.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes; Raise water level to restore/create marshes from other land uses; Reprofile/relandscape; Bury surface soil/sediment; Disturb soil/sediment surface without removing material; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of removing surface soil/sediment to restore or create freshwater marshes. Four studies were in the USA. One study was in the Netherlands. One study was in Japan.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY                             

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by removing excess soil/sediment (along with other interventions) typically contained a different overall plant community, after 1–12 years, to both degraded and natural marshes nearby. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply reported changes in the overall plant community composition over four years after stripping topsoil (along with other interventions).
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of dune slacks in the Netherlands reported that overall plant species richness was greater in restored slacks (topsoil stripped five years previously, along with other interventions) than in mature unmanaged slacks. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that freshwater marshes being restored by removing topsoil (along with other interventions) contained fewer wetland plant species, after 1–12 years, than nearby natural marshes. Two studies (including one site comparison) in freshwater marshes in the USA and Japan reported that the effect of removing topsoil on overall plant species richness depended on the amount removed.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study of a floodplain marsh in Japan found that where stripped plots were colonized by plants within two growing seasons, they contained more wetland-characteristic species than an adjacent unstripped area. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply reported the number of characteristic plant species present over five years after stripping topsoil (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (3 studies): Three studies (two replicated) in the Netherlands, the USA and Japan simply quantified the overall abundance of vegetation that colonized – within five years – freshwater wetlands stripped of topsoil (sometimes along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant abundance (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated) in freshwater marshes in the USA and Japan simply quantified the abundance of wetland-characteristic plant species that colonized – within five years – areas stripped of topsoil.
Individual species abundance (5 studies): Five studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that pothole wetlands restored by removing excess sediment (sometimes along with planting herbs) had lower hybrid cattail Typha x glauca cover than unrestored wetlands after 2–7 years, and similar hybrid cattail cover to nearby natural wetlands. One replicated study of dune slacks in the Netherlands simply quantified the cover of individual species present over five years after stripping topsoil (along with other interventions). Only two species had &gt;1% cover in any slack.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One study in a freshwater marsh in the USA reported that the effect of removing topsoil on the abundance of tall vegetation depended on the amount removed.
Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of pothole wetlands in the USA found that the effect of removing excess sediment (sometimes along with planting herbs) on horizontal vegetation cover, 2–7 years later, depended on the elevation/vegetation zone.
Height (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that sedge tussocks were shorter in a wet meadow restored by removing excess sediment (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that sedge tussocks had a smaller perimeter in a wet meadow restored by removing excess sediment (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in natural meadows, after 11–14 years.
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study in the USA reported that the basal area of sedge tussocks was smaller in a wet meadow restored by removing excess sediment (along with other interventions, including planting sedges) than in nearby natural meadows, after 11–14 years.

3225: Bury surface soil/sediment
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In degraded marshes or swamps, the surface soil/sediment – and any vegetation on it – could be buried under deeper layers, for instance by deep ploughing. Burial can create bare soil/sediment with spaces for vegetation to grow, prevent undesirable plants from growing from seeds already in the soil, remove excess nutrients that favour growth of undesirable weedy plants, and remove any contaminants or pollutants (Glen et al. 2017). Inverting, rather than removing, the upper soil layer maintains the ground level.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment without replacement (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Disturb soil/sediment surface (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Bury surface soil/sediment before planting.

3226: Disturb soil/sediment surface: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment in degraded marshes (e.g. by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying) without permanently removing any material. Such disturbance may encourage the growth of desirable plants. It can break up any hard soil crust, or create bare patches clear of competing vegetation or litter in which new plants can grow. Marsh plants may colonize from nearby habitat patches, or germinate from propagules (e.g. seeds, spores or root/rhizome fragments) already in the soil. The first colonizing plants will typically be fast-growing, weedy species – but these may also be desirable members of target plant communities, or act as nurse plants for later desirable communities.
Related actions: Physically damage problematic plants, including by disturbing the soil/sediment; Remove surface soil/sediment; Bury surface soil/sediment, including by deep ploughing.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of freshwater marshes. Both studies were in the USA – in the same region but different sites.

3227: Disturb soil/sediment surface: brackish/salt marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment in degraded marshes (e.g. by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying) without permanently removing any material. Such disturbance may encourage the growth of desirable plants. It can break up any hard soil crust, or create bare patches clear of competing vegetation or litter in which new plants can grow. Marsh plants may colonize from nearby habitat patches, or germinate from propagules (e.g. seeds, spores or root/rhizome fragments) already in the soil. The first colonizing plants will typically be fast-growing, weedy species – but these may also be desirable members of target plant communities, or act as nurse plants for later desirable communities.
Related actions: Physically damage problematic plants, including by disturbing the soil/sediment; Remove surface soil/sediment; Bury surface soil/sediment, including by deep ploughing.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/salt marshes. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study of brackish/salt marshes in the USA reported that marshes disked every spring for at least six years (and drawn down during spring/autumn) shared only 24–34% of plant species with marshes that were not disked (or drawn down).
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that overall plant species richness and diversity were similar in managed marshes (disked every spring and drawn down during spring/autumn, for at least six years) and unmanaged marshes (neither disked nor drawn down).

3230: Add sediment: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding small amounts of sediment to marshes is a possible action to counter multiple threats. These include: sea level rise; subsidence (e.g. following oil and gas extraction); reduced sediment inputs following the construction of levees, flood control structures or jetties; and erosion from storms or boat traffic or following excessive grazing (Reed & Wilson 2004). Adding sediment can physically raise the ground surface and provide nutrients to vegetation. In turn, vegetation can physically protect and stabilize wetlands, and encourage further sediment deposition. Sediment or sediment slurry could be added directly to a focal site, or placed nearby then transported to the focal site by natural process (Foster 2013).
Factors that might influence the effects of this action include the amount of sediment added, and whether any vegetation is present before sediment addition.
Related actions: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical habitat structure; Transplant or replace wetland soil in order to introduce marsh vegetation.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding sediment to existing brackish/salt marshes. All five studies were in the USA. Two studies were based on one experimental set-up and two studies were based on another.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically supported a greater relative abundance of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora than degraded marshes after two years, but that this typically remained lower than in natural marshes.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically had greater plant species richness than degraded marshes, and statistically similar richness to natural marshes, after two years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that salt marshes amended with sediment typically had greater total vegetation cover than degraded marshes, and statistically similar cover to natural marshes, after two years.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, all four studies (including two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled) of salt marshes in the USA found that adding sediment typically increased the abundance of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, over approximately 1–5 years. This is based on total biomass, density and/or cover. One of the studies reported that adding sediment increased the cover of three other species after one year.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a salt marsh in the USA found that the height of the dominant plant species, smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, did not significantly differ between plots amended with sediment and unamended plots. Height was measured 16 months after sediment amendment began.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Topsoil can be a source of soil organic matter and help to improve water retention (Bruland & Richardson 2004). This might benefit wetland vegetation, particularly when creating new marshes and swamps. However, given that upland soil will probably not contain seeds or fragments or marsh/swamp plants, it may be necessary to introduce these in some way. Caution: Topsoil may contain seeds or fragments of undesirable vegetation.
Related actions: Transplant or replace wetland soil (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Add upland topsoil to complement planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

3235: Deposit soil/sediment to form physical structure of freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves large-scale deposition of soil or sediment to form the physical structure of a marsh. This can be a cost-effective alternative to depositing sediment in upland areas or in the ocean (LaSalle et al. 1991). Soil or sediment could be placed directly where a marsh is desired, or placed nearby then carried to the desired site by water flows (Foster et al. 2013). Summarized studies could vary in the degree of landscaping of the newly deposited sediment.
Related actions: Deposit soil/sediment and introduce vegetation; Add sediment in relatively small amounts; Add upland topsoil; Transplant or replace wetland soil in order to introduce marsh vegetation.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One replicated study in a lagoon in Italy quantified the area of vegetation on sediment deposited up to 19 years previously (average six years four months, with 61% vegetation coverage).
Community types (2 studies): Two replicated studies in coastal wetlands in the USA and Italy quantified the coverage of brackish or salt marsh plant communities on sediment deposited up to 19 years previously.
Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study on the coast of the USA reported that the composition of the plant community that developed on deposited sediment depended on the time since deposition and the elevation of the sediment. Areas of sediment that were of a similar elevation to natural marshes (or slightly lower) developed (or were developing) a similar overall plant community composition to the natural marshes.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated study in an estuary in the USA reported that 1–2 plant species had colonized areas of deposited sediment after 4–8 years.

3239: Add inorganic fertilizer: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fertilizers can be used to manage nutrient availability and may speed up revegetation. Plant growth might be limited by a lack of nutrients overall, or of a specific nutrient, after drainage, mining, vegetation harvest or pollution. When one or two nutrients are overabundant, invasive plant species may benefit more than native species. Adding the less abundant nutrients may shift the competitive balance back towards native species (Tilman et al. 1999; Perry et al. 2004). Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K). It may be sensible to add fertilizer when the focal site is not flooded, to reduce the risk of it dissolving or being washed away.
The effects of this action will be heavily dependent on the study context, especially initial site nutrient levels and the amount of fertilizer added. Adding fertilizer when nutrients are already abundant could cause more harm than good, encouraging the growth of undesirable plants or algae and even inhibiting plant growth (Weinbaum et al. 1992). Accordingly, studies testing the effects of nutrient enrichment as a threat (i.e. enrichment above normal or desirable levels) are not summarized as evidence.

It may be sensible to add fertilizer when the focal site is not flooded, to reduce the risk of it dissolving or being washed away.
The effects of this action will be heavily dependent on the study context, especially initial site nutrient levels and the amount of fertilizer added. Adding fertilizer when nutrients are already abundant could cause more harm than good, encouraging the growth of undesirable plants or algae and even inhibiting plant growth (Weinbaum et al. 1992). Accordingly, studies testing the effects of nutrient enrichment as a threat (i.e. enrichment above normal or desirable levels) are not summarized as evidence.

3243: Add below-ground organic matter: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves adding organic matter (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) below the ground surface, for example by mixing it into the sediment or placing it into holes. Specific substances than can be used include compost, sewage sludge, wood chips and seaweed extract.
The soil organic matter content of wetland soils may be reduced by disturbance. For example, drainage allows oxygen into the soil, whilst reprofiling removes surface layers rich in organic matter (Bruland et al. 2006). Organic matter can be an important component of wetland soils. It directly supplies nutrients to growing plants, supplies carbon and energy to soil organisms, helps bind the soil together, retains water during dry periods, and mediates soil temperature (Donahue et al. 1983; Weil & Brady 2016). Adding carbon-rich organic materials can indirectly modify nutrient availability by stimulating microbial activity, and so could help to manage invasive species where they benefit from an excess of certain nutrients (Reever Morghan & Seastedt 1999; Tilman et al. 1999; Perry et al. 2004).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must evaluate the effects of adding organic matter without adding living vegetation. The organic matter should be used to help or manage existing vegetation, such as remnant patches of vegetation, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already present.

3247: Add surface mulch: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Organic mulches (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can be placed on the surface of wetlands to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for vegetation establishment and growth. Mulches can also help to manage acidification by excluding oxygen from sediments and stimulating microbial processes that neutralize the acidity (Baldwin 2011). Carbon-rich organic matter may also help to shift the competitive balance away from invasive species in polluted environments, enriched in certain nutrients (Reever Morghan & Seastedt 1999; Tilman et al. 1999; Perry et al. 2004). Examples of substances than can be used as mulches include compost, straw, seagrass leaves and seaweed (macroalgae).
Caution: It may be necessary to sterilize mulch before applying it, with heat or radiation, to kill propagules of undesirable plants. Adding organic matter as a mulch may be less labour intensive than mixing it into the soil or sediment, but increases the risk of the material being washed away.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have added mulch that is largely free from plant propagules. The mulch should be used to help or manage existing vegetation, such as remnant patches of vegetation, or seedlings that germinate from seeds already present.
Related actions: Use covers/barriers to control problematic plants; Add cover other than mulch during marsh restoration/creation; Add surface mulch to complement planting.

3252: Introduce nurse plants: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Nurse plants (also known as companion plants or pioneer plants) can be planted to help naturally recolonizing vegetation (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants may trap and stabilize sediments, trap propagules, reduce harsh environmental conditions (e.g. temperature fluctuations and strong sunlight), attract pollinators, deflect herbivory away from focal species, and/or limit weed establishment. Caution: Nurse plant species must be chosen carefully. Species that spread easily or are very strong competitors can cause more harm than good. For example, the non-native mangrove apple Sonneratia apetala has been used to restore Chinese mangroves, but has spread into neighbouring forests (Ren et al. 2009).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have reported the effects of the nurse plants on other vegetation, not just the survival or growth of the nurse plants. Studies must have explicitly planted vegetation for its nursing effect. Studies are summarized under other interventions if (a) the nurse plant is itself a desirable part of the final plant community, (b) if vegetation other than nurse plants is introduced, or (c) desirable vegetation is planted into existing nurse vegetation. Studies of the nursing effect of existing vegetation (e.g. Lewis & Dunstan 1975; McKee et al. 2007) are outside the scope of this synopsis.

3254: Introduce nurse plants: freshwater swamps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Nurse plants (also known as companion plants or pioneer plants) can be planted to help naturally recolonizing vegetation (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants may trap and stabilize sediments, trap propagules, reduce harsh environmental conditions (e.g. temperature fluctuations and strong sunlight), attract pollinators, deflect herbivory away from focal species, and/or limit weed establishment. Caution: Nurse plant species must be chosen carefully. Species that spread easily or are very strong competitors can cause more harm than good. For example, the non-native mangrove apple Sonneratia apetala has been used to restore Chinese mangroves, but has spread into neighbouring forests (Ren et al. 2009).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have reported the effects of the nurse plants on other vegetation, not just the survival or growth of the nurse plants. Studies must have explicitly planted vegetation for its nursing effect. Studies are summarized under other interventions if (a) the nurse plant is itself a desirable part of the final plant community, (b) if vegetation other than nurse plants is introduced, or (c) desirable vegetation is planted into existing nurse vegetation. Studies of the nursing effect of existing vegetation (e.g. Lewis & Dunstan 1975; McKee et al. 2007) are outside the scope of this synopsis.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE
 
VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that the average height of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses increased by 21–90% (depending on the species) over the first month after establishment.

OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One study on an estuarine mudflat in India reported that 60–80% (depending on the species) of mangrove propagules trapped by nurse grasses developed into seedlings. Saltmarsh grasses trapped 1,200–1,372 mangrove propagules/m2/week, approximately 1–2 years after they were planted.

3256: Directly plant non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves planting whole emergent plants, directly into soil or sediment, to restore/create marshes or swamps. These plants might be individual seedlings, rooted cuttings or mature plants. Plants may be raised in greenhouses/laboratories, or collected from natural sites (with potential damage to donor site; Laegdsgaard 2002).
Introduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. However, note that up-front costs can be high.
The effects of planting may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when was vegetation planted? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the environmental conditions over the duration of the study?
The scope of this action does not include planting nurse plants; planting submerged or floating plants; planting to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); planting facultative wetland plants in upland sites; or planting for commercial purposes (e.g. mangrove plantations; Kaly & Jones 1998). In contrast, the scope does include planting non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).
Related actions: Introduce vegetation fragments; Introduce seeds or propagules; Transplant or replace blocks of vegetation; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Introduce organisms to control problematic plants; Introduce nurse plants; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including planting.

Key Messages:

Twenty-four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting emergent, non-woody plants in freshwater wetlands. Sixteen studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Guam, the Netherlands, Israel, Ireland, the UK, Italy, Australia and China. Two pairs of studies in Minnesota and South Dakota took place in the same area but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their near-shore plant community became more similar to that behind mature natural rush stands.
Overall richness/diversity (9 studies): Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled) in freshwater marshes in China and the USA reported that planting herbs increased plant species richness and/or diversity for up to five years. Two controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that planted and unplanted sites had similar plant species richness after 2–3 years. Three studies in the USA, the UK and Australia compared plant species richness in marshes that had been planted with herbs (sometimes along with other interventions) and natural marshes, and reported that it was never higher in planted marshes. Three studies involving freshwater marshes in Guam, the USA and Italy simply quantified plant species richness for up to 13 years after planting herbs (along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with wetland-characteristic herbs had a similar richness of wetland-characteristic plant species, after three years, to unplanted plots.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): One before-and-after study of a freshwater marsh and wet meadow in China found that vegetation cover was greater five years after planting herbs than in the year before planting. One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with herbs had similar overall vegetation cover, after three years, to unplanted plots. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia found that as planted rush stands aged, the density of plants in adjacent near-shore vegetation became more similar to mature natural stands. One study in a freshwater marsh in the USA simply quantified vegetation cover and density over 1–9 years after planting herbs (along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that plots planted with wetland-characteristic herbs had greater cover of wetland-characteristic plants, after three years, than unplanted plots.
Individual species abundance (13 studies): Thirteen studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one replicated, paired, controlled study in freshwater wetlands in the USA found that both planted herb species had greater cover in planted than unplanted plots, after three years. Three studies in the UK, the USA and Australia compared the abundance of herb species where they had been planted to their abundance in natural marshes: two found that the planted species was more dense in planted than natural areas after 5–14 years, and one found that planted rush stands became more dense (i.e. more like natural stands) as they aged.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their width increased – becoming more like mature natural stands.
Height (4 studies): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their maximum height increased – becoming more like mature natural stands. One before-and-after study of a freshwater marsh and wet meadow in China found that vegetation was taller five years after planting herbs than in the year before planting. One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow were shorter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions). One replicated study in wet basins in the USA simply reported an increase in the average height of a herb species over three growing seasons after it was planted.
Diameter/perimeter/area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that sedge tussocks in a restored meadow had a smaller perimeter than sedge tussocks in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions).
Basal area (1 study): One site comparison study of wet meadows in the USA reported that the basal area of sedge tussocks was lower in a restored meadow than in natural meadows, 11–14 years after planting (along with other interventions).
Individual plant size (2 studies): Two replicated studies in wet meadow restoration sites in the USA reported that the size of Carex stricta seedlings increased over two months or three growing seasons after planting. This was true for the average number of shoots/plant and biomass/plant.

OTHER

Survival (14 studies): Nine studies (eight replicated) in the USA and Israel quantified survival rates of individual herbs planted in freshwater wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 1–3 growing seasons. Eight studies (including five replicated and two before-and-after) in Guam, the USA, the Netherlands and Israel reported 0% survival or absence of planted (or sown) herb species, in at least some cases, after three months to seven years. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, herbivory, time of planting and plug type.
Growth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual herbs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The two studies (one replicated) in Ireland and the USA reported that herbs grew over 1–2 growing seasons after planting.

Key Messages:

Thirty studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting emergent, non-woody plants in brackish/saline wetlands. Twenty-four studies were in the USA. There was one study in each of Canada, New Zealand, Spain, Italy and Australia. One study was a global systematic review. Four of the studies monitored different outcomes of one planting experiment in California. Two other studies used the same marsh as each other. Two studies shared some plots with each other.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their near-shore plant community became more similar to that behind mature natural rush stands.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled study on a brackish sandflat in the USA reported that an area planted with wetland herbs contained more plant species, after eight years, than an adjacent unplanted area. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia found that the near-shore vegetation behind &gt;8-year-old planted rush stands and mature natural stands contained a similar number of plant species. One study of a fresh/brackish/saline marsh in Italy simply quantified plant species richness for up to 13 years after planting herbs (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) of brackish/saline marshes in the USA reported that areas planted with herbs (sometimes along with other interventions) contained less vegetation, after 2–3 growing seasons, than nearby natural marshes. This was true for biomass and cover. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia found that the density of near-shore vegetation behind older planted rush stands was similar to that behind mature natural stands. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuary in the USA reported that plots planted with salt marsh vegetation contained more vegetation biomass than unplanted plots, after three growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (18 studies): Eighteen studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Four studies in the USA compared the abundance of plant species in planted and unplanted areas. Two replicated studies found that planted herb species were typically more abundant in planted than unplanted plots, after 2–4 growing seasons. One replicated, paired, controlled study reported that there were fewer common reed Phragmites australis stems in plots planted with other wetland herbs (and shrubs) than in unplanted plots, after 1–3 years. One replicated, randomized, controlled study reported species-specific effects of planted individuals on recruitment of conspecific seedlings. Nine studies in the USA and Australia compared the abundance of herb species where they had been planted to their abundance in natural brackish/saline marshes. Results varied between studies, species, metrics and time since planting. One before-and-after study of an intertidal site in the USA reported greater abundance of smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora over five years after planting (along with other interventions) than before. Seven studies (six replicated) in brackish/saline marshes in the USA and Canada simply quantified the abundance of individual species over 1–3 growing seasons after they were planted (sometimes along with other interventions).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, site comparison study in a salt marsh in the USA found that plots planted with herbs contained more canopy layers than unplanted plots after 2–4 growing seasons. One replicated, site comparison study around fresh/brackish lakes in Australia reported that as planted rush stands aged, their width increased – becoming more similar to mature natural stands.
Height (11 studies): Three replicated studies in salt marshes in the USA found that vegetation in areas planted with herbs was at least as tall as vegetation in unplanted areas, 2–4 growing seasons after planting. Of six site comparison studies that compared vegetation height in planted and natural marshes (sometimes along with other interventions), three studies in the USA reported that vegetation was shorter in planted marshes after 2–5 growing seasons. Two studies in the USA and Australia found that vegetation was typically a similar height in planted and natural marshes after 2–11 years. One study in the USA found that vegetation was taller in planted marshes after three growing seasons. Four replicated studies in brackish/saline marshes in the USA simply quantified the height of herbs over 1–5 growing seasons after they were planted; in three of these studies, the average height increased over time.

OTHER

Survival (17 studies): Seventeen studies (including 13 replicated and one systematic review) in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and multiple countries quantified survival rates of individual herbs planted (or sown) in brackish/saline wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 20 days to 2 years. Four studies in the USA, New Zealand and multiple countries reported 0% survival or absence of planted herb species, in at least some cases, after nine months to eight years. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, age of planted individuals, treatment with root dip, planting date, soil pH, damage by waterbirds, salinity and sediment organic matter content.
Growth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual herbs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). One replicated study in a brackish marsh in the USA reported that in 8 of 10 cases, rushes/bulrushes grew in both height and circumference over the second year after planting. One replicated study in an estuary in Spain reported growth of planted small cordgrass Spartina maritima and glasswort Sarcocornia perennis over the year after planting.

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting trees/shrubs in freshwater wetlands. Fifteen studies were in the USA. Two were in Australia. Two of the studies took place in the same site, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (2 studies): Two replicated studies of freshwater wetlands in the USA found that planting trees/shrubs (sometimes along with other interventions) had no significant effect on aspects of plant community composition, after 1–11 years. Specifically, planted and unplanted wetlands had a similar proportion of species in different plant groups and relative abundance of different plant groups.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in depressional wetlands in the USA found that wetlands sparsely planted with tree seedlings contained a similar number of plant species, after 1–4 years, to unplanted wetlands.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one site comparison; one randomized, controlled, before-and-after) of freshwater wetlands in the USA found that planting trees/shrubs (sometimes along with other interventions) had no significant effect on overall vegetation cover (both ground and canopy, separately or combined) after 1–11 years.
Herb abundance (1 study): One study in a former firing range in the USA simply quantified herb cover approximately 1–2 years after reprofiling the site and planting trees/shrubs.
Tree/shrub abundance (1 study): One study in a former firing range in the USA simply quantified woody plant cover approximately 1–2 years after reprofiling the site and planting trees/shrubs.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Visual obstruction (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) had less horizontal vegetation cover, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.
Height (6 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) contained shorter woody vegetation, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging. Herbaceous vegetation, however, was of similar height. Five studies (four replicated) in freshwater wetlands in the USA simply quantified the height of trees and shrubs over 1–6 growing seasons after they were planted; in four of these studies, the average height typically increased over time.
Diameter (1 study): One study in a freshwater wetland in the USA reported an increase in the diameter of surviving trees over the year after they were planted.
Basal area (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that swamps created by planting trees/shrubs (after reprofiling) had a lower vegetation basal area, after 7–11 years, than nearby swamps recovering naturally from logging.

OTHER

Survival (15 studies): Fifteen studies (including eight replicated) in the USA and Australia quantified survival of individual trees/shrubs planted in freshwater wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 4–66 months. Seven of the studies (including six replicated) in the USA and Australia reported 0% survival of planted vegetation in at least some cases, after 1–6 growing seasons. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, the season of planting, protection from herbivores, root pruning, extreme weather, and if/how invasive vegetation was removed before planting.
Growth (2 studies): Two studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The two studies, in freshwater wetlands in the USA, reported that planted trees grew in diameter and/or height over their first 1–2 growing seasons.

Key Messages:

Forty-seven studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of directly planting trees/shrubs in brackish/saline wetlands. Forty-four studies involved planting mangroves or other coastal swamp trees: 20 in Asia, seven in Central America, six in Africa, four in North America, four in South America, two in Oceania and one globally. Three studies involved planting shrubs in the USA or Spain. There was overlap in the sites used in two studies. One systematic review included several of the other summarized studies.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (3 studies): Two before-and-after studies in India and South Africa reported that the area of mangrove forest was greater 6–42 years after planting mangrove trees (sometimes along with other interventions) than in the years before. One study in Sri Lanka simply quantified the area of mangrove vegetation present 8–10 years after planting seedlings (and propagules).
Tree/shrub richness/diversity (6 studies): Three site comparison studies in the USA, Mexico and Brazil reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes along with other interventions), they contained a similar number of tree species to mature and/or naturally regenerating forests after 10–30 years. One site comparison study in Vietnam reported that after 14–34 years, a planted mangrove forest contained more tree species than a (slightly older) naturally regenerated forest. One replicated, paired, before-and-after, site comparison study in Kenya reported that planted mangrove forest contained fewer adult tree species than mature natural forest after five years, but more species of seedling. One study in a former shrimp pond in Thailand simply reported the number of unplanted tree species that had colonized six years after planting (along with other interventions).

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (9 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Philippines, the USA and Brazil reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes along with other interventions), woody vegetation was typically more dense than in mature natural forests and/or naturally regenerating forests. Two site comparison studies in Kenya and Vietnam found that tree abundance (density and biomass) was similar in planted and natural mangroves after 5–34 years. One site comparison study in Mexico reported that a planted mangrove forest contained fewer trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Two site comparison studies in the Philippines reported mixed results according to time since planting and site. One study in Thailand simply quantified the abundance of mangrove trees six years after planting (along with other interventions).
Algae/phytoplankton abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in Kenya found that mangrove forests restored by planting contained a similar algal biomass, after eight years, to mature natural forests. However, mangrove forests created by planting into bare sediment contained less algal biomass than mature natural forests.
Individual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. Four of the studies compared the abundance of woody vegetation or algae in planted mangrove forests and mature natural forests – and sometimes naturally regenerating forests (see original papers for data). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a brackish wetland in the USA reported that there were fewer common reed Phragmites australis stems in plots planted with wetland shrubs (and herbs) than in unplanted plots, after 1–3 years. One before-and-after study of an intertidal site in the USA reported greater abundance of red mangrove Rhizophora mangle over five years after planting (along with other interventions) than before.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the Kenya, the USA and the Philippines reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes along with other interventions), their overall structure differed from mature natural forests for up to 50 years.
Height (18 studies): Four site comparison studies (three replicated, three paired) of coastal sites in Kenya, the USA, Brazil and the Philippines reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (sometimes along with other interventions), the vegetation was shorter than in mature and naturally regenerating forests after 5–30 years. One site comparison study in Mexico reported that planted mangrove forests contained taller trees than pristine natural forests after 12 years. Fourteen studies (four replicated) in Asia, Central/South America, Africa and North America simply quantified the height of mangrove trees for up to six years after they were planted; in 13 of these studies, the average height increased over time.
Diameter (7 studies): Two site comparison studies in Mexio and Vietnam reported that tree diameters were similar in planted and natural mangroves after 12–34 years. In contrast, two site comparison studies in Brazil and the Philippines reported that planted mangroves contained thinner tree stems than mature natural mangroves after 7–12 years. The study in Brazil also reported that stem diameters were thinner than in naturally regenerating areas. Three studies in India and Nigeria simply quantified the diameter of mangrove trees for up to three years after they were planted; in all three studies, the average stem diameter increased over time.
Basal area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one also replicated, paired, before-and-after) in Kenya and Mexico reported that planted mangrove forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests after 5–12 years. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting trees (along with other interventions), their basal area was similar to mature natural forests after 17–30 years.

OTHER

Survival (37 studies): Thirty-six studies (including one review and one systematic review) quantified survival rates of individual trees/shrubs planted in brackish/saline wetlands. Survival rates ranged from 0% to 100% after 15 days to 21 years. The studies were of mangroves in North America, Central/South America, Asia, Africa, Oceania or globally, and of shrubs in the USA or Spain. Six studies reported 100% survival in some cases. Eleven studies reported 0% survival or absence of planted species in some cases. In six studies, survival of planted seedlings was not distinguished from survival of seeds or propagules. Proposed factors affecting survival included elevation/water levels, exposure to wind/waves, soil properties, sediment deposition, oyster/barnacle colonization, salinity, use of guidance and post-planting care.
Growth (9 studies): Nine studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). The nine studies, in Colombia, the USA, the Philippines, Brazil and China, reported that planted trees/shrubs typically grew, over periods from 40 days to 50 years. One replicated study in the USA reported that planted seedlings grew less quickly than naturally colonizing seedlings. One replicated, site comparison study in the Philippines found that growth rates of trees in planted mangroves became more similar to those in mature natural mangroves over time.


Synopsis Details:
Title: Marsh and Swamp Conservation
Description: Marsh and Swamp Synopsis
3260: Introduce fragments of non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves introducing fragments of non-woody emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. This includes unrooted cuttings, roots, tubers/bulbs/corms (underground storage organs), rhizomes (underground horizontal stems) or stolons/runners (above-ground horizontal stems). Vegetation fragments may be planted directly into the soil, or spread on the soil surface. Fragments may be obtained from plants raised in greenhouses/laboratories, or collected from natural sites (with potential damage to donor site; Laegdsgaard 2002).
Introduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. However, note that up-front costs can be high.
The effects of planting may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were fragments introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the environmental conditions over the duration of the study?
The scope of this action does not include planting nurse plants; planting submerged or floating plants; planting to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); or planting facultative wetland plants in upland sites. In contrast, the scope does include planting non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing fragments of emergent, non-woody plants to freshwater wetlands. Three studies were in the USA. Two studies were in one marsh in Australia, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that plots planted with wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma had similar overall vegetation cover to unplanted plots after one year. One of the studies continued for longer, and found that planted plots had greater overall vegetation cover than unplanted plots after three years.
Herb abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that plots planted with wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma had similar overall sedge/grass cover to unplanted plots after one year.
Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, of two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a floodplain marsh in Australia, one found that wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma was more frequent and had greater cover, after 1–3 years, in plots where its runners had been planted than where they had not been planted. The other study reported that wick grass cover was present, with approximately 1% cover, in 5 of 10 plots where its runners had been planted. This study monitored vegetation one year after planting.

OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that planting wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma had no significant effect on the germination rate of invasive mimosa Mimosa pigra over three years.
Survival (5 studies): Two replicated studies planted sedge Carex fragments into freshwater wetlands in the USA. One study reported 38–79% survival of planted tubers over one growing season, whilst the other study reported 0–73% survival of planted rhizomes after 1–9 months. One replicated study in a tidal freshwater marsh in the USA reported that 6–31% of planted California bulrush Schoenoplectus californicus rhizomes had produced shoots after three months. For two other species, all planted rhizomes died within three months. Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a floodplain marsh in Australia reported absence of planted wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma from 17–50% of plots after one year.

3264: Introduce seeds of non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves introducing seeds of emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. Seeds may be collected from plants in greenhouses/laboratories, or from natural sites. They may be sown directly into the soil, scattered over the surface, or carried to suitable sites by water (e.g. after dropping them into the sea during an incoming tide).
Introduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. Seeds are easier to handle than plants, and can be a cost-effective way to introduce vegetation to large areas – but they can be more susceptible to herbivory or being washed away (e.g. Schoenholz et al. 2001).
The effects of sowing may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were seeds introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the conditions over the duration of the study?

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing seeds of emergent, non-woody plants to freshwater wetlands. Eleven studies were in the USA. Two studies were in Australia. Two of the studies were based on exactly the same set of pools. Two sets of studies in the USA and Australia used the same general sites, but different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study of created wetlands in the USA reported that wetlands sown with herb (and some shrub) seeds contained a different overall plant community to unsown wetlands, after 1–2 years.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that wetlands sown with herb (and some shrub) seeds had higher plant diversity than unsown wetlands, after 1–2 years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (4 studies): Three replicated studies (two also randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in wetlands in the USA and Australia found that plots sown with herb seeds (and in one study, some shrub seeds) had similar overall vegetation cover to unsown plots, after 1–3 years. One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported that vegetation biomass developed over 15 months after sowing mixed herb seeds. Biomass included all the sown species.
Characteristic plant abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies of recently excavated ephemeral pools in the USA found that native, pool-characteristic species were more common, over seven years, in pools where they were sown than where they were not sown. One of the studies found that this was true when a mixture of characteristic species were densely sown, but not when a single species was sparsely sown. One replicated, before-and-after study in experimental wet basins in the USA quantified the overall density of target sedge meadow species, in the vegetation that developed over 16 weeks after sowing.
Herb abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that plots sown with herb seeds had similar overall sedge/grass cover to unsown plots, after 1–3 years.
Individual species abundance (8 studies): Eight studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, four replicated, before-and-after studies in Australia and the USA reported that sown herb species were absent from plots in some cases, after 1–3 years. The two studies in Australia reported low abundance (&lt;20% frequency and &lt;2% cover) of wick grass Hymenachne acutigluma 1–3 years after sowing its seeds – although in one of the studies this was greater than in unsown plots.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated study in the USA reported data on cordgrass height, for up to three growing seasons after sowing.

OTHER           

Germination/emergence (4 studies): Two replicated studies in the USA reported ≤1–61% germination of grass-like plants and forbs, after their seeds were sown onto wetlands. Another replicated study in the USA reported that seeds of six wetland herb species did not germinate when sown into a floodplain where an invasive plant was present (but being controlled). One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a floodplain marsh in Australia found that sowing herb seeds had no significant effect on the number of invasive mimosa Mimosa pigra seedlings germinating, for up to three years.
Survival (6 studies): Six studies in freshwater wetlands in Australia and the USA reported absence of sown (or planted) herb species, in at least some cases, after one month to seven years. It is not always clear whether this reflects death of seedlings or failure of seeds to germinate.

Key Messages:

Eight studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing seeds of emergent, non-woody plants to brackish/saline wetlands. There were three studies in the USA, two in the Netherlands and two in China. The other study was a global systematic review.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (4 studies): Four replicated studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. One study in an estuary in China also gave a before-and-after comparison, and reported higher density and biomass of seablite Suaeda salsa five months after sowing its seeds than on the bare sediment present before sowing.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated study on a mudflat in the Netherlands reported that the average height of surviving common cordgrass Spartina anglica plants increased, between one and six months after sowing cordgrass seeds.

OTHER           

Germination/emergence (5 studies): Five replicated studies in the Netherlands, the USA and China quantified germination rates of seeds sown into intertidal areas. Some seeds germinated in all five studies, at a rate of &lt;1% to 25%. Two studies reported that no seeds germinated for some species and/or in some environments.
Survival (3 studies): One replicated study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands quantified survival rates of individual germinated seedlings: 0–83% over their first growing season, depending on species and site conditions. Another replicated study in a salt marsh in the Netherlands reported that after two growing seasons, common cordgrass Spartina anglica was absent from 90% of plots in which had been sown. One global systematic review reported variable survival of herbs sown (or planted) in salt marshes: 0% to ≥95% after 20 days to 13 years, depending on the study.

3266: Introduce tree/shrub seeds or propagules: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves introducing seeds or propagules of emergent plants to restore/create marshes or swamps. “Propagules” is the term used to describe the seed-like, usually leafless structures produced by mangrove trees to allow them to reproduce and disperse. Seeds or propagules may be collected from plants in greenhouses/laboratories, or from natural sites. They may be sown directly into the soil, scattered over the surface, or carried to suitable sites by water (e.g. after dropping them into the sea during an incoming tide).
Introduction of target vegetation might be useful in severely degraded or bare sites – which may lack remnant plants or seed banks to kick start revegetation with desirable species, and may be at risk of being taken over by undesirable species (Brown & Bedford 1997). It might also be useful in isolated wetlands, far from sources of marsh or swamp plant propagules. Seeds and propagules are easier to handle than plants, and can be a cost-effective way to introduce vegetation to large areas – but they can be more susceptible to herbivory or being washed away (e.g. Schoenholz et al. 2001).
The effects of sowing may be highly dependent on the environmental conditions in each study. Questions you might ask when interpreting the evidence include: Is the study site degraded? Where and when were seeds/propagules introduced? Was there any intervention to improve conditions before planting? What were the conditions over the duration of the study?
The scope of this action does not include sowing nurse plants; sowing submerged or floating plants; sowing to restore bogs, fens, fen meadows or peat swamp forests (see Taylor et al. 2018); or sowing facultative wetland plants in upland sites. In contrast, the scope does include sowing non-native species to conserve marshes or swamps – whilst acknowledging that this is often considered ethically unacceptable due to the risk of invasion (e.g. Ren et al. 2009).
Related actions: Directly plant whole plants; Introduce vegetation fragments; Transplant or replace wetland soil; Restore/create marshes or swamps using multiple interventions, often including planting.

Key Messages:

Nineteen studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of introducing seeds or propagules of trees/shrubs to brackish/saline wetlands. All 19 studies involved planting mangrove propagules: seven in Asia, five in North America, three in Central America, two in Oceania, one in South America and one globally. Three studies in the USA shared some study sites.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (2 studies): Two studies in the USA and Sri Lanka simply quantified the area of mangrove vegetation present 6–14 years after planting propagules (along with other interventions).
Relative abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the USA reported that mangrove forests created by planting propagules (after reprofiling) supported a different relative abundance of tree species to natural forests, after 7–15 years.
Tree/shrub richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA reported that mangrove forests created by planting propagules (along with other interventions) contained a similar number of tree species to mature natural forests, after 7–30 years.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Tree/shrub abundance (3 studies): Three replicated, site comparison studies of coastal sites in the USA and the Philippines reported that where mangrove forests developed after planting propagules (along with other interventions), trees were typically more dense than in mature natural forests.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Overall structure (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA reported that mangrove forests created by planting propagules (along with other interventions) had a different overall physical structure to mature natural forests, after 17–30 years.
Height (4 studies): Four studies (three replicated) in Thailand, the USA, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates simply quantified the height of surviving mangrove trees for up to 16 years after sowing seeds or planting propagules; in all of these studies, the average height increased over time.
Diameter/perimeter/area (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one also replicated and paired) in the USA reported that mangrove forests created by planting propagules (after reprofiling) contained thinner trees, on average, than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years. One study in a coastal area planted with mangrove propagules in Thailand reported that the average diameter of surviving seedlings increased over time.
Basal area (3 studies): Three site comparison studies (two also replicated, one also paired) in the USA compared mangrove forests created by planting propagules (along with other interventions) and mature natural forests. Two of the studies reported that planted forests had a smaller basal area than mature natural forests, after 7–18 years. The other study reported that planted forests had similar basal area to mature natural forests, after 17–30 years.

OTHER           

Germination/emergence (2 studies): One replicated study in the United Arab Emirates reported 65–92% germination of sown grey mangrove Avicennia marina seeds, across five coastal sites. One replicated study in a brackish/saline estuary in China reported 38–100% germination of planted mangrove propagules, depending on the species and habitat.
Survival (16 studies): Fifteen studies quantified survival of individual tree/shrub propagules planted in brackish/saline wetlands (or plants originating from them). All 15 studies were of mangroves: in Central/South America, Asia, North America, Oceania or gloablly. All reported survival in at least some cases, from 20 days to 30 years after planting. Five studies reported 100% survival in some cases. However, nine studies reported 0% survival or absence of planted species in some cases. In five studies, survival of seeds or propagules was not distinguished from survival of planted seedlings. Proposed factors affecting survival rates included elevation/water levels, substrate, invertebrate herbivory, use of tree shelters, mechanical stress, oyster colonization, use of guidance, post-planting care and repeated planting.
Growth (5 studies): Five studies monitored true growth of individual trees/shrubs (rather than changes in average height of survivors). All five studies (three replicated) in Australia, the USA, Colombia and the Philippines reported that mangrove seedlings, originating from planted seeds or propagules, grew over time.

3268: Transplant or replace blocks of vegetation: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves the introduction of vegetation as blocks or large sods, containing multiple individual plants. This technique might be used to introduce particular species to an already vegetated site, or to speed up the revegetation of a currently bare site. Blocks may be cut from a focal site, kept to one side during a disturbance, then replaced. Alternatively, blocks may be sourced from a separate donor site. When moving blocks from a donor site, it may be necessary to excavate the recipient site to avoid raising the soil surface.
Caution: This action inevitably causes damage to any donor site. Also, Transplanted blocks could contain invasive plants, animals or microorganisms. A possible solution to these problems is to use soil from healthy marshes or swamps that are earmarked for destruction. Using local donor sites could minimize the spread of invasive species, and make use of communities adapted to local conditions.
Effects of this action could be measured for the sods or vegetation overall (e.g. overall community composition of sods, or survival of sods) or for individual species or plants within the sods (e.g. height of the dominant grass species).
Related actions: Directly plant whole plants; Transplant or replace wetland soil.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of transplanting or replacing blocks of freshwater marsh vegetation. Three studies were in the USA. One study was in the UK.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted marshes in the USA found that plots of transplanted marsh vegetation contained a plant community characteristic of wetter conditions than plots without transplants after one growing season – but not after two.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK reported that plant species richness within transplanted freshwater marsh vegetation was similar before transplanting and six years later. There was a temporary increase in richness after one year. One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted freshwater marshes in the USA found that plots of transplanted marsh vegetation contained more wetland plant species than plots without transplants after one growing season – but that there was no significant difference after two.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted freshwater marshes in the USA found that plots of transplanted marsh vegetation had greater cover of wetland plants than plots without transplants, after 1–2 growing seasons.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in a wet prairie in the USA found that after three growing seasons, the density of prairie cordgrass Spartina pectinata stems was lower in transplanted sods than in pristine or source prairies. One before-and-after study of transplanted freshwater marsh vegetation in the UK reported changes in the frequency of individual plant species from before to six years after transplanting.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in a wet prairie in the USA found that after three growing seasons, prairie cordgrass Spartina pectinata was shorter in transplanted sods than in pristine or source prairies.
Diameter/perimeter/area (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated) in wet prairies in the USA found that the average area of small transplanted sods (≤0.28 m2 initial size) increased over 3–4 growing seasons. One of the studies transplanted larger sods (0.65 m2 initial size) and reported that their average area decreased over 3–4 growing seasons.

OTHER

Survival (2 studies): Two studies (one replicated) in wet prairies in the USA reported ≥90% survival of transplanted sods of wet prairie vegetation after 3–4 growing seasons.

3270: Transplant or replace wetland soil: freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Loose soil can be transplanted from a healthy marsh to one that is being created or restored. Soil could simply be added to a recipient site, or be used to replace material in the recipient site.
Soil transplants can be useful to introduce three key features of a healthy marsh (Anderson & Cowell 2004): (1) a chemically and physically suitable substrate for growth of wetland plants, (2) a mixture of soil organisms such as bacteria, fungi and invertebrates, and (3) a mixture of wetland vegetation (e.g. as seeds, roots, tubers or rhizomes). The vegetation within soil transplants may be more taxonomically and genetically diverse than that which could be introduced, given a fixed budget, by manual planting. However, note that excavating, moving and spreading soil can be expensive (Clewell 1981; Brown & Bedford 1997).
Caution: This action inevitably causes damage to any donor site. Also, transplanted soil could contain invasive plants, animals or microorganisms. A possible solution to these problems is to use soil from healthy marshes or swamps that are earmarked for destruction. Using local donor sites could minimize the spread of invasive species, and make use of communities adapted to local conditions.
Other published names for this action include “salvaged marsh surface replacement”, transplanting “seed banks” and “mulching”. We restrict the latter term to the addition of organic matter, such as domestic compost or seaweed, to the ground surface.
Related actions: Backfill canals or trenches; Introduce vegetation fragments without adding soil; Introduce seeds or propagules without adding soil; Transplant or replace blocks of vegetation.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of transplanting wetland soil to restore or create freshwater marshes. Nine studies were in the USA. One study was in Guam. Two studies were in the same region but used different sites.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies in rewetted marshes in the USA found that areas amended with wetland soil contained a plant community characteristic of wetter conditions than unamended plots after one growing season – but not after two. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a recently excavated marsh in the USA found that amended and unamended plots contained a plant community of similar overall wetness after both one and two growing seasons.
Overall richness/diversity (10 studies): Eight studies (including four at least replicated and controlled) in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that areas amended with wetland soil had greater plant richness and/or diversity than unamended areas and/or nearby natural marshes. One replicated, paired, controlled study in rewetted freshwater marshes in the USA found that plots amended with sieved marsh soil contained a similar number of wetland plant species to unamended plots, after 1–2 growing seasons. One before-and-after study of freshwater pool in Guam simply quantified plant species richness one year after adding wetland soil (along with other interventions).
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a freshwater marsh in the USA reported that plots amended with wetland soil developed a greater richness of wetland-characteristic plant species than unamended plots, at the end of the growing season.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (6 studies): Six controlled studies in freshwater marshes in the USA reported that plots amended with wetland soil typically contained more vegetation overall than unamended plots, after 1–2 growing seasons. This was true for cover and biomass, but not stem density.
Individual species abundance (7 studies): Seven studies (including one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, site comparison) in freshwater marshes, meadows and pools in the USA and Guam quantified the effect of this action (sometimes along with others) on the abundance of individual plant species. Results were mixed and likely depended on the composition of the donor wetland.

3274: Raise water level (before/after planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Drainage or water extraction, within or near to a focal wetland, can create conditions that are too dry to support healthy emergent vegetation. To complement planting efforts, the water level/table could be raised using techniques such as techniques such as: blocking drainage ditches; building raised embankments, berms or levees to retain water; switching off drainage pumps; installing or widening culverts under roads; ceasing groundwater extraction; removing dams upstream of the focal site; and reprofiling or diverting river channels.
The summarized evidence does not include general guidance about plant species’ moisture preferences, or laboratory studies of performance under different levels of soil moisture. To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have experimentally tested the effect of raising the water level to complement planting in the field.
Related actions: Raise water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Raise water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Irrigate before/after planting;     Actively manage water level after planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs);     Reprofile/relandscape before planting;     Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of raising the water level in areas planted with emergent marsh/swamp plants.

To complement planting efforts, the water level/table could be lowered by actions such as removing dams downstream, switching off water input pumps, and improving drainage by digging shallow “runnels” or deeper creeks (Wigand et al. 2017).
The summarized evidence does not include general guidance about plant species’ moisture preferences, or laboratory studies of performance under different levels of soil moisture. To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have experimentally tested the effect of raising the water level to complement planting in the field.
Related actions: Lower water level to restore degraded habitats (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Lower water level to restore/create habitats from other land uses (freshwater marshes – brackish/salt marshes – freshwater swamps – brackish/saline swamps);     Actively manage water level after planting (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs);     Reprofile/relandscape before planting.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves active, direct, continuous or repeated application of water to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. Irrigation could be done with systems such as sprinklers, channels or pipes. It can be used to manage moisture and salinity levels, creating suitable conditions for planted vegetation. Irrigation can be expensive so may be best used as a short-term intervention to kick-start restoration. It might also divert water resources away from marshes, swamps or other wetlands elsewhere.

Related actions: Actively manage water level, other than to complement planting; one-off interventions to Raise water level before/after planting; Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting; Irrigate before/after planting.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of actively managing water levels in freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. All three studies were in the USA. Two studies used the same experimental wet basins but planted different species.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One study in a freshwater marsh in the USA found that amongst plots amended with wetland soil, those flooded for longer contained fewer emergent plant species over the rest of the growing season following drawdown.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that amongst plots amended with wetland soil, those flooded for longer contained fewer wetland-characteristic plant species over the rest of the growing season following drawdown.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE 

Overall abundance (1 study): One study in a freshwater marsh in the USA found that amongst plots amended with wetland soil, those flooded for longer developed more submerged vegetation biomass before drawdown, but developed less emergent vegetation (biomass and stem density) over the rest of the growing season after drawdown.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two studies quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. For example, one controlled, before-and-after study in wet basins in the USA found that the effect of mimicking a natural (falling) water regime on lake sedge Carex lacustris biomass and density, in the three years after planting, depended on the year and various environmental factors (e.g. planting density, elevation and weeding of competitors).

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (2 studies): Two controlled studies in wet basins in the USA examined the effect of mimicking a natural (falling) water regime, compared to a stable or rising regime, on the height of sedges over three years after planting. One of the studies found no significant effect on the height of tussock sedge Carex stricta in three of three years. The other study found that the effect on the height of lake sedge Carex lacustris varied within and between years.

OTHER

Survival (2 studies): Two controlled studies in wet basins in the USA examined the effect of mimicking a natural (falling) water regime, compared to a stable or rising regime, on the survival of sedges Carex over three years after planting. The precise effect depended on the year and/or plot elevation. In the first year, sedge survival was typically lower under the falling regime.

3285: Reprofile/relandscape (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves large-scale reprofiling or landscaping of sites that are later planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. This includes excavating large basins (&gt;8 ha or 300 m diameter), moving soil/sediment from the site into levees/berms/impoundments, removing unnatural hills or levees, filling in deep depressions, and altering the elevation/slope of coastal areas. Generally, these interventions aim to restore wetland hydrology (how wet the soil is and when it is wet/flooded) by adjusting the ground surface relative to the water table or sea.
Caution: Landscaping often relies on heavy machinery, which can damage any existing vegetation, and churn or compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).
Related actions: Reprofile/relandscape, other than to complement planting; Raise water level before/after planting; Facilitate tidal exchange before/after planting; Create mounds or hollows before planting; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

3286: Create mounds or hollows before planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves creating discrete mounds (e.g. by adding blocks of soil, bundles of sticks, other coarse woody debris) or hollows (e.g. by excavation) before planting marsh or swamp vegetation. The scale of this action falls somewhere between reprofiling/relandscaping (large-scale landscape features, tens of metres wide) and disturbing the ground surface (which may create small scale mounds or hollows, millimetres or a few centimetres wide/deep).
Often, this action aims to mimic the natural microtopography of marshes or swamps, which can be created by sediment accumulation, erosion, tree fall, root growth or animal activity (Vivian-Smith 1997, Bruland & Richardson 2005). Microtopography can increase plant diversity, because the different microclimates or microelevations may support different species (Vivian-Smith 1997). Planting into mounds can be useful if seedlings would otherwise be flooded too deeply or for too long (Zamith & Scarano 2010). Large woody debris will also add nutrients and organic matter to a site as it decomposes.
Studies that examine the effects of planting into existing microtopographic features (e.g. mounds), even if they compare effects between different kinds of features, are not summarized as evidence here (e.g. Raulings et al. 2007; Sleeper & Ficklin 2016).

3290: Remove surface soil/sediment (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The surface soil/sediment – and any vegetation on it – could be removed from degraded wetlands, creating a new bare surface for planting vegetation. This new surface may have fewer nutrients and other pollutants, no undesirable seed bank, no hard crust and be wetter since the surface is now closer to the water table.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002). Soil removal can also have counter-intuitive effects, such as increasing ammonium concentrations because nitrifying bacteria, which break down ammonia, have been removed (Dorland 2004). Soil removal can be time consuming and expensive.
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment, other than to complement planting; Reprofile/relandscape before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting; Transplant wetland soil before/after planting.

3291: Bury surface soil/sediment (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The surface soil/sediment of degraded wetlands – and any vegetation on it – could be buried under deeper layers, for instance by deep ploughing. Burial can create bare soil/sediment with spaces for desirable plants to grow, prevent undesirable plants from growing from seeds already in the soil, remove excess nutrients that favour growth of undesirable weedy plants, and remove any contaminants or pollutants (Glen et al. 2017). Inverting, rather than removing, the upper soil layer maintains the ground level.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).

3292: Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment (and any vegetation on it), without permanently removing any soil/sediment. Mechanical disturbance could be carried out by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying. It may improve survival or growth of planted vegetation. It can clear potentially competing vegetation, and loosen up the soil to allow roots to penetrate more easily.
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting, including by deep ploughing.

3304: Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Inorganic fertilizer can provide nutrients that are in short supply, thereby increasing the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants. Commonly added nutrients include nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and/or potassium (K). Fertilizer is usually added immediately before or immediately after planting. It may be sensible to add fertilizer when the focal site is not flooded, to reduce the risk of it dissolving or being washed away.
The effects of this action may be heavily dependent on the study context, especially initial site nutrient levels, the amount of fertilizer added, and when it is added. Adding fertilizer when nutrients are already abundant in a site could cause more harm than good, encouraging the growth of undesirable plants or algae and even inhibiting plant growth (Weinbaum et al. 1992).

3308: Add below-ground organic matter before/after planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This section involves adding organic matter (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) below the ground surface (i.e. by mixing it into the sediment, or placing it into holes) to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation.
Organic matter could increase the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants, helping them to establish. Organic matter directly supplies nutrients to growing plants, supplies carbon and energy to soil organisms (which can indirectly increase nutrient availability), helps bind the soil together, retains water during dry periods, and mediates soil temperature (Donahue et al. 1983; Weil & Brady 2016). However, the soil organic matter content of wetland soils may be reduced by disturbance. For example, drainage allows oxygen into the soil, whilst reprofiling removes surface layers rich in organic matter (Bruland et al. 2006). Substances than can be used to add organic matter to wetland soils include compost, sewage sludge, wood chips and seaweed extract.
Note that many studies testing this action do not separate the effects of adding organic matter and disturbing the soil/sediment. We have included such studies, as well as those that do separate the effects of these actions with appropriate controls.
Related actions: Add below-ground organic matter, other than to complement planting; Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting; Add surface mulch to complement planting.

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated study of marshes alongside a stream in the USA found that adding compost before planting wetland herbs typically reduced overall plant species richness over the following three growing seasons. Richness was negatively related to the amount of soil organic matter in plots.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated study of marshes alongside a stream in the USA found that adding compost before planting wetland herbs had no significant effect on total vegetation biomass after three growing seasons. Biomass was not significantly related to the amount of soil organic matter in plots.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that adding sawdust to plots before sowing a mixture of target sedge meadow species had no significant effect on the density of target species overall or target grass-like species. Adding sawdust sometimes affected the density of target forbs, depending on the presence/diversity of a nurse crop.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled studies in wetlands in the USA quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. One study found that incorporating woodchips into soil mounds before planting tussock sedge Carex stricta reduced total tussock sedge cover after two growing seasons. The other study reported varying effects of sawdust addition on the abundance of individual plant species, depending on factors such as the species and presence/diversity of a nurse crop.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Individual plant size (4 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies (one also paired) in the USA found that mixing compost into the substrate before planting tussock sedge Carex stricta seedlings typically increased the biomass and/or number of shoots they developed over 2–3 months. However, in one of the studies, compost typically had no significant effect on top of other soil amendments. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that incorporating woodchips into soil mounds had no significant effect on the biomass of planted tussock sedge Carex stricta, over two growing seasons.

OTHER

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that seeds of mixed sedge meadow species had a similar germination rate, over 16 weeks after sowing, in plots with or without added sawdust.
Survival (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in an excavated wetland in the USA found that planted lurid sedge Carex lurida tubers had a higher survival rate, after one year, in plots that had been amended with leaf litter than in unamended plots. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that incorporating woodchips into soil mounds increased survival of planted tussock sedge Carex stricta in a drier area, but reduced its survival in a wetter area.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a wetland in the USA found that incorporating woodchips into soil mounds had no significant effect on the growth rate of planted tussock sedge Carex stricta, over two growing seasons.

3309: Add below-ground organic matter before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section involves adding organic matter (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) below the ground surface (i.e. by mixing it into the sediment, or placing it into holes) to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation.
Organic matter could increase the initial survival and/or growth rate of introduced plants, helping them to establish. Organic matter directly supplies nutrients to growing plants, supplies carbon and energy to soil organisms (which can indirectly increase nutrient availability), helps bind the soil together, retains water during dry periods, and mediates soil temperature (Donahue et al. 1983; Weil & Brady 2016). However, the soil organic matter content of wetland soils may be reduced by disturbance. For example, drainage allows oxygen into the soil, whilst reprofiling removes surface layers rich in organic matter (Bruland et al. 2006). Substances than can be used to add organic matter to wetland soils include compost, sewage sludge, wood chips and seaweed extract.
Note that many studies testing this action do not separate the effects of adding organic matter and disturbing the soil/sediment. We have included such studies, as well as those that do separate the effects of these actions with appropriate controls.
Related actions: Add below-ground organic matter, other than to complement planting; Add inorganic fertilizer before/after planting; Add surface mulch to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding below-ground organic matter to brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. Five studies were in the USA and one was in China. Two studies were in the same marsh, but used different experimental set-ups.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (5 studies): Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding organic matter before/after planting cordgrasses Spartina spp. typically had no significant effect on cordgrass abundance (biomass and/or density) after 1–2 growing seasons. One replicated, paired, controlled study in an estuary in the USA found that mixing kelp compost into the sediment before planting California cordgrass Spartina foliosa increased its density, three growing seasons later. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in an estuary in China found that mixing reed debris into the sediment before sowing seablite Suaeda salsa increased its biomass, but not its density, five months later.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Individual plant size (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuary in the USA found that tilling compost into plots before planting salt marsh vegetation typically increased the overall size of plants surviving after 1–2 growing seasons. Size was reported as a combination of height and lateral spread.
Height (5 studies): Four replicated, controlled studies in the USA and China found that adding organic matter before/after introducing salt marsh plants (cordgrasses Spartina spp. or seablite Suaeda salsa) had no significant effect on their height after 1–2 growing seasons. One replicated, paired, controlled study in an estuary in the USA found that mixing kelp compost into the sediment before planting California cordgrass Spartina foliosa increased its height, three growing seasons later.

OTHER

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an estuary in the USA found that plots amended with kelp compost supported a higher survival rate of planted salt marsh vegetation over 1–2 growing seasons, with a similar but typically insignificant trend for survival rates of individual species.
Growth (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that adding alginate after planting cordgrasses had no significant effect on the average number of shoots per plant, nine weeks later.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Organic mulches (i.e. remains or waste products of living organisms) can be placed on the surface of wetlands to stabilize temperatures and humidity, and provide shade to germinating plants. This may create a more hospitable environment for establishment and growth of planted vegetation. Examples of substances than can be used as mulches include compost, straw, seagrass leaves and seaweed (macroalgae).
Caution: It may be necessary to sterilize mulch before applying it, with heat or radiation, to kill propagules of undesirable plants. Adding organic matter as a mulch may be less labour intensive than mixing it into the soil or sediment, but increases the risk of the material being washed away.
Related actions: Add surface mulch, other than to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting.

3320: Transplant wetland soil before/after planting non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Loose soil can be transplanted from a healthy marsh or swamp to a one that is being created or restored. Soil could simply be added to a recipient site, or be used to replace material in the recipient site. Soil transplants can be useful to introduce a chemically and physically suitable substrate for growth of wetland vegetation, and a mixture of soil organisms such as bacteria, fungi and invertebrates (Anderson & Cowell 2004). Thus, soil transplants might be used to aid the initial survival and growth of introduced marsh or swamp plants. Soil transplants usually also contain a mixture of wetland plant seeds, roots, tubers or rhizomes, which could supplement the focal introduced vegetation to create a diverse, wetland-characteristic plant community.
Caution: This action inevitably causes damage to any donor site. Also, transplanted soil could contain invasive plants, animals or microorganisms. A possible solution to these problems is to use soil from healthy marshes or swamps that are earmarked for destruction. Using local donor sites could minimize the spread of invasive species, and make use of communities adapted to local conditions.
Other published names for this action include “salvaged marsh surface replacement”, transplanting “seed banks” and “mulching”. We restrict the latter term to the addition of organic matter that is largely free of plant propagules, e.g. domestic compost or seaweed, to the ground surface.

3323: Transplant wetland soil before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Loose soil can be transplanted from a healthy marsh or swamp to a one that is being created or restored. Soil could simply be added to a recipient site, or be used to replace material in the recipient site. Soil transplants can be useful to introduce a chemically and physically suitable substrate for growth of wetland vegetation, and a mixture of soil organisms such as bacteria, fungi and invertebrates (Anderson & Cowell 2004). Thus, soil transplants might be used to aid the initial survival and growth of introduced marsh or swamp plants. Soil transplants usually also contain a mixture of wetland plant seeds, roots, tubers or rhizomes, which could supplement the focal introduced vegetation to create a diverse, wetland-characteristic plant community.
Caution: This action inevitably causes damage to any donor site. Also, transplanted soil could contain invasive plants, animals or microorganisms. A possible solution to these problems is to use soil from healthy marshes or swamps that are earmarked for destruction. Using local donor sites could minimize the spread of invasive species, and make use of communities adapted to local conditions.
Other published names for this action include “salvaged marsh surface replacement”, transplanting “seed banks” and “mulching”. We restrict the latter term to the addition of organic matter that is largely free of plant propagules, e.g. domestic compost or seaweed, to the ground surface.

3324: Introduce nurse plants to aid focal non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Nurse plants, also known as companion plants or pioneer plants, can be planted alongside focal plants to help the focal plants establish (Padilla & Pugnaire 2006). Nurse plants may benefit focal plants in variety of ways, including: trapping and stabilizing sediments, trapping propagules, mitigating harsh environmental conditions (e.g. temperature fluctuations and strong sunlight), attracting pollinators, deflecting herbivory away from focal species, and/or limiting weed establishment.
Caution: Nurse plant species must be chosen carefully. Species that spread easily or are very strong competitors can cause more harm than good. For example, the non-native mangrove apple Sonneratia apetala has been used to restore Chinese mangroves, but has spread into neighbouring forests (Ren et al. 2009). Use of non-native nurse plants may not always be ethically acceptable.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have (a) deliberately introduced nurse plants before planting target marsh or swamp vegetation, and (b) reported the effects of the nurse plants on other vegetation, not just the survival or growth of the nurse plants. Studies must have explicitly planted vegetation for its nursing effect. Studies are not summarized as evidence here if they planted target vegetation into existing nurse vegetation (e.g. Egerova et al. 2003; McKee et al. 2007), or examined spontaneous colonization amongst planted nurse vegetation.
Related actions: Introduce nurse plants without introducing target marsh or swamp vegetation.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that sowing potential nurse plants alongside target sedge meadow species reduced the density of the target species overall, and of target grass-like species. Nurse plant addition sometimes affected the abundance of target forbs, depending on the presence of an invasive species and addition of sawdust to plots.
Individual species abundance (2 studies): Two replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after studies in wet basins in the USA quantified the effect of this action on the abundance of individual plant species. One study reported that sowing potential nurse plants typically had no significant effect on – and sometimes reduced – the biomass of sown porcupine sedge Carex hystericina, after 1–2 growing seasons. The other study reported varying effects of potential nurse plants on the abundance of individual target plant species, depending on factors such as diversity of the nurse crop and addition of sawdust to plots.

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in an experimental wet basin in the USA found that the presence of a high-diversity nurse crop reduced the germination rate of sown sedge meadow species.

3328: Use fences or barriers to protect freshwater wetlands planted with non-woody plants
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Plants introduced to wetlands may be vulnerable to physical damage from grazing, wind, waves or sediment. Barriers could be used to protect planted vegetation from such physical damage. Here, “barriers” is used quite broadly and includes sleeves, tree guards, fences and fine-meshed silt screens placed around planted vegetation, sticky oils or resins painted onto planted vegetation, and offshore walls or breakwaters. Some of these barriers may have incidental effects on temperature, humidity and sunlight intensity (but covers and screens whose main aim is to modify these factors are considered elsewhere). If the general area containing planted vegetation is fenced, rather than individual planted plants, other colonizing vegetation may benefit too.
Related actions: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed marshes; Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed marshes; Exclude wild vertebrates using physical barriers; Exclude wild invertebrates using physical barriers; Add surface mulch to complement planting; Add cover other than mulch to complement planting.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of using fences or barriers to protect freshwater wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants. There was one study in each of Canada, the Netherlands, Israel and the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that amongst planted/sown lakeshores, those protected with fences or wave breaks contained different wetland plant communities, after 1–6 years, than those without fences or wave breaks.

To be clear, this action includes various specific actions that remove undesirable plants (e.g. physical removal, mowing, herbicide application) or kill undesirable seeds (e.g. burning, covering the soil with black plastic) in areas planted with desirable marsh or swamp plants. Management might be one-off or continuous. Evidence summarized for this action focuses on responses of the planted vegetation; studies that report responses of other vegetation are included in separate interventions elsewhere on this site.
Related actions: Introduce nurse plants before/after planting target marsh or swamp vegetation.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on trees/shrubs planted in brackish/saline wetlands, of removing competing plants.

3340: Use flotation devices to support planted vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marsh and swamp plant species have varying tolerances to flooding (Banach et al. 2009). Plants could be introduced with flotation devices, to ensure they are not flooded too deeply during early growth but remain in contact with the ground when water levels are lower. For example, plants might be introduced within peat bags and/or with attached pool noodles (Dreschel et al. 2017). It will probably be necessary to tether the plants or flotation devices to hold them in place. Caution: It may be difficult to remove materials (e.g. plastics) used to construct flotation devices, leading to pollution of the conservation site (Dreschel et al. 2017).
We captured no direct quantitative comparisons of plant performance with and without successfully operating flotation devices. Dreschel et al. (2017) reported high survival rates and similar growth rates of saplings planted in peat bags with and without pool noodles, but did not clearly describe the effect of adding pool noodles (peat bags floated anyway) or include saplings planted directly into the marsh.

3350: Add root-associated fungi to plants before planting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many marsh and swamp plants form mutually beneficial associations with fungi (Cooke & Lefor 1998). These ‘mycorrhizal’ fungi live in or around plant roots. They can increase plant access to nutrients and minimize the effect of stresses such as drought and pollution (Finlay 2008). Adding mycorrhizal fungi vegetation before it is introduced could therefore help survival and growth. Fungi could be added via a root dip, or by adding spores to the surrounding soil.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated plants. Studies that simply report the performance of treated plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.
Related interventions: Apply root dip to plants before planting, including all non-fungal treatments (freshwater non-woody – brackish/saline non-woody – freshwater trees/shrubs – brackish/saline trees/shrubs).

An abundance of roots might help the planted vegetation to take up enough water during dry periods. Adventitious roots may grow from the stem, near the water line, and help with oxygen uptake if the site is flooded or saturated (Havens 1996). Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of soaked and unsoaked plants. Studies that simply report the performance of pruned plants are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.

3379: Physically damage tree/shrub seeds before sowing: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Damaging, weakening or softening the coating of seeds before planting can help to break seed dormancy and encourage germination. For species with physical dormancy, damage to the seed coat can increase its permeability to water and gases, which are essential for germination. For a database of seed dormancy class by species, see Baskin & Baskin (2014).
This action includes mechanically damaging seeds (e.g. by rubbing them with sandpaper or nicking them with a knife) and removing excess tissues from around the seed (e.g. the sac-like perigynia around sedge seeds). To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species.
Related actions: Soak seeds before sowing; Chill seeds before sowing; Heat seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.

Germination/emergence (6 studies): Of six replicated, controlled studies in greenhouses or laboratories in the USA, five identified chemicals that sometimes increased, and did not significantly reduce, the germination rate of herb seeds: potassium nitrate, nitric acid and bleach. The effect of these chemicals depended on factors such as the age of the seeds, the species and other pre-sowing treatments. Two of the studies identified chemicals that never had a significant effect on the germination rate of herb seeds: a plant hormone and sulfuric acid.

Title: Marsh and Swamp Conservation

3384: Designate protected area
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action includes protection of specific marshes or swamps, or areas that contain these habitats, whether through legal means (e.g. many National Parks and Marine Protected Areas) or some other agreement or commitment (e.g. Biosphere Reserves, Ramsar Sites, Wild and Scenic Rivers). Protected areas may be publicly or privately owned.
Protected areas may prohibit all human uses, or allow sustainable use to varying degrees and perhaps within designated zones. ‘Wise use’ of wetlands – allowing activities such as collection of plant materials for handicrafts, fishing, hunting, charcoal production and scientific research, as long as the ecological character of the site is maintained – is a fundamental principle of the Ramsar Convention (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2010).
Studies that include, or aim to conserve, at least some marsh or swamp habitat are summarized as evidence for this action. Given the broad scale of this action, results may include other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands and mudflats), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests). It is not unusual for an entire catchment or watershed to be protected (Sullivan et al. 2018).
We have not summarized the following types of information, which are particularly weak or misleading when assessing effectiveness of protected areas:

Information about implementation only (i.e. area or number of protected sites).
Studies comparing protected and unprotected areas at a single time point (e.g. Imbert & Delbé 2006; Di Bella et al. 2014). In such studies, differences between protected and unprotected areas may simply reflect the fact that “better” areas (e.g. containing more species or marsh/swamp habitat) were selected for protection (Joppa & Pfaff 2009).
Studies examining the effects of specific interventions designed to tackle threats within protected areas (e.g. hunting, vehicle use, overharvesting). These studies are considered in other chapters.

Caution: Restricting certain activities in protected areas could actually increase the threat they pose. For example, restricting prescribed burning might (a) cause a build-up of vegetation or litter, stockpiling fuel for wild fires, or (b) encourage more illicit and uncontrolled burning due to the hurdle of obtaining permits (Pott & Pott 2004).

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the overall effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of designating protected areas involving marshes or swamps. There were two studies in China, one in Malaysia and one in Puerto Rico.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (4 studies): Two studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in China reported that the area of marsh, swamp or unspecified wetland in protected areas declined over 6–12 years. One replicated, site comparison study in Puerto Rico reported that protection had no clear effect on mangrove forest area, with similar changes over 25 years in protected and unprotected sites. One study of a mangrove forest in Malaysia reported that it retained at least 97% of its forest area over 98 years of protection as a forest reserve.

3385: Provide general protection for marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This action involves general protection of marshes or swamps by hard law, policy or regulation, usually at a national or international level. Conceptually, this is similar to protecting individual species, such as in the European Union Habitats Directive. In 1760, King Don José of Portugal issued an order to restrict the widespread cutting of mangroves in Brazil (FAO 2007). More recently, the Sri Lankan Environment Ministry agreed to establish legal protection for all of the country’s mangroves (Seacology 2016).
Studies that include, or aim to conserve, at least some marsh or swamp habitat are summarized as evidence for this action. Given the broad scale of this action, results may include other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands and mudflats), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).

However, in China, the decline was slower than in a previous period without protection. One before-and-after study of mangrove forests in Puerto Rico reported that their area increased following legal protection.

3386: Require mitigation of impacts to marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Authorities may require mitigation of impacts to the environment (State of Queensland 2017) or wetlands specifically (Gardner et al. 2012; Poulin et al. 2016). For example, under the Section 404 of the Clean Water Act in the USA, a permit is required for discharging sediment into wetlands. Where possible, impacts should be avoided or minimized. Any unavoidable impacts must be compensated for (or offset) by protection, restoration or creation of wetlands elsewhere. Mitigation legislation is intended to protect the overall quantity and quality of wetlands in a region or country.
Given that mitigation requiriements typically have broad coverage, results may include other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands and mudflats), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests). Studies that include, or aim to conserve, at least some marsh or swamp habitat are summarized as evidence for this action. Where possible, specific results for marshes and swamps have been extracted.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have looked at the impact of permits on the number/area/type of wetlands created or restored in practice. Studies only looking at permits issued and mitigation required by permits are not included as evidence (although this information may be included as context for the summarized studies). Results relating to detailed characteristics of vegetation within restored/created mitigation wetlands (e.g. Balcombe et al. 2005) are summarized elsewhere on this site.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the overall effects – on vegetation or human behaviour – of requiring mitigation of impacts to marshes or swamps. All nine studies were in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (6 studies): Four studies in the USA reported that requiring mitigation of impacts to wetlands did not prevent loss of wetland area: the total area restored/created was less than the area destroyed. One study in the USA reported that the total area of wetlands restored/created for mitigation was greater than the area destroyed. However, the area restored/created was smaller in most individual projects. Two of the studies reported that fewer individual wetlands were restored/created than destroyed. One before-and-after study in the USA found that wetland area declined after legislation to offset impacts came into force, but at a slower rate than before the legislation applied. Four of the studies reported discrepancies between the area of specific vegetation types restored/created vs destroyed.

Compliance (8 studies): Eight studies, all in the USA, provided information about compliance with required mitigation. Five of the studies reported that the total area of wetlands conserved was less than the area required in permits. Three of the studies reported that most mitigation projects failed to meet targets stipulated in permits. One of the studies reported that only one of seven vegetation targets was met in all mitigation sites. One of the studies reported that 64–74% of assessed mitigation areas met success criteria stipulated in permits.

3387: Pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Stakeholders could be paid to conserve marshes or swamps and the benefits they provide (e.g. wildlife habitat and carbon storage). This may involve protection of individual extant sites, or restoration/creation of sites to protect large-scale extent of marsh and swamp habitats. Participation is typically voluntary. Payments could be made directly or as tax incentives, could be paid as cash or as alternative lands, and could come from governments, non-governmental organizations or private sponsorship. Advice, monitoring and enforcement are often offered alongside payments.
Examples of payment schemes relevant to marsh and swamp conservation include the Wetland Reserve Programme in the USA (NRCS 2019), nationally or internationally funded agri-environment schemes (Keenleyside & Moxey 2011), and the Bio-Rights programme in which funding for community development is contingent on the community carrying out agreed conservation actions (van Eijk & Kumar 2009).
Studies that include, or aim to conserve, at least some marsh or swamp habitat are summarized as evidence for this action. Given the broad scale of this action, results may include other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands and mudflats), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests). Studies must quantify the overall effects of paying stakeholders, with some comparison of conservation activities with vs without payment (e.g. in management units enrolled on payment schemes vs not, states with payment schemes vs without, or times before vs after introduction of payment schemes). The following types of study have not been summarized as evidence of this action:

Studies simply examining vegetation within wetlands restored/created under payment schemes (e.g. De Steven & Gramling 2012).
Studies reporting uptake only (e.g. area of land contracted to payment schemes, or number of people signed up).
Studies examining effects of specific interventions carried out under payment schemes (e.g. abandoning land, rewetting, planting, or multiple interventions). These are included in other chapters.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves educating the public about the importance of marshes and swamps, the threats they face and what can be done to protect them (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands 2018). Messages could be conveyed through information boards, talks, art projects, adverts, leaflets, celebrity endorsements, blogs, news articles, social media and videos (e.g. www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3GXlESxaR4). The aim is to change public attitudes and behaviour to benefit marshes and swamps: anything from encouraging people to use less water, to use environmentally-friendly cleaning products, to lobby governments to better protect marshes and swamps, or to take direct action to conserve these habitats. Note that the effects of these specific actions are considered elsewhere in the synopsis.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the awareness raising is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).

Local people may be engaged in a range of marsh and swamp conservation projects, from designing management plans, to carrying out practical management and even monitoring as citizen scientists. Local people may be fundamentally integrated into management (“community-based conservation”) or participate occasionally. They may be volunteers or employees. Projects that actively engage local people could increase awareness of marshes and swamps and their value, increase awareness of rules and regulations, change perceptions, and create a sense of ownership (Danielsen et al. 2003; Evely et al. 2011; Mombo et al. 2013). Local knowledge may also enhance the success of conservation actions.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the management or monitoring is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).

3391: Provide education/training programmes about marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves education programmes, training courses or workshops, aimed at people who directly use, manage or influence marshes and swamps (e.g. managers, farmers in the catchment, local people). Education or training may be about these habitats in general (e.g. their wildlife, their value to humans) or about management techniques (including sustainable water use and land use practices). It may aim to increase the income of local people using marshes or swamps, in order to sustain their livelihoods without intensification or expansion of environmentally damaging activities (but consider that higher incomes could also encourage expansion of activities, as in farmed dambos in Malawi/Zambia; Wetlands International 2009). Education or training may be specifically about vegetation, or about broader aspects of marsh or swamp habitats.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the education or training programmes are substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if they involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).
Related actions: Designate protected area involving marshes or swamps, which may be supported by education or training; Pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps, which may involve education or training; Raise public awareness about marshes or swamps, other than with formal education or training.

3392: Produce guidance for marsh or swamp conservation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Producing guidance, manuals or evidence syntheses to improve the effectiveness of marsh or swamp conservation is, in itself, a conservation action! Effectiveness could be considered in terms of changing the behaviour of practitioners (Is the guidance consulted? Do practitioners change their behaviour when presented with guidance?) and, ideally, in terms of impacts on marsh or swamp vegetation (Are projects that use guidance more effective than those that do not?).
Guidance may be based on personal knowledge or experience, or be a more formal synthesis of published evidence (e.g. the synopses produced by Conservation Evidence, systematic reviews or meta-analyses). However, to be considered as evidence for this action, the guidance must have been written or used for the conservation of marsh or swamp vegetation.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the guidance is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).

Key Messages:

3393: Use marketing strategies to increase the value of marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action includes various specific actions that could increase the value of marshes/swamp or their products through marketing, advertising, branding or certification schemes. For example, in Kenya, certification of Nyando Wetland honey by the Kenya Bureau of Standards added credibility to the brand and increased demand (Raburu et al. 2012). In theory, this action could strengthen economic arguments to protect marshes and swamps. Increasing the value of products could also reduce the amount of habitat that must be used to provide a sustainable income, or even encourage creation of new habitat areas. Creating an emblem or brand for a marsh or swamp could directly generate income through licensing (e.g. for use on clothing), and indirectly increase the value of the site for tourism (van der Duim & Henkens 2007; Chellan et al. 2013).
Caution: Marketing could also have negative effects on marshes and swamps. For example, if marsh or swamp products become more valuable, there may be greater incentive for people to harvest or exploit these habitats.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the marketing is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).
Related actions: Designate protected area, including areas that allow sustainable use of marshes or swamps.

3394: Lobby/campaign/demonstrate to protect marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Lobbying or peaceful demonstrations could put pressure on projects that threaten marshes or swamps, preventing them from occurring or minimizing their impact. Specific actions include demonstrating on site, writing letters and social media campaigns.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must involve campaigns targeted at organizations such as businesses or governments. Studies must provide some detail about what the lobbying, campaigning or demonstrating involved in practice. For example, Wetlands International (2014) report that their “advocacy influence” has led to the alteration or abandonment of several projects that could have impacted marshes or swamps (e.g. delay and redesign of the Fomi Dam, Upper Niger River, and consideration of marsh ecosystems in Shell’s oil and gas operations in Iraq). We have not summarized these examples as evidence because there is little detail about the methods used in their advocacy.
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the lobbying is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).
Related actions: Raise public awareness about marshes or swamps.

3395: Classify conservation status of individual sites
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Classifying the conservation status of individual marshes or swamps, or the level of threat that they face, may help to prioritize sites in need of the most urgent intervention – or avoid wasting resources on sites that are unlikely to be saved by intervention. Lists of the most threatened or degraded sites may also help in arguments to secure funding for conservation. The Montreux Record, for example, is a register of internationally important wetlands where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2013).
To be clear, studies would be summarized as evidence for this action if the classification is substantially related to marshes and swamps, even if it involves other wetland habitats (e.g. peatlands), aquatic habitats (e.g. rivers and lakes) or upland habitats (e.g. forests).
Related actions: Designate protected area involving marshes or swamps; Provide general protection for marshes or swamps.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation or human behaviour, of classifying the conservation status of individual marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
