2055: Set limits for change in sediment particle size during rock dumping
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Rock dump involves placing rock material on the seabed or surrounding infrastructure to stabilise underwater structures from offshore industries, such as oil and gas platforms or windfarms, to protect pipelines, and remove the risk of snagging by fishing vessels operating trawl nets (Visser & van der Meer 2008). Rock dump can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through loss of natural sediment and changes in habitat characteristics, such as particle size. Setting limits for changes in particle size during rock dump may reduce the level of threat and retain suitable sediment and habitat properties, thereby potentially reducing risk to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Evidence related to other means of stabilizing or burying offshore infrastructures and pipelines are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Bury pipelines instead of surface laying and rock dumping” and “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Bury cables and pipelines in the seabed rather than laying them on the seabed”. Other evidence for interventions related to rock dumping are summarised in “Habitat restoration and creation – Modify rock dump to make it more similar to natural substrate”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Rock dump involves placing rock material on the seabed or surrounding infrastructure to stabilise underwater structures from offshore industries, such as oil and gas platforms or windfarms, to protect pipelines, and remove the risk of snagging by fishing vessels operating trawl nets (Visser & van der Meer 2008). Rock dump can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through loss of natural sediment and changes in habitat characteristics, such as particle size. Burying pipelines removes the need for dumping rock over them as a protection means, therefore potentially reducing the level of associated threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates (De Groot 1982 ; Morrow & Larking 2007). Evidence for other interventions related to rock dumping are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Use stabilisation material that can be more easily recovered at decommissioning stage” and “Limit the amount of stabilisation material used”. Evidence for other interventions related to pipelines and subsea cables are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Cover subsea cables with artificial reefs” and “Cover subsea cables with materials that encourage the accumulation of natural sediments”.

2057: Limit the amount of stabilisation material used
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Stabilisation material, such as concrete mattresses and rocks (rock dump), can be used to keep pipelines and infrastructure (from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining or aggregate extraction) in place and may also help to protect the infrastructure (for instance from fishing gears) by covering them. This process and material can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbances, loss of natural sediment, and changes in habitat characteristics. Limiting the amount of stabilisation material used can reduce the threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates by reducing the amount of physical damage and habitat loss. Evidence for other interventions related to the use of stabilisation material are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Use stabilisation material that can be more easily recovered at decommissioning stage”.

Stabilisation material, such as concrete mattresses and rocks (rock dump), can be used to keep pipelines and infrastructure (from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining or aggregate extraction) in place and may also help to protect the infrastructure (for instance from fishing gears) by covering them. Stabilisation material may need to be recovered following decommissioning, and their retrieval might cause additional physical disturbances to the seabed and to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Stabilisation materials designed to be easily recovered at the decommissioning stage can help reduce the level of habitat disturbance associated with this process. Evidence for interventions related to the decommissioning of offshore infrastructures and pipelines are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Remove pipelines and infrastructure following decommissioning” and “Leave pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning”.

Background information and definitions:
Pipelines and infrastructure from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and loss of habitat when the infrastructure is constructed, but also when they are removed following decommissioning. Leaving structures in place may involve the least environmental and physical disturbances (Brigitte et al. 2018; Chandler et al. 2017). In addition, it could potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates by providing habitat and shelter (Ponti et al. 2002; see also related interventions: “Habitat restoration and creation – Repurpose obsolete offshore structures to act as artificial reefs”, “Cover subsea cables with artificial reefs”, and “Cover subsea cables with materials that encourage the accumulation of natural sediments”).

Pipelines and infrastructure from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and loss of habitat when the infrastructure is constructed, but also following decommissioning through indirect environmental impacts, such as chemical leaching and corrosion of structures (Picken et al. 1997). Removing structures is one decommissioning option to remove the threat from the marine environment (Brigitte et al. 2018; Chandler et al. 2017). In the OSPAR maritime area for instance, the at-sea disposal or leaving in place of disused offshore installations is prohibited (OSPAR 1998).

2061: Cease or prohibit oil and gas drilling
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Routine oil and gas drilling activities can impact subtidal invertebrate seabed communities due to smothering and burial from drill cuttings and drill fluids, , pollution from the use of chemicals and additives, physical damage or loss of suitable natural sediment (Cordes et al. 2016). Ceasing on-going oil and gas drilling, for instance following protective legislation or the non-renewal of permit, can stop the threat and potentially allow for the community to recover over time.
However, it should be kept in mind that prohibition in one place may simply lead to displacement, which may impact the same or different communities in other locations.

2062: Cease or prohibit the deposit of drill cuttings on the seabed
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Routine oil and gas drilling activities can impact subtidal invertebrate seabed communities due to the production of drill cuttings. Drill cuttings consist of the fragments of rock that are removed as each oil or gas well is drilled. The drill cuttings are usually discharged onto the seafloor in the vicinity of the platforms to form a cuttings pile, but are often contaminated with drilling fluids, oil and chemical additives which can leach and pollute the sediments. Drill cuttings can also smother and bury organisms under their weight (Henry et al. 2017). Ceasing the deposit of drill cuttings, for instance following protective legislation or changes in activity management, can stop the threat and potentially allow for the community to recover over time. Evidence related to alternative means of disposing of drill cuttings are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining - Dispose of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed” and “Bury drill cuttings in the seabed rather than leaving them on the seabed surface”.

Background information and definitions:
'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes. Aggregate extraction can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical removal, loss and alteration of seabed and habitat, and direct physical damage from the machinery used (De Groot 1996). Aggregate extraction could be ceased (for instance following end of licence or voluntary cessation of activities) or prohibited (through legislation) in an area, and the site and its invertebrates left to naturally recover over time (Desprez 2000). Evidence for other interventions related to aggregate extraction is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Mining and quarrying”, and in “Habitat restoration and creation – Refill disused borrow pits” and “Landscape or artificially enhance the seabed”.

The other site comparison found that species richness did not change over time and remained different to that of natural sites. One replicated, site comparison study in the North Sea found that 21 months after ceasing aggregate extractiom, invertebrate species richness was similar to that of natural sites.
Worm community composition (1 study): One before-and-after study in the North Sea found that after ceasing aggregate extraction, nematode worm community composition remained different to the pre-extraction community.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes. Aggregate extraction can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical removal, loss and alteration of seabed and habitat, and direct physical damage from the machinery used (De Groot 1996). Two methods are commonly practised: anchor suction hopper dredging, a static type of extraction (De Groot 1996), and trailer suction hopper dredging which takes place from a moving vessel (Birchenough et al. 2010; Boyd & Rees 2003). In some areas, such as in the UK, both methods are used (Boyd & Rees 2003). Although both methods cause severe disturbance in seabed invertebrate communities (Desprez 2000, Sardá et al. 2000), the differences between dredged and surrounding undredged areas are more significant after static dredging (Boyd & Rees 2003). Trailer dredging is thought to reduce the intensity, and therefore the impact, of dredging in any one area by leaving small pockets of areas unaffected and from which recolonization and recovery may occur (Szymelfenig et al. 2006). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Mining and quarrying”.

2072: Set limits for change in sediment particle size during aggregate extraction
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes. During aggregate extraction, the unwanted part of the sediment is discarded back into the water or onto the seabed. Consequently, changes occur to the size of sediment particles, which can alter the natural seabed and the invertebrates living on or inside it (De Groot 1996). Limits for acceptable change in particle size during aggregate extraction can be set, with the aim of reducing the amount of alteration to seabed sediment properties. This may facilitate recovery following cessation of activities post-extraction (Cooper 2013). Additional evidence for intervention related to sediment discard during aggregate extraction and other activities are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Limit, cease, or prohibit sediment discard during aggregate extraction”, “Remove discarded sediment material from the seabed following cessation of aggregate extraction”, and “Set limits for change in sediment particle size during rock dump”.

During aggregate extraction, the unwanted part of the sediment is discarded back into the water or onto the seabed. Consequently, changes occur to the size of sediment particles, which can alter the natural seabed and the invertebrates living on or inside it, but additionally this discarded sediment portion can also directly physically impact invertebrates, for instance through smothering (De Groot 1996). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discard of sediment during aggregate extraction can potentially reduce the amount of alteration to seabed sediment properties, and also avoid smothering of invertebrates. This may facilitate recovery following cessation of activities post-extraction (Cooper 2013). Additional evidence for intervention related to sediment discard during aggregate extraction and other activities are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Remove discarded sediment material from the seabed following cessation of aggregate extraction”, and “Set limits for change in sediment particle size during rock dump”.

2074: Remove discarded sediment material from the seabed following cessation of aggregate extraction
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes (De Groot 1996). During extraction, a portion of sediment is often discarded, being unwanted or in excess depending on the industry requirements, and left on the seabed, changing its characteristics and further impacting invertebrates through habitat modifications. Following the cessation of aggregate extraction, this discarded material could be removed from the seabed through additional dredging (Cooper 2013), thereby removing the threat and potentially allowing natural recovery (Cooper et al. 2011). Additional evidence for intervention related to sediment discard during aggregate extraction and other activities are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Limit, cease, or prohibit sediment discard during aggregate extraction”, and “Set limits for change in sediment particle size during rock dump”.

2075: Cease or prohibit marine mining
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine mining involves the retrieval of minerals from the seabed, usually through dredging. While certain minerals mostly occur in the deep sea, where mining is yet to be undertaken at an industrial scale, offshore and coastal mining does occur in parts of the world (Miller et al. 2018). Mining can have negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbances from dredging operations, chemical contamination, and changes in sediment characteristics (Jewett et al. 1999). Mining could be ceased (for instance following end of licence or voluntary cessation of activities) or prohibited (through legislation) in an area, and the site and its invertebrates left to naturally recover over time (Jewett et al. 1999).

2076: Cease or prohibit mining waste (tailings) disposal at sea
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mine tailings (the ore waste of mines typically in the form of a mud-like material) originate from both coastal and land-based mining activities and can be disposed of in the marine environment. These mine tailings disposals are known as “submarine tailing disposal” in shallow waters, and “deep sea tailings disposal” in deeper waters (Vare et al. 2018). Mine tailings can have negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbances, smothering, chemical contamination (Marinho et al. 2017), and changes in sediment characteristics (Kathman et al. 1983) and submarine tailing disposal has been prohibited in parts of the world (Kline & Stekoll 2001). Ceasing or prohibiting submarine mine tailings disposal in an area can remove the source of harm and potentially allow natural recovery of the seabed and its invertebrate community. Evidence for interventions related to marine mining are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Cease or prohibit marine mining” and “Leave mine tailings in place following cessation of activities”.

2078: Limit the number and/or extent of, or prohibit additional, renewable energy installations in an area
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Renewable energy installations, such as marine wind farms, are becoming widespread in the marine environment (Boehlert & Gill 2010). However, their occurrence can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through direct physical damage when the infrastructure is constructed, changes in hydrology, and loss of habitat (from sedimentary grounds to hard surfaces) (Langhamer 2012). The number of renewable energy installations, or their spatial extent (area of seabed covered), could be limited in one area, for instance through the development of marine protected areas, bylaws, or other legislation. Doing so could limit the area impacted by renewable energy installations and the intensity of the pressure, thereby limiting the negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates. Evidence for intervention related to marine spatial planning and co-location of activities are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Co-locate aquaculture systems with other activities and other infrastructures (such as wind farms) to maximise use of marine space”.

2079: Co-locate aquaculture systems with other activities and other infrastructures (such as wind farms) to maximise use of marine space
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through damages to the seabed, pollution, or spread of non-native species (Wu et al. 1994). Some of these threats are also commonly associated with other anthropogenic activities or infrastructures, such as oil rigs and wind farms (Gimpel et al. 2015; Inger et al. 2009). By co-locating aquaculture systems with these activities and infrastructure, the cumulative negative impacts can be spatially limited and constrained in extent, therefore potentially preventing their occurrence elsewhere, or allowing recovery in the case of relocation. Marine spatial planning can help with identifying suitable area for the occurrence of multiple complex activities (Douvere 2008; Inger et al. 2009). Evidence for interventions related to aquaculture relocation are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate aquaculture systems in already impacted areas”, “Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to act as biofilters”, and “Habitat restoration and creation – Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient run-offs”.

The burial process could be planned ahead of installation, or at a later stage following the lay-out of the cable or pipeline, with the aim of reducing physical impacts on the seabed and on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Kraus & Carter 2018). This may allow natural sediment to cover the cables or pipelines, thereby recreating a suitable habitat, and potentially allowing recolonization by subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2086: Cease or prohibit shipping
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shipping (here meaning the movement of any commercial vessels, including cargo ships but also fishing ships) can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical disturbance, introduction of non-native species and pollution. When shipping is undertaken for fishing, it can also lead to additional pressure from the fishing activities. Shipping can be stopped or prohibited in specific areas. For instance, buffer zones around windfarm structures or gas platforms are usually set and exclude any ship from entering (Coates et al. 2016). In these instances, shipping closures also act as fisheries closures. These exclusion zones can either be temporary, such as during the windfarm construction (Roach et al. 2018), or permanent (Bergman et al. 2015). Ceasing shipping activities can potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates by reducing and/or removing this pressure, allowing them to potentially recover over time. A direct consequence of ceasing shipping is the cessation of fishing, and in particular bottom trawling, for which evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological Resource Use – Cease or prohibit bottom trawling”.  Evidence for related interventions are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all types of fishing” and “Establish temporary fisheries closure”, as well as under “Habitat restoration and creation – Place anthropogenic installations (e.g. windfarms) in an area to act as artificial reefs and reduce the level of fishing”.

Recreational boating, including powerboats, sailboats, or man-powered vessels such as rowing and paddle boats, can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage from anchors and propellers (Lloret et al. 2008; Milazzo et al. 2002; Whitfield et al. 2002), disturbance from fast flowing water or suspension of sediments, or pollution (Hammerstrom et al. 2007). Recreational boating could be limited in one area, by restricting the activity in space and time (limits on duration and occurrence, delimiting allowed areas). Boating could also be ceased by setting a permanent or temporary closure (e.g. seasonal closure), or prohibited through bylaws. This may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with these activities and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time. When restrictions of recreational boating occur in the context of a marine protected area, evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection”, including “Habitat protection - Designate a Marine Protected Area and set a no-anchoring zone”.

Description: 
2089: Limit, cease or prohibit anchoring from ships/boats/vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anchors are designed to dig into or hook onto the seabed to secure a vessel’s position and prevent it from drifting with the winds or currents. Anchoring of recreational and/or commercial vessels can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, disturbance to and penetration into the seabed from anchors and chains (Griffith et al. 2017; Lloret et al. 2008; Whitfield et al. 2002). Structurally complex seabed habitats, such as seagrass and mussel beds, or oyster and coral reels, are considered particularly at risks from recreational anchoring (Hammerstrom et al. 2007). The areas where vessels (commercial or recreational) are allowed to anchor could be limited or ceased, for instance by restricting the activity in space and time (limits on duration and occurrence) or restricting the number of anchors allowed at any one time. Anchoring could also be ceased by setting a permanent or temporary closure (e.g. seasonal closure), or prohibited through bylaws and the creation of no-anchoring zones (Griffith et al. 2017). This may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with anchoring and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time.
       For evidence related to recreational anchoring within a marine protected area, see “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and set a no-anchoring zone”. Evidence for other interventions related to anchoring is summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Use a different type of anchor” and “Provide additional moorings to reduce anchoring”.

Background information and definitions:
Anchors are designed to dig into or hook onto the seabed to secure a vessel’s position and prevent it from drifting with the winds or currents. Anchoring can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, disturbance to and penetration in the seabed (Griffiths et al. 2017). Because anchor size, weight and design affect the level of impact caused (Liley et al. 2012), a different type of anchors, such as sacrificial anchors, could be used to reduce the level of impact caused. For recreational boats, the use of a particular type of anchor has been shown to be effective in reducing impact in seagrass beds (Milazzo et al. 2004). Evidence for other interventions related to anchoring are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Provide additional moorings to reduce anchoring”, and “Set limits or reduce the area where ships/boats/vessels can anchor”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anchoring can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, disturbance to and penetration in the seabed (Griffiths et al. 2017). Moorings, permanent or temporary, provide an alternative to anchoring and allow for reduced anchoring in the area. Moorings can be provided for recreational vessels, as well as commercial vessels up to specific sizes. The damaging impact to the seabed is contained within the mooring vicinity rather than at multiple anchoring sites. Evidence for other interventions related to anchoring are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Use moorings which reduce or avoid contact with the seabed (eco-moorings)”, “Use a different type of anchor”, and “Set limits or reduce the area where ships/boats/vessels can anchor”.

Background information and definitions:
Vessels can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through disturbance to the seabed and water flow(Hammerstrom et al. 2007). Setting limits on hull depth of vessels (recreational or commercial) entering an area may potentially reduce disturbance to subtidal benthic invertebrates as the hull would be further from the seabed and less likely to result in direct physical damage from collision, grounding, or in changes in water flow or sediment transport (Whitfield et al. 2002).

Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing in an area can remove the most direct pressures to subtidal benthic invertebrates, with the aim of enabling previously impacted populations to recover over time (Jack & Wing 2010). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Cease or prohibit shipping” and “Threat: Biological resource use – Establish temporary fisheries closure”.

Key Messages:

Five studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. All studies were in the North Sea (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, UK).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing developed different overall invertebrate community compositions compared to fished areas.
Overall species richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing did not develop different overall invertebrate species richness and diversity compared to fished areas after three years, but the other found higher species richness in the closed areas after 20 years.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after) in the North Sea found that areas closed to all fishing had similar overall invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to fished areas after three and five years.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing a site to all fishing led to similar numbers of lobster compared to a fished site after 20 months.
Crustacean condition (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing a site to all fishing led to larger sizes of lobster compared to a fished site after 20 months.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Overall community energy flow (1 study): One before-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that, during the 12–14 months after closing an area to all fishing, the invertebrate community structure (measured as energy flow) at sites within the closed area did not change, but that it increased in nearby fished sites.
Species energy flow (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that closing an area to all fishing for 12–14 months had mixed effects on species-level energy flow.

Description: 
2097: Cease or prohibit commercial fishing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing is one of the most wide-spread human impacts on the marine benthic environment (Thrush et al. 1998). It can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage and disturbance from fishing gear such towed trawls and dredges coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000; Watling & Norse 1998). Ceasing or prohibiting commercial fishing in an area, but allowing other types of fishing (for instance recreational fishing, or for research purposes), can remove the most intense direct pressure on subtidal benthic invertebrates, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Hiddink et al. 2017; Kaiser et al. 2006). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities. When this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit commercial fishing”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”, “Cease or prohibit bottom trawling” and “Cease or prohibit dredging”.

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting commercial fishing on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Two studies were in the Tasman Sea (New Zealand), the third on Gorges Bank in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Tasman Sea  found that an area closed to commercial trawling and dredging for 28 years had different overall invertebrate communities than an area subject to commercial fishing.
Overall species richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study on Georges Bank found no difference in invertebrate species richness between an area closed to commercial fishing for 10 to 14 years and a fished area.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Tasman Sea  and on Georges Bank found that areas prohibiting commercial fishing for 10 to 14 years and 28 years had greater overall invertebrate abundance compared to areas where commercial fishing occurred. One of the studies  also found higher biomass, while the other found similar biomass in closed and fished areas.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea found that in commercial fishing exclusion zones lobster abundance was not different to adjacent fished areas after up to two years.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Overall community biological production (1 study): One site comparison study in the Tasman Sea  found that an area closed to commercial trawling and dredging for 28 years had greater biological production from invertebrates than an area where commercial fishing occurred.

Title: Subtidal Benthic Invertebrate Conservation
Description: 
2098: Establish temporary fisheries closures
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Establishing temporary fishery closures in an area can temporarily remove the most direct pressure from fishing to subtidal benthic invertebrates, and provide relief to impacted populations, which are, in theory, able to recover over time during the temporary closure (rotation) (Blyth et al. 2004; Hiddink et al. 2006; Rogers-Bennett et al. 2013). Temporary closures can include for instance: 1) seasonal closures, often done with the aim of protecting adults during the spawning season or to protect juveniles during times of recruitment or settlement, 2) rotational closures during which areas are alternately closed and opened to fishing following a specific timing, or 3) move-on rules whereby temporary closure of a fished area occurs when a catch or by-catch threshold is reached (Dunn et al. 2014). It is important to know how populations change once fisheries resume inside temporary closures, in order to understand whether the closures were effective, if the effects last, and if further measures and/or closures need to be implemented. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use - Cease or prohibit all types of fishing” and “Cease or prohibit commercial fishing”, and in “Habitat protection - Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all types of fishing” and “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit commercial fishing”.

One study was in the English Channel (UK), one in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel (Australia), one in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), two in the Mozambique Channel (Madagascar), and one in the North Sea (UK).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed-gear fishing did not have greater invertebrate species richness than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round.
Mollusc community composition (1 study): One replicated, before-and after study in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to all fishing for 12 years only to recreational fishing led to changes in scallop species community composition over four fishing seasons.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed-gear fishing did not have a greater invertebrate biomass than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in the North Sea found that reopening a site to fishing following a temporary 20-month closure led to lower total abundance but similar marketable abundance of European lobsters compared to a continuously-fished site after a month.
Mollusc abundance (5 studies): One replicated, site comparison study English Channel found that sites seasonally closed to towed gear did not have higher abundance of great scallops than sites where towed-fishing occurred year-round. Two before-and after, site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mozambique Channel found that temporarily closing an area to reef octopus fishing did not increase octopus abundance/biomass compared to before closure and to continuously fished areas. Two replicated, before-and after studies in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel and the North Pacific Ocean found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to all fishing to recreational fishing only led to a decline in scallop abundance after four fishing seasons and in red abalone after three years.
Mollusc condition (3 studies): One replicated, before-and after study in the North Pacific Ocean found that temporarily reopening an area previously closed to fishing led to a decline in the size of red abalone after three years. Two before-and after, site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mozambique Channel found that temporarily closing an area to reef octopus fishing increased the weight of octopus compared to before closure and to continuously fished areas, but one also found that this effect did not last once fishing resumed.

Description: 
2099: Cease or prohibit bottom trawling
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Mobile fishing gear such as bottom trawls are known to be particularly damaging as they are dragged along the seabed. Their use can be stopped or prohibited within an area and only static gears (such as lobster or crab pots/traps) allowed. Ceasing or prohibiting bottom trawling can remove this direct pressure to subtidal benthic invertebrates and potentially allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Hiddink et al. 2017). When this intervention occurs due to the closure of an area to shipping, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – “Cease or prohibit shipping”. When it is in combination with ceasing or prohibiting dredging, but without separating the effects of the two gear, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”. When this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit bottom trawling”.

Key Messages:

Four studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting bottom trawling on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Two studies were in the Bering Sea (USA), one in the North Sea, and one in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after, one replicated) in the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that in areas prohibiting trawling for either 15 or 20 years, overall invertebrate community composition was different to that of trawled areas.
Overall species richness/diversity (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (one paired, one before-and-after, one replicated) in the Bering Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea found that invertebrate diversity was higher in sites closed to trawling compared to trawled sites after either 37 or 15 years, but the other found no differences after 20 years.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies (one paired, one replicated) in the Bering Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that total invertebrate abundance was higher in sites closed to trawling compared to trawled sites after 37 years, but the other found no differences after 20 years. Both found no differences in total invertebrate biomass.
Unwanted catch overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after, site comparison study in the Bering Sea found that during the three years after closing areas to all bottom trawling, unwanted catch of crabs appeared to have decreased, while no changes appeared to have occurred in nearby trawled areas.

2100: Cease or prohibit midwater/semi-pelagic trawling
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are exposed to, including overharvesting (Hobday et al. 2000) and unintentional physical damage or catching during other fishing operations (Collie et al. 2000). Midwater/semi-pelagic trawling, which tows nets at depths higher in the water column (shallower) than bottom trawling, has in theory less impacts on the seabed and benthic invertebrates, as the gear should not come into contact with them. However, midwater trawls sometimes do come into contact with the seabed or with benthic invertebrates, particularly in areas with uneven topography and geological features, such as seamounts (Clark & Koslow 2007; He & Winder 2010). Therefore, ceasing or prohibiting midwater/pelagic trawling in an area can reduce or remove this pressure, and potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Use a semi-pelagic trawl instead of demersal trawl”, and additional evidence related to ghost fishing from abandoned or lost gear is summarised under “Threat: Pollution - Use biodegradable panels in fishing pots” and “Recover lost fishing gear”.

Description: 
2101: Cease or prohibit dredging
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Mobile fishing gear such as towed dredges, for instance used in the harvest of bivalves such as clams and scallops, involves towing a heavy steel frame along the seabed, and are known to be particularly damaging to benthic biota. Ceasing or prohibiting dredges in an area, for instance through bylaws or voluntary agreements (Blyth et al. 2002; Bull 1989; Schejter et al. 2008), can remove this direct pressure to subtidal benthic invertebrates and allow them to potentially recolonise and recover naturally over time (Blyth et al. 2004). Recreational and artisanal bivalve fishing may cause less impact compared to dredging due to the smaller scale of the operations and the harvesting methods used (for instance hand-harvest). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”. When this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit dredging” and “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of scallop”.

Key Messages:

Four studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting dredging on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. One study was in the North Atlantic Ocean (Portugal), one in the South Atlantic Ocean (Argentina), one in the English Channel and one in the Irish Sea (UK).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (3 studies): One of three site comparison studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea found that after ceasing dredging, overall invertebrate community composition was different to that in dredged areas. The other two found that communities remained similar in dredged and non-dredged areas.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One of three site comparison studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea found that after ceasing dredging, large (macro-) invertebrate diversity was higher but small (meio-) invertebrate diversity was lower compared to dredged areas. The other two found that overall diversity remained similar in dredged and non-dredged areas.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): One of three site comparison studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea found that four years after ceasing dredging, large (macro-) and small (meio-) invertebrate abundance and/or biomass appeared higher to that in dredged areas. The other two found that abundance and/or biomass remained similar in dredged and non-dredged areas after either two or six years.
Tunicate abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that a year after ceasing dredging in three areas, abundance of ascidians/sea squirts (tunicates) was similar to that in dredged areas.
Bryozoan abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that a year after ceasing dredging in three areas, abundance of bryozoan was higher than in dredged areas.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that a year after ceasing dredging in three areas, abundance of spider crabs was higher than in dredged areas, but abundance of edible crab was similar.
Cnidarian abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that a year after ceasing dredging in three areas, abundance of sea fans was higher than in dredged areas.
Sponge abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the English Channel found that a year after ceasing dredging in three areas, abundance of sponges was higher than in dredged areas.

2102: Cease or prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Bottom trawls and dredges are mobile fishing gears towed behind a vessel and are known to be particularly damaging as they are dragged onto the seabed (mid-water trawls can also sometimes accidentally come into contact with the seabed). Ceasing or prohibiting all towed gears in an area, for instance through bylaws or voluntary agreements (Blyth et al. 2002), can remove their direct pressure on subtidal benthic invertebrates and potentially allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Blyth et al. 2004). Evidence related to ceasing only trawls or only dredges are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit bottom trawling” and “Cease or prohibit dredging”, respectively. When the cessation of towed fishing gear occurs in the context of a marine protected area, the evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear”.

Key Messages:

Eight studies examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting all towed fishing gear on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. One study was in the Limfjord (Denmark), two in the English Channel (UK), three in Georges Bank in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA and Canada), one in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal), and one in the Irish Sea (Isle of Man).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (3 studies): Two of three replicated, site comparison studies in the Limfjord and the English Channel, found that areas excluding towed fishing gear for either an unspecified amount of time or two to 23 years had different overall invertebrate community composition compared to areas where towed-fishing occurred and one found that ceasing towed-gear fishing for nine years had mixed effects.
Overall species richness/diversity (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in the English Channel reported that areas excluding towed fishing gear for either an unspecified amount of time or two to 23 years had different or greater invertebrate species richness and diversity to areas where towed-fishing occurred. One site comparison study in Georges Bank found no difference in invertebrate species richness between an area closed to mobile fishing gear for 10 to 14 years and a fished area.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the English Channel and Georges Bank found that sites excluding towed gear for either two to 23 years or 10 to 14 years had greater overall invertebrate biomass compared to sites where towed-gear fishing occurred, but one also found that abundance was similar in both areas. One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Ria Formosa lagoon found that ceasing towed gear for 10 months led to increases in the cover of mobile but not sessile
Mollusc abundance (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Irish Sea and the English Channel found that areas closed to towed fishing gear for either two to 23 years or 14 years had more scallops compared to adjacent fished areas.
Mollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study the Irish Sea found that an area closed to towed fishing gear for 14 years had higher proportions of older and larger scallops compared to an adjacent fished area.
Starfish abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Georges Bank found more starfish in areas closed to towed fishing gear for five to nine years compared to adjacent fished areas.
Starfish condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Georges Bank found that starfish arm length was similar in areas closed to towed fishing gear for five to nine years and adjacent fished areas.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Overall community biological production (1 study): One before-and-after, site comparison study in Georges Bank found an increase in the biological production from invertebrate in sites closed to towed fishing gear for approximately five years compared to adjacent fished sites.

2103: Cease or prohibit static fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Static fishing gear such as pots and traps, although usually considered less damaging than mobile gears, can be locally damaging to the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates directly located under or in their vicinity. Ceasing or prohibiting static gears in an area, for instance through bylaws or voluntary agreements (Blyth et al. 2002), can remove their direct pressure to subtidal benthic invertebrates and allow them to recolonise and recover naturally over time (Blyth et al. 2004). When the cessation of static fishing gear occurs in the context of a marine protected area, the evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit static fishing gear”.

2104: Establish territorial user rights for fisheries
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Territorial user rights are area-based fishing rights which allocate secure, exclusive access to fish in a specified area to groups or individuals (Raemaekers et al. 2011). These territorial user rights often have controls on fishing mortality, and fishers are held accountable to comply with these controls. By regulating and limiting fishing effort, establishing territorial user rights can reduce the impact on the seabed, the amount of bycatch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Gelcich & Donlan 2015; Manríquez & Castilla 2001). Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Habitat protection – Establish community-based fisheries management”.

2105: Set commercial catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are exposed to, including overharvesting (Hobday et al. 2000) and unintentional physical damage or catching during other fishing operations (Collie et al. 2000). Commercial fishing and harvest quotas (such as Total Allowable Catch) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources (species stocks). Setting catch quotas for specific fisheries (for instance cod), can potentially reduce the pressure on other species not targeted by the fishery but commonly affected or caught during fishing operations. Evidence for the use of catch quotas in recreational fishing is summarised under “Species management – Set recreational catch quotas”. Evidence for the use of catch quotas in conjunction with habitat credits system is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set catch quotas and habitat credits systems”.

Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are exposed to, including overharvesting (Hobday et al. 2000) and unintentional physical damage or catching during other fishing operations (Collie et al. 2000). Habitat credits systems are fisheries management tools aimed to balance economic and environmental values associated with fisheries. In the case of fisheries, the aim is to address specific conservation goals while having minimal effects for the fisheries.  A set number of habitat credits (or “individual habitat quotas”) are allocated to fishers. Habitat impacts credits are then assigned to specific fishing areas based on their sensitivity to fishing practices; the more sensitive the area, the more habitat credits it will require from the fisher to go and fish there. Setting habitat credits systems for specific exploited areas, can potentially incentivise responsible fishing practices by constraining fishers to a set number of credits or shares of the habitat, while allowing them to change their behaviour (where, when, and how much they fish) (Bastleer et al. 2017). This may reduce the pressure on particularly sensitive areas and their associated species. Direct evidence is limited, but indirect evidence using modelling approaches have shown that habitat credit systems could reduce benthic impacts (Bastleer et al. 2017).
Evidence for the use of habitat credits system in conjunction with catch quotas is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set catch quotas and habitat credits systems”.

Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Traps or pots are often used to fish for crabs or lobsters and consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels, which encourage entry but limit escape. Trap fishery can negatively impact benthic invertebrates by accidentally catching them while in use (Öndes et al. 2017), or when they are lost or abandoned (“ghost fishing” Maselko et al. 2013). The number of traps per fishing vessels could be limited to reduce fishing effort in an area (Acheson 1998), thereby potentially reducing the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2112: Install physical barriers to prevent trawling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Some habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows, are particularly vulnerable to trawling gears. Trawling can be discouraged in certain areas through the positioning of physical barriers, such as concrete blocks or other artificial reefs, to make trawling unfeasible without damaging trawl nets (Liu et al. 2011). This may limit local trawling (and other mobile fishing) effort in the area, thereby reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of bycatch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates. When this intervention occurs within a marine protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Designate a Marine Protected Area and install physical barriers to prevent illegal trawling”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Place anthropogenic installations (e.g: windfarms) in an area such that they create artificial habitat and reduce the level of fishing activity”.

2113: Introduce catch shares
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Catch shares are a type of fisheries management system whereby a secure share of targeted species or fishing area is given to individual fishermen, communities or fisheries associations (Costello et al. 2008). This normally involves the division of allocated catch quotas amongst fishery participants, who can then catch a certain amount of targeted species each year and are responsible for not exceeding that amount. Shares can sometimes be bought or sold. With a secure share of the catch, there can be reduced competition between fishery participants and focus may shift from maximising volume to maximising value, which may reduce fishing effort in the area, thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2114: Purchase fishing permits and/or vessels from fishers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Schemes can be set up where fishing permits and/or vessels are purchased from fishers. This can reduce fishing effort in an area due to fewer fishing boats operating (Gleason et al. 2013), thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Overfishing is thought to be encouraged by fisheries subsidies, which provides funds that go towards building boats, and paying for fuel and fishing gear. By eliminating fisheries subsidies that encourage overfishing (Sumaila & Pauly 2007) fishing effort can be reduced in an area, thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2116: Set unwanted catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In fisheries terms, unwanted catch (sometimes referred to as “bycatch”, although the exact meaning of this term varies) are species whose captures were unintentional or unwanted. For instance, these can include undersize or over quota for species of commercial value, but also species that hold no commercial value. Here, we only consider unintentionally captured species of no commercial value. Some fishing practices can lead to considerable amounts of benthic invertebrate unwanted catch (Davies et al. 2009). Unwanted catch quotas are used to set catch limits for unwanted species. When the quota for a particular species is reached, the fishery may be closed to all forms of fishing likely to catch that species. This may potentially reduce fishing in an area, thereby reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2117: Use hook and line fishing instead of other fishing methods
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hook and line fishing is a term used for a range of fishing methods that use short fishing lines with hooks. Hook and line fishing is more selective than other types of fishing and has little impact on the seabed. In addition, unwanted catch species can often be returned to the sea undamaged because the lines are only in place for a short time. These methods also reduce direct contact with the seabed, any unintentional physical harm and disturbances, and potentially reduce the amount of unwanted catch. For evidence of the effect of this intervention within a marine protected area, see “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and only allow the use hook and line fishing instead of other fishing methods”.

2118: Use a midwater/semi-pelagic trawl instead of bottom/demersal trawl
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Semi-pelagic trawls (also referred to as midwater trawls) are types of trawls where the nets are towed through the water above the seabed, whereas demersal trawls (also referred to as bottom trawls) tow their nets along, or close to, the seabed. Semi-pelagic trawl gear does not come into contact with the seabed, resulting in less damage to the seabed. Using a semi-pelagic trawl instead of a demersal trawl may potentially reduce the impact on the seabed and disturbances or damages to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Moran & Stephenson 2000).

2119: Modify the design of dredges
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Dredging, for instance for bivalves, normally involves towing a heavy steel frame along the seabed, which negatively impacts subtidal benthic invertebrates directly, due to physical damage and the retention of unwanted invertebrate catch, and indirectly by changes to the seabed structure and topography, such as creating dredge tracks (Currie & Parry 1996). Dredge design can be modified in order to reduce or remove negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates, such as changing the tooth spacing or mesh size, or reducing sediment penetration or bottom-contact (Frandsen et al. 2015). Evidence for other interventions related to the use of dredges are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit dredging”, “Use lower water pressure during hydraulic dredging”, “Hand harvest instead of using a dredge”, “ Use an otter trawl instead of a dredge”, “Use alternative means of getting mussel seeds rather than dredging from natural mussel beds”, “Use an otter trawl instead of a dredge”, and in “Species management – Cease or prohibit the harvest of scallops”.

2122: Use alternative means of getting mussel seeds rather than dredging from natural mussel beds
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mussel seeds (young mussels) used in aquaculture are often collected from areas of the seabed where the mussels naturally occur, using dredges. This can be a damaging harvest method, leading to mussel depletion and other negative impacts on other invertebrate species associated with mussel beds due to the impact from the dredge. Alternative means of collecting mussel seeds exist, such as using artificial collectors, or producing seeds in hatchery facilities, rather than dredging from natural beds (Fuentes et al. 1998; Maguire et al. 2008). Using such alternative collection methods can potentially help reduce dredging pressure and associated threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Background information and definitions:
Dredging, for instance for bivalves, normally involves towing a heavy steel frame along the seabed, which negatively impacts subtidal benthic invertebrates due to direct physical damage and the retention of unwanted invertebrate catch, and indirectly by changes to the seabed structure and topography, such as creating dredge tracks (Currie & Parry 1996). Otter trawls have a pair of boards or metal plates (otter boards) which attach to the sides of the net and keep the net open as it is pulled through the water (Schwinghamer et al. 1998). Although otter boards can damage the seabed, they may cause less damage than a dredge due to the limited surface area in contact with the seabed in comparison to a dredge. Using an otter trawl instead of a dredge may potentially lessen the negative impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hinz et al. 2012). Evidence for using other fishing gear instead of an otter trawl is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Use an otter trawl instead of a beam trawl”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Otter trawls have a pair of boards or metal plates (otter boards) which attach to the sides of the net and keep the net open as it is pulled through the water. More than one trawl can be towed simultaneously from the same boat. Towing three trawls behind one boat has been found to retain a lower weight of unwanted fish compared to a single rig in a river in Australia (Broadhurst et al. 2013a). Single and triple rigs have fewer otter boards than double or quad rigs and, therefore, less contact with the seabed, which may have less impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Broadhurst et al. 2013a).  A study in that same Australian river found that there was no difference in the numbers or weight of unwanted fish caught between a double rig (with four otter boards) and a dual rig (with two otter boards) (Broadhurst et al. 2013b).

Other types of fishing methods may be less damaging to the seabed and its invertebrates. Pulse trawling is an adaptation of beam trawling which replaces tickler chains (metal chains which drag along the seabed in front of the net) with electrical drag wires that sends electric pulses into the seabed. Pulse trawls are alternative fishing methods which may potentially cause less damage to the seabed and benthic invertebrates (Despestele et al. 2018; Van Marlen et al. 2014). However, it should be noted that the use of pulse trawls is banned in many fisheries.

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The footrope consists of a rope, wire or chain which is attached to the bottom front of the net (the lower edge of the net mouth) to provide weight to keep the net on or near the seabed. Footrope configuration varies with trawls and the commercial species targeted, and can affect the level of negative impacts on the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hannah et al. 2013). To potentially reduce contact with the seabed, and therefore direct damage and disturbance, the footrope can be raised.

Footrope configuration varies with trawls and the commercial species targeted, and can affect the level of negative impacts on the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates (Hannah et al. 2013). Large, heavy bobbins and rollers can damage the seabed, therefore affecting subtidal benthic invertebrates. Setting limits on their weight and/or size can potentially reduce damage to the seabed and associated impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the maximum weight and/or size of bobbins on the footrope on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.

2131: Fit a funnel (such as a sievenet) or other escape devices on shrimp/prawn trawl nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The net is wide at the opening and narrows to a bag or ‘codend’, tied at the end with a drawstring, where organisms are trapped. Trawl nets can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. To reduce the amount of unwanted organisms, a net can be modified by inserting a funnel-like device (such as a sievenet) before the codend (Santos et al. 2018). This device is designed to direct unwanted catch to an escape hole in the body of the trawl. The idea is that the target species go over the hole in the net, while non-target species can escape through the release hole. These funnel-like devices are usually not made of rigid material and therefore can be more acceptable to fishers than a rigid sorting grid (evidence summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames to trawl nets”).

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. The net is wide at the opening and narrows to a bag or ‘codend’, tied at the end with a drawstring, where organisms are trapped. Trawl nets can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. Standard trawl nets are made from diamond-shaped mesh. To potentially reduce the amount of unwanted organisms, a net can be modified by fitting one or more mesh “escape panels” in the outer mesh of the net before the codend (Brčić et al. 2017; Fonteyne & Polet 2002; Revill & Jennings 2005). These panels are sections of netting made from a different mesh design than the rest of the net, for instance made from square mesh or large diamond mesh. The panels are designed to allow smaller unwanted organisms to escape, while retaining the commercially targeted ones. Mesh panels, which are also referred to as escape windows, escape zones, and drop-out panels, or more generally as “bycatch reduction devices”, can be fitted directly before the codend, or elsewhere on the main body of the net such as behind the groundrope. Here, we included escape zones such as “Bigeye” and “Fisheye” devices, as although they do not strictly use mesh sections, they have similar functions of letting organisms escape through a specific area of the net.

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats.

2139: Modify the design/attachments of a shrimp/prawn W-trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a cone-shaped fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Trawling can be particularly damaging to benthic invertebrates as they are dragged along the seabed (mid-water trawls can also sometimes accidentally come into contact with the seabed). In addition, trawl nets, and in particular W-trawls used in the prawn/shrimp/nephrops fishery, can catch a considerable number of unwanted organisms, including non-commercially targeted species and organisms under the legal-size limit. To reduce the level of disturbance to the seabed and the amount of unwanted organisms caught, the design and/or attachments of the W-trawl net can be modified, for instance by securing the netting at the wing ends, pulling the top tongue of the net forward, modifying the attachment of the ground chain or by using a combination of such modifications (Balash et al. 2016).

2140: Reduce the number or modify the arrangement of tickler chains/chain mats on trawl nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more boats. Beam trawls are rigged with either tickler chains stretching from one side of the trawl mouth to the other, or a stone mat. Tickler chains are metal chains which drag along the seabed in front of the net with the aim of disturbing fish in the path of the trawl, causing them to enter the net. A chain mat is a network of chains over the trawl’s mouth designed to prevent large stones from entering the gear while also disturbing fish that are then caught in the net. Chain and mats can therefore disturb the seabed as well as increase unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrates. To potentially reduce these unwanted effects, fewer tickler chains can be used, or the arrangement of chains and mats can be modified (Van Marlen et al. 2005), for example by attaching only one end of the chain to the beam, or reducing the size of the chain links (Bergman & Van Santbrink 2000; Broadhurst et al. 2015).
Evidence for other interventions related to fishing gear modifications is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use”.

2141: Use a larger mesh size on trammel nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some fisheries use static nets, such as trammel nets, that are left in the water to passively catch the commercially targeted species. Trammel nets are a wall of netting, usually comprised of three layers:  a slack central layer with a small mesh sandwiched between two outer layers with a much larger mesh. The net is kept vertical by floats on the headrope and weights on the bottom rope. Trammels are considered to have less environmental impact than trawl nets, as they have minimal contact with the seabed and are more species and size-selective, however they have been shown to also result in some unwanted catch of invertebrates (Erzini et al. 2006; Gonçalves et al. 2007). To reduce the amount of unwanted catch in trammel net fishing, the mesh size can be increased, to potentially allow more organisms to escape (Gonçalves et al. 2008).

2142: Use traps instead of fishing nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing nets can have poor selectivity, leading to high amounts of unwanted catch, and also can negatively impact the seabed and benthic communities due to physical contact and disturbance (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016). Although fishing nets and traps usually target different species and are used in different fisheries,  in certain cases, they can target and catch the same species. Replacing fishing nets with traps and pots where feasible can help reduce the impacts on invertebrate populations, through a reduction in physical disturbances and a reduction in unwanted catch. For instance, trammel nets used in lobster fisheries could be replaced with traps (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016).
Evidence for other interventions related to trap and pot fishery is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Modify the position of traps”, “Modify the design of traps”, “Use a different bait species in traps”, “Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps” and “Fit one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps”.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). Trap design can be modified, such as by using different shape or material for the frame (Amengual-Ramis et al. 2016; Major et al. 2017), to potentially reduce the amount of subtidal benthic invertebrate bycatch (Arrasate-López et al. 2012; Schoeman et al. 2002).
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Modify the position of traps” and “Use different bait species in traps”.

Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted catch species (Stevens 1996). The position of traps can be modified, for example by floating traps in the water above the seabed rather than placing them static on the seabed (Furevik et al. 2008), to potentially reduce the amount of certain species of subtidal benthic invertebrate accidentally caught.

Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted catch species (Stevens 1996). Traps or pots can also be baited to further encourage entry. By using a different bait species, for instance one that is less attractive to certain unwanted catch species, the amount of unwanted catch can potentially be reduced (Major et al. 2017).

Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted species (Stevens 1996). To try to minimise the amount of unwanted catch from this type of fishing, a device such as a rigid frame or rigid wires can be fitted to the entrance of the trap, or other types of “excluder devices” can be used, to reduce the likelihood of unwanted species entering, but also to allow small unwanted species to escape (Broadhurst et al. 2014). Such devices have been effective in reducing accidental catches of seabirds (Morris et al. 2011), seals (Königson et al. 2015), and terrapins (Roosenburg & Green 2000), and therefore may be considered when trying to reduce unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrate species.

Background information and definitions:
Trawling can lead to the capture large amounts of unwanted catch species. Animals caught in trawling nets can die from injuries sustained in the net, during handling, or when the catch is processed (Revill & Jennings 2005). Releasing live unwanted catch of subtidal benthic invertebrates before handling/processing the commercially targeted species may increase their chances of survival following release back into the water, because they would have been out of the water for less time.

2151: Modify harvest methods of macroalgae
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The commercial harvest of macroalgae (e.g. kelp) can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through removal of the plant itself, direct physical damage and removal of invertebrates, or through disturbance to the seabed (Pirker 2002; Stagnol et al. 2016). The harvest method can be modified in an attempt to prevent such negative impacts. For instance, harvesting macroalgal blades rather than mechanically removing the whole plant can reduce disturbances to the seabed and retain some benefit of macroalgal canopy (Levitt et al. 2002). Increasing the time between consecutive harvests can also potentially help reduce the pressure and allow for natural recovery. Similarly, harvesting patches of macroalgae rather than entire areas can potentially allow natural recolonization of subtidal benthic invertebrates from nearby unharvested patches.

2152: Limit, cease or prohibit access for recreational purposes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
 
Recreational activities can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species or habitat removal, physical damage, disturbance (Milazzo et al. 2002) or pollution (Harriott et al. 1997). Boat and other forms of access for recreational purposes could be limited, by restricting access in space and time (duration and occurrence). Permanent or temporary closure could be put in place, or access prohibited through bylaws. Stopping or restricting the access for recreational purposes may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with boating and recreational activities, such as harvesting, angling, or diving, and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time.
When restrictions of recreational activities occur in the context of a marine protected area, evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection”, including “Habitat protection - Designate a Marine Protected Area and set a no-anchoring zone”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of scallops”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of conch” and “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of sea urchins”.

Recreational activities such as diving can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage to species and habitats, and disturbance to sediment and organisms (Harriott et al. 1997; Luna et al. 2009). Recreational diving could be limited, by restricting access in space and time (duration and occurrence) or restricting the type of gears divers are allowed to carry. It could be ceased by setting a permanent or temporary closure, or prohibited through bylaws. This may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with diving and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Recreational harvesting (free divers, spear fishers) and fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal, either intentionally, or unintentionally through accidental unwanted catch (in the case of fishing), physical damage and disturbance (Cooke & Cowx 2006; Milazzo et al. 2002). Recreational fishing and harvesting could be limited in one area, by restricting the activity in space and time (limits on duration and occurrence, delimiting allowed areas). It could be ceased by setting a permanent or temporary closure (e.g. seasonal closure), or prohibited through bylaws. This may help reduce the intensity of the threats associated with these activities and potentially allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to persist or recover over time.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native species are known to negatively affect local native communities (Arthur et al, 2009; Campbell & Hewitt 2008; Molnar et al. 2008). Non-native species are commonly used worldwide for aquaculture purposes due to their economic value (for instance, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea (also known as Magallana) gigas is importantly produced in the UK despite not being native). Using native species for aquaculture instead of non-native species removes the risk of introducing non-native species into an area, either intentionally (from at sea culture) or accidentally (as escapees from hatchery facilities; Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013; Campbell 2009; Campbell 2011). Culturing native species may also reduce pressure on native species populations by displacing the harvest effort from native stocks to aquaculture stocks (Andriahajaina & Hockley 2007).

The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of diseases, and non-native and other problematic species into the wild marine environment (Bax et al. 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Manchester & Bullock 2000). There, they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010).

Description: 
2158: Use sterile individuals in aquaculture systems using non-native species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native species are commonly used worldwide for aquaculture purposes due to their economic value (for instance, the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas is importantly produced in the UK despite not being native). The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of non-native species into the wild marine environment (Bax et al. 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Manchester & Bullock 2000), where they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through hybridization (reproduction). This could be potentially avoided by using only sterile individuals of a non-native species in aquaculture (Thresher et al. 2009). However, for this to be a fully effective intervention, advances in polyploidy aquaculture and genetic containment need to occur, given that sterile individuals have been shown to revert over time and that polyploidy can have negative outcomes (e.g. Piferer et al. 2009; Zajicek et al. 2011).

Description: 
2159: Source spat and juveniles from areas or hatcheries not infested with diseases or non-native or problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of diseases, and non-native and other problematic species into the wild marine environment (Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013; Bax et al. 2003; Campbell & Hewitt 2008; Manchester & Bullock 2000). There, they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010; Fitridge et al. 2012). Spat is the name used for very young shellfish, usually mussels or oysters. In aquaculture, spat, as well as juveniles (young adults), can be obtained from hatchery facilities or from natural stocks. Spat and juveniles are then cultured at sea and will grow into marketable adults. Depending on the water quality at the site spat and juveniles are sourced from, individuals can carry diseases and non-native or problematic species, either inside them or on their shell (Brenner et al. 2014). The introduction of diseases, non-native and other problematic species to a new environment could be potentially avoided by only selecting spat and juveniles from non-infested areas and hatcheries, for instance accredited or certified facilities.

2160: Import spat and/or eggs to aquaculture facilities rather than juveniles and adults to reduce the risk of introducing hitchhiking species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of diseases, and non-native and other problematic species into the wild marine environment (Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013; Bax et al. 2003; Campbell & Hewitt 2008; Manchester & Bullock 2000). There, they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010; Fitridge et al. 2012). In aquaculture, importing juveniles (young adults) or adults into farming facilities is a common practice, but can lead to the accidental release of non-native or problematic species that hitchhiked on/in them during transport. By importing spat (very young shellfish, usually mussels or oysters) and/or eggs instead, the risk of transporting and releasing these hitchhikers can potentially be reduced.

Description: 
2161: Reduce and/or eradicate aquaculture escapees in the wild
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of non-native and other problematic species into the wild marine environment, referred to as escapees (Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013; Bax et al. 2003; Manchester & Bullock, 2000). There, they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010). Managing the spread of escapees, either by reducing their populations or trying to eradicate them when feasible (Herbert et al. 2016), can potentially reduce the threat level and associated risks on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species. Additionally, revising the existing spacing systems for farms, using innovative siting systems, and improving cage technologies and operational routines, could be effective means of reducing the likelihood of escapees (Arechavaia-Lopez et al. 2013)

Description: 
2162: Prevent the attachment of biofouling organisms/species in aquaculture
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
While aquaculture facilities can be partly located on land (hatcheries), most of it occurs at sea, in cages, pens, bags, or ropes exposed to the marine environment. They represent hard structures onto which organisms can attach and grow – those organisms are known as the biofouling community. Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can be part of this biofouling community (Fitridge et al. 2012) and use aquaculture structures as “stepping stones” to spread and reach new areas to colonize (Ruiz et al. 1997). They can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010). Preventing the attachment of biofouling organisms can potentially help reduce the risks that invasive, non-native and other problematic biofouling species pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Non-fouling material, anti-fouling paints or coatings can be used for aquaculture infrastructures to prevent attachment (Fitridge et al. 2012).
Evidence for other interventions related to biofouling are summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Remove biofouling organisms/species in aquaculture”, “Clean anthropogenic platforms, structures or equipment”, “Use antifouling coatings on the surfaces of vessels and anthropogenic structures”, “Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces” and “Restrict the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings”.

Non-native, invasive and problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010). Regularly removing biofouling organisms can potentially help reduce the risks that invasive, non-native and other problematic biofouling species pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Biofouling species can be manually or mechanically removed by introducing biological agents (such as a predatory species), or by undertaking regular cleaning of infrastructures (Fitridge et al. 2012). When removing biofouling care must be taken to ensure that biofouled marine debris is not created, as these can float to new destinations where these biofouling species can spread (Campbell et al. 2017).

2164: Limit, cease or prohibit ballast water exchange in specific areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Ballasting is the process by which sea water (ballast water) is taken in and out of the ship when the ship is at port or at sea. Ballast water can therefore contain species from one location taken-up during water intake, which are then accidentally released in a new environment during de-ballasting (water release). Ballast water is one of the major processes of introduction of non-native, invasive and problematic species (Barry et al. 2008; Hewitt 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Molnar et al. 2008). Limiting, ceasing, or prohibiting ballast water exchange in specific areas may potentially help prevent the introduction, the establishment and the spread of non-native species and potentially invasive species. Limiting introduction, establishment and spread of such species could be achieved by setting new zone boundaries where ballasting is allowed, setting timing where risk is reduced, or setting limits on the number of ships allowed to ballast at any given time.
Related evidence is summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Treat ballast water before exchange”.

2166: Clean the hull, anchor and chain of commercial and recreational vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Commercial vessels are major means of trans-oceanic transport of non-native species, while recreational boating is known to facilitate the local spread once in a new environment (Campbell & Hewitt 1999; Clarke et al. 2011; Hewitt et al. 2004). Non-native species can become attached to the hard surfaces of ships and boats, including the hull, anchor, and chain, and be accidentally transported from one location to another (Campbell & Hewitt 1999; Hewitt et al. 2004). Regular cleaning of hulls, anchors and chains can potentially reduce the risk of introduction to new location, and as such reduce the risk non-native species pose to native subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence related to the cleaning of surfaces is summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Clean anthropogenic platforms, structures or equipment”.

2167: Clean anthropogenic platforms, structures or equipment
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Non-native species can become attached to the hard surfaces of anthropogenic structures, such as oil rigs, wind farms, pontoons, or buoys, which then act as “stepping stones” for their introduction into new environments (Adams et al. 2014; Bulleri & Airoldi 2005; Mineur et al. 2012). Regular cleaning of these structures can potentially reduce the risk of introduction to new location, and as such reduce the risk non-native species pose to native subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence related to the cleaning of surfaces is summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Clean the hull, anchor and chain of commercial and recreational vessels”.

2168: Use antifouling coatings on the surfaces of vessels and anthropogenic structures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Non-native species can become attached to the hard surfaces of vessels and anthropogenic structures, such as ship hull, anchors and chains, oil rigs, wind farms, pontoons, or buoys, which then act as “stepping stones” for their introduction into new environments (Adams et al. 2014; Bulleri & Airoldi 2005; Mineur et al. 2012). Using antifouling coating can potentially prevent the attachment of non-native (and native) species, hence reduce the risk of introduction to new location and the risk non-native species pose to native subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for other interventions related to antifouling coatings are summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces” and “Restrict the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings”.

2169: Limit, cease or prohibit the sale and/or transportation of commercial non-native species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can be introduced through trade, for instance by purchasing and using non-native live bait for angling (Kilian et al. 2012) or the importation of microalgae for aquaculture feed (Campbell 2011). Restricting or ceasing the sale and transportation of such species, as well as putting additional management controls in place such as disposing of live non-native species on land rather than at sea, may potentially help reduce the risk they pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates, through a reduction in introduction and spread.

Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Some individuals of non-native, invasive or other problematic species could be genetically modified (for instance by introducing Trojan sex chromosomes) and introduced to the population to reduce their environmental tolerance, fitness or reproductive capacity (Allendorf & Lundquist 2003; Cotton & Wedekind 2007). This can potentially reduce their ability to hybridize with native species, but also reduce their population over time and with it the threats they pose to native species.

Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Biocides are chemical substances or microorganisms used with the intention of controlling a problematic species (Fitridge et al. 2012; Thresher & Kuris 2004). Using biocides or other chemicals, such as chemical inhibitors, to reduce or control the population of non-native, invasive or other problematic species can lower the risk they pose to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Biological controls can be used to try to reduce the population of non-native, invasive or other problematic species (Fitridge et al. 2012; Thresher & Kuris 2004). Forms of biological controls include the release of native or non-native predators, parasites, or diseases likely to affect specific non-native, invasive or other problematic species. It should be kept in mind that using native species as biological controls is always a preferred safer option than using non-native ones (Thresher & Kuris 2004).

2173: Remove or capture non-native, invasive or other problematic species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Non-native, invasive and other problematic species can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (from pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Molnar et al. 2008; Bishop et al. 2010). Physical removal can be used to attempt to control populations of non-native, invasive or other problematic species (Hewitt et al. 2005; Thresher & Kuris 2004). Physical removal can be achieved by using tools (Piazzi & Ceccherelli 2006), manually (Hewitt et al. 2005; Wright et al. 2005), or through capture (Calderwood et al. 2015). Capture can be carried out for instance by using sex pheromones or baited traps to attract the target species (Calderwood et al. 2015).
For example, problematic overgrazing sea urchins, for instance due to range extension, can cause a shift from kelp forests to barren areas (Wright et al. 2005). Their removal can allow for the kelp forest to recover over time (Wright et al. 2005), and in turn help subtidal benthic invertebrates associated with kelp forest recover as well.

2174: Use of non-native, invasive or other problematic species from populations established in the wild for recreational or commercial purposes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some non-native, invasive or other problematic species have potential recreational or commercial use and therefore could be valuable. For such species, such as the edible Pacific oyster Crassostrea (also known as Magallana) gigas or Wakame kelp, Undaria pinnatifida in the UK (Epstein & Smale, 2017), management of populations established in the wild could potentially be through intentional recreational or commercial harvest (Nuñez et al. 2012; Pasko et al. 2014). For instance, a campaign called “Eat Lionfish” in 2010 aimed to promote the capture of the lionfish Pterois volitans, which is invasive in many parts of the world, for human consumption (Franke 2007; Nuñez et al. 2012). However, it is possible that enabling collection/hunting/fishing of introduced, non-native, or problematic marine species can lead to unintentional, perverse incentives to maintain an invasive population (Campbell et al. 2009). This may lead to acceptance of introduced marine species, with a reduced motivation to act to eradicate and/or manage invasive, non-native, and problematic species, which is often against International Treaties that a country may be signatory to (Campbell et al. 2009). Experts advise that a balance needs to be considered and struck between controlling/eradicating and creating unintentional perverse incentives to maintain a population of non-native, introduced, or problematic marine species (Simberloff et al. 2011).

2175: Transplant/translocate ‘bioremediating’ species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some sources of pollution, for instance from sewage outfalls, aquaculture farms, or agriculture wastes in watercourses, can cause an excess in nutrients leading to eutrophication, phytoplankton blooms, and reduction in water quality such as reduced light and oxygen. This type of pollution can be biologically ‘remediated’ (reverse, removed, or counteracted) by transplanting or translocating particular species to the affected area (Sode et al. 2013). These species, called ‘bioremediating species’ can naturally improve water quality through feeding (for instance filter-feeding species such as mussels), or through photosynthesis (for instance algae species) (Chung et al. 2002). Transplanting or translocating such species to a polluted area may reduce pollution levels and allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to recover over time (Sode et al. 2013).
Evidence for interventions related to pollution bioremediation are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use other bioremediation methods in aquaculture”, and evidence related to transplantation and/or translocation of species are summarised under the chapter “Species management”.

2176: Add chemicals or minerals to sediments to remove or neutralise pollutants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine sediments can accumulate pollutants over time, such as those leaching from aquaculture systems, sewage outfalls, or nearby agriculture fields, and negatively affect subtidal benthic invertebrates. Chemicals or minerals can be added to sediments to reduce or remove pollutants within the sediments (Shin & Kim 2016; Yamamoto et al. 2013). For example, granulated coal ash can be used with the aim of reducing concentrations of phosphates and hydrogen sulphide (Kim et al. 2014). This may reduce pollution levels in the sediment at the treated area and allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to recover over time (Kim et al. 2014).

Background information and definitions:
Sudden acute pollution events, for instance oil spills, can cause serious disturbances and harm to marine life (White et al. 2012). Pollution emergency plans provide an overview of possible procedures, as well as details of which authorities to contact, in case of a pollution event. The aim of emergency plans is to increase the speed and effectiveness of response, should a pollution event occur (Li et al. 2016; Qiao et al. 2002). Establishing emergency plans may benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates through a faster response and a more efficient control of the pollution, should such event occur.

2180: Set or improve minimum sewage treatment standards
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Untreated sewage reaching the marine environment can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles, and through changes in salinity (McGann et al. 2003). Setting minimum sewage treatment standards, or improving the standards already in place, could potentially ensure that pollution level and associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates are minimized. For instance, improving standards can be achieved by installing a secondary treatment involving the mechanical and biological removal of settleable solids and dissolved organic compounds (Bustamante et al. 2012).
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of untreated sewage”, “Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of sewage sludge” and “Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow”.

2181: Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some sewer systems collect rainwater runoff, sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe, where it is then transported to a sewage treatment plant. During heavy rainfall events or snow melt the volume of wastewater can exceed the capacity of treatment facilities. In such instances, sewer systems can overflow and discharge untreated storm water and wastewater directly into rivers and seas (Moffa 1997). Untreated storm and wastewater can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, solid particles and changes in salinity (Bustamante et al. 2012). Limiting the amount of untreated storm and waste waters overflowing, for instance by increasing the capacity of treatment facilities, can potentially reduce pollution levels and associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Field & Struzeski 1972).
Evidence for interventions related to sewage pollution are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of untreated sewage”, “Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of sewage sludge” and “Set or improve minimum sewage treatment standards”.

2182: Use double hulls to prevent oil spills
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can be disastrous to marine life, including subtidal benthic invertebrates (White et al. 2012). Double hulls, where the bottom and sides of ships have two layers of watertight surfaces, can be used to prevent oil spills and have been required in some countries since the 1990s (Alcock 1992). Double hulls can reduce vessel damage to tankers when involved in accidents, and their use has been shown to significantly reduce the number of oil spills (Glen 2010; Yip et al. 2011). Using double hulls may potentially reduce the risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates from pollution following accidental oil spills.
Evidence for other interventions related to oil pollution are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Remove or clean-up oil pollution following a spill”.

2183: Remove or clean-up oil pollution following a spill
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can be disastrous to marine life, including subtidal benthic invertebrates (White et al. 2012). The control and remediation of oil spills can be undertaken in a multitude of ways: for instance by using booms (floating barriers that contain a spill to a delimited zone) and skimmers (devices that collect and remove oil) to remove oil pollution from the surface of the water, using dispersants that break oil into small droplets (Hartwick et al. 1982), using sorbents, or using controlled burning of the oil (Al-Majed et al. 2012). Different methods have different outcomes and side-effects, but when successful may potentially reduce the risks of toxicity and direct harm to subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use double hulls to prevent oil spills” and “Establish pollution emergency plans”.

2184: Set regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 to 1993, until it was banned in 1993 following international treaties. However, enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Disposal within the sediment (sub-sea burial) was never implemented and such process currently falls under the ban of nuclear waste disposal at sea. However, it is being proposed by various countries and may be an option in the future (Hollister & Nadis 1998). Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of nuclear waste can help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2185: Cease or prohibit aquaculture activity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Ceasing or prohibiting aquaculture activity in an area, for instance by decommissioning farms or relocation to a different area, would remove the source of pollution and potentially allow for subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to recover over time (Johannessen et al. 1994). Aquaculture systems also pose serious environment risks by promoting the spread of non-native, invasive, and pest species and diseases.
Evidence for interventions related to non-native, invasive and pest species is summarised in “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Aquaculture”.

2186: Reduce aquaculture stocking densities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). To limit the amount of pollution emitted by one aquaculture site, stocking density could be reduced (Naylor et al. 2000). A lower number of organisms in one area will produce less waste and limit organic enrichment. This may potentially reduce the level of impact in the vicinity of the aquaculture site and allow some recovery of the subtidal benthic invertebrate community.

2187: Locate aquaculture systems in already impacted areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). By locating aquaculture systems in areas that already have poor water quality (for instance due to sewage outfall), the source of pollution is restricted to that already impacted zone. This may potentially relieve other areas from additional pollution, without significantly further degrading the already impacted area which likely already holds an impacted subtidal benthic invertebrate community.

2188: Locate aquaculture systems in areas with fast currents
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact subtidal benthic invertebrate communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). For instance, it can cause anoxic conditions (lack of oxygen) due to waste build up from fish food and faeces. Locating aquaculture systems in areas with fast currents may help maintain water quality by increasing water exchange, allowing greater dispersal and dilution of pollutant loads (Hall-Spencer et al. 2006; Sarà et al. 2006). Reducing the risk of a built-up of pollution levels may prevent negative impacts on subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Aquaculture systems can be located in areas with submerged vegetation, such as seagrass or kelp, which can help absorb the waste product effluents and mitigate the pollution originating from the installations (Mirto et al. 2010). This may help locally reduce or mitigate the deterioration in water quality in the area and benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Instead of mooring a cage in a fixed position, cages can be moored so they move in response to changes in currents. This may help disperse and dilute the accumulation of wastes and organic matter from fish food and faeces, thereby reducing the pollution levels in the area (Goudey et al. 2001; Sarà et al. 2006).

2191: Leave a fallow period during fish/shellfish farming
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Fallow periods (temporary cessation of production) are often used in aquaculture to mitigate the environmental effects of pollution from organic enrichment due to the stocking of fish, i.e. wastes from fish food and faeces. By temporarily stopping production, pollution is reduced, potentially allowing invertebrate subtidal communities to naturally recover over time until production is resumed (Lin & Bailey-Brock 2008; Zhulay et al. 2015).
Other evidence related to aquaculture activities are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Aquaculture” including “Cease or prohibit aquaculture activity”.

2192: Improve fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Fish food in aquaculture is an important source of pollution because it is not always consumed by the farmed species and may sink to the seabed, leading to localised organic enrichment. Improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste may reduce localised pollution and the associated threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates. This could be achieved by improving pellet aggregate strength, meaning that the pellet is less likely to break up, or by reducing the sinking rate of feed and pellets, both allowing more time for the cultured species to consume the food, thereby reducing the amount reaching the seabed (Cho & Bureau 1997; Wu 1995).

2193: Reduce the amount of pesticides used in aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides are used in aquaculture to reduce or eliminate pests. For example, the carbaryl pesticide Sevin is commonly used in the USA to control ghost shrimp Callianassa californiensis and mud shrimp Upogebia pugettensis in oyster culture (Weston 2000). Pesticides, however, have the potential to negatively impact non-target species, such as subtidal benthic invertebrates. This has been shown in the salmon aquaculture, where pesticides used against sea lice caused harm to crustaceans and worms (Mayor et al. 2009; Waddy et al. 2002). The risks associated with the use of pesticides can be reduced by applying them smaller doses, less frequently or across a smaller area. This may reduce the negative effects on subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for interventions related to the use of antibiotics are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Reduce the amount of antibiotics used in aquaculture systems”.

2194: Reduce the amount of antibiotics used in aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Antibiotics are used in aquaculture to reduce or eliminate harmful bacteria (Burridge et al. 2010). Because they are selected for specific species and bacteria, they usually have low toxicity to other organisms. However, some antibiotics have been shown to accumulate and persist in sediments, with potential negative effects to subtidal benthic invertebrates, such as antibiotic resistance (Burridge et al. 2010; Cabello 2006). The risks associated with the use of antibiotics can be reduced by applying them smaller doses, less frequently or across a smaller area. In addition, research has shown that alternatives to antibiotics can be used successfully in aquaculture (Defoirdt et al. 2011). This may reduce the negative effects on subtidal benthic invertebrates, or even remove the source of the threat, and allow for natural recovery.
Evidence for interventions related to the use of pesticides are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Reduce the amount of pesticides used in aquaculture systems”.

2195: Use species from more than one level of a food web in aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture is a type of aquaculture set-up where a number of complementary species from different levels of the food web are cultured at one site in order to optimize nutrient utilization and reduce waste (‘Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010). It is considered an effective biological method of removing organic enrichment from aquaculture (bioremediation’; Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010; Naylor et al. 2000; Troell et al. 2009). In integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, the waste from one species becomes a source of energy for another. For instance, the waste of a fed finfish becomes the food of a filter-feeding mussel, whose waste is then taken up by sea urchins, while seaweeds also use the excess nutrients in the water through photosynthesis (Nobre et al. 2010). By moving toward a better ecosystem balance, such multi-trophic systems have the potential to improve water quality at aquaculture sites and benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2196: Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems (and vice versa) to act as biofilters
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Artificial reefs host a high biodiversity, including filter-feeding organisms, and stimulate the biological productivity around them, even in the surrounding soft sediments (Ambrose & Anderson 1990). By placing artificial reefs near aquaculture systems, they can act as natural biofilters following colonisation, improving water quality, and potentially benefitting surrounding subtidal benthic invertebrates (Aguado-Giménez et al. 2011; Angel et al. 2002; Gao et al. 2008).
Evidence of other interventions related to the relocation of aquaculture activities are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate aquaculture systems in already impacted areas”, “Locate aquaculture systems in locations with fast currents”, and “Locate aquaculture systems in vegetated areas”. Other evidence related to the creation of artificial reefs are summarised in the “Habitat restoration and creation” chapter.

2197: Use other bioremediation methods in aquaculture
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aquaculture systems can negatively impact invertebrate subtidal communities through pollution and diminished water quality (Wu et al. 1994). Various biological methods can be used to remove such pollution (‘bioremediation’; Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010), including better managing the use and dosage of chemicals, better managing fish food, using integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, locating or relocating aquaculture farms to specific areas, or placing artificial reefs nearby to act as biofilters [these interventions are summarised above]. Other methods can be used to mitigate pollution from aquaculture, such as microbial nitrification and denitrification in sediments, or the use of technological applications such as mechanical and biological filters (Chávez-Crooker et al. 2010). Using bioremediation methods may help improve water quality at aquaculture sites and reduce the risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates from pollution.

2198: Regulate the use, dosage and disposal of agrichemicals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Agrichemicals (or agrochemicals) are chemicals used in agriculture, such as pesticides, fertilisers and manure. They are designed to have long-lasting effects on living organisms, are often toxic to non-target species, and as such are considered a major source of pollution and toxicity in aquatic environments (Islam & Tanaka 2004; Rawlings et al. 1998). Agrichemicals can reach the marine environment through soil erosion, rivers, and other watercourse runoffs. There, they can accumulate in the seabed sediment and affect subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of excess nutrients and toxic substances (Islam & Tanaka 2004). The use, dosage and disposal of agrichemicals can potentially be regulated with the aim of reducing their environmental impacts. This would likely limit or reduce the amount that enters the marine environment and reduce the risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates associated with this pollution.
Evidence for other interventions related to pollution from agriculture are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Treat wastewater from intensive livestock holdings”, “Establish aquaculture to extract the nutrients from run-offs” and “Create artificial wetlands to reduce the amount of pollutants reaching the sea”.

Intensive agriculture constitutes an important source of pollution to the marine environment. Agriculture waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourse runoffs and be discharged into the sea (Rawlings et al. 1998). For instance, wastewater from intensive livestock holdings can introduce bacteria, excess nutrients and solid particles. Treating wastewater from intensive livestock holdings may reduce pollution levels in the marine environment and reduce associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes an important source of pollution to the marine environment. Agriculture waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourse runoffs and be discharged into the sea (Rawlings et al. 1998). For instance, wastewaters can introduce agrichemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients and solid particles, which negatively impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Rawlings et al. 1998). Some species can naturally improve water quality through feeding (for instance filter-feeding species such as mussels), or through photosynthesis (for instance algae species) (Chung et al. 2002). Establishing aquaculture systems near polluted areas from agriculture runoffs and wastewaters in order to extract nutrients may be an effective biological method of pollution removal (‘bioemediation’; Desilva et al. 2000), which may reduce pollution levels and allow subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to recover over time.

Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes an important source of pollution to the marine environment. Agriculture waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourse runoffs and be discharged into the sea (Rawlings et al. 1998). For instance, wastewaters can introduce agrichemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients and solid particles, which negatively impact on subtidal benthic invertebrates (Rawlings et al. 1998). Artificial wetlands can be created with the aim of retaining agricultural pollution (Smiley & Alfred 2011). For instance, solid particles sink in areas of slow water flow and plants growing on the wetlands can remove excess nutrients (Brix 1994). Creating artificial wetlands near agricultural lands may reduce the amount of pollutants reaching the marine environment and reduce associated risks to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2202: Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial and recreational vessels can generate large amounts of garbage and solid waste (Butt 2007). Wastes discharged overboard from vessels can sink to the seabed and impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area may reduce or stop the source of pollution and allow subtidal benthic invertebrates to recover over time. However, solid waste can accumulate and subsist in the marine environment for a long time due to very slow degradation (Andrady 2015; Pham et al. 2014), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting discharge alone might not be sufficient.
Evidence for intervention related to the discharge of waste effluents is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels”.

2203: Install stormwater traps or grids
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Litter can enter the marine environment through a multitude of pathways. Urban debris can enter the marine environment in unprocessed stormwaters running off from land via stormwater conduits and drainage systems (Armitage & Rooseboom 2000). Once in the marine environment, litter can accumulate and subsist for a long time due to very slow degradation (Andrady 2015). Litter can negatively affect subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, smothering and habitat modification, but also through the introduction of bacteria, nutrients, toxic substances and other solid particles (Gall & Thompson 2015). Stormwater traps or grids are designed to prevent litter from entering stormwaters (Armitage & Rooseboom 2000; Phillips 1999). Their installation can potentially reduce the amount of urban litter entering the marine environment, and reduce the risks associated with this pollution on subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for intervention related to pollution from sewage system is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Set or improve minimum sewage treatment standards”, and “Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing is an important source of marine litter (Matsuoka et al. 2005). Once in the marine environment, discarded or lost fishing gears, often referred to as ‘ghost fishing’ (Matsuoka et al. 2005), can accumulate and subsist for a long time due to very slow degradation. There, it can harm subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, entanglement, smothering and habitat modification (Gilardi et al. 2010). Biodegradable panels can be used in fishing pots so that they degrade over time in the marine environment, without harmful effects (Bilkovic et al. 2012). By using biodegradable panels on fishing pots, the risk of subtidal benthic invertebrates getting caught in lost or discarded pots is potentially reduced, or if they are caught, they may be able to escape as the pots degrade.
Evidence for interventions related to pollution from fishing gear are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Recover lost fishing gear”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Emission of electromagnetic fields is associated with electricity production during the operational phase of offshore renewable energy installations (Gill 2005; Inger et al. 2009). In particular, the electromagnetic fields emitted by subsea cables (transmitting power between devices and the mainland) have been shown to affect benthic species sensitive to electromagnetic fields, including subtidal invertebrates such as the edible crab Cancer pagurus (Scott et al. 2019) and the American lobster, Hommarus americanus (Hutchison et al. 2018). Industry standards and good practice require that all subsea cables in the water of up to 1,500 m should be buried in the seabed (Carter et al. 2009). Burying subsea cables in an area might help reduce the effects of electromagnetic fields on subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Artificial lighting at night, including urban lighting from street lights and houses, industrial lighting from shops and offices, and underwater lighting in marinas and on pontoons, has recently been recognized as a cause for marine environmental concern (Davies et al. 2014). Light pollution has been shown to negatively affect the behaviour of several species, and the community composition of marine invertebrates (Davies et al. 2015; Navarro-Barranco & Hughes 2015). Limiting (in duration, intensity or spectral composition), ceasing or prohibiting lighting at night in an area may reduce the levels of light pollution affecting subtidal benthic invertebrates (Gaston et al. 2012).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some subtidal benthic invertebrate species rely on sound to communicate, feed, navigate, detect predators, and reproduce (Popper & Hawkins 2012). Underwater noise, for instance from shipping, fishing, construction work, or aggregate extraction can mask the ambient soundscape and negatively affect subtidal benthic invertebrate species that rely on it (de Soto 2016; Pine et al. 2012; Popper & Hawkins 2012). Reducing underwater noise, for instance by limiting the level, intensity, and duration of specific noise-generating activities, or by using ‘technologies’ to dampen underwater noise emissions (such as bubble curtains, hydro-sound dampeners), may prevent the negative effects on subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for interventions related to noise pollution from sonars are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the use of sonars”.

Background information and definitions:
Some subtidal benthic invertebrate species rely on sound to communicate, feed, navigate, detect predators, and reproduce. Underwater sonar sounds, for instance from naval ships, may be perceived by marine animals as a threat and disturb their anti-predator responses (Abate 2010; Harris et al. 2018). While the threats associated with sonar are so far mainly linked with marine mammals, in contrast little to no research has been undertaken on marine subtidal benthic invertebrates. However, this does not mean the use of sonar does not represent a potential threat to them, particularly as they can be negatively affected by other underwater anthropogenic noise (de Soto 2016; Pine et al. 2012).

2211: Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of cooling effluents from power stations
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some subtidal benthic invertebrate species rely on sound to communicate, feed, navigate, detect predators, and reproduce. Underwater sonar sounds, for instance from naval ships, may be perceived by marine animals as a threat and disturb their anti-predator responses (Abate 2010; Harris et al. 2018). While the threats associated with sonar are so far mainly linked with marine mammals, in contrast little to no research has been undertaken on marine subtidal benthic invertebrates. However, this does not mean the use of sonar does not represent a potential threat to them, particularly as they can be negatively affected by other underwater anthropogenic noise (de Soto 2016; Pine et al. 2012). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the use of sonar underwater could prevent potential unforeseen responses from subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2212: Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of waste effluents overboard from vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Commercial, recreational, industrial, and military vessels can generate large amounts of liquid waste, such as sewage, grey waters, and bilge waters (Welles 2003). Discharge of these wastes overboard from vessels can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area can potentially reduce or stop the source of pollution and allow subtidal benthic invertebrates to recover over time. In many parts of the world, it is illegal to dispose of waste effluents into coastal waters or delimited zones, for instance following local bylaws.
Evidence for interventions related to the discharge of solid wastes overboard are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the discharge of solid waste overboard from vessels”.

2213: Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Antifouling paints and coatings are commonly used to manage biofouling (organisms that can attach to hard surfaces) on aquaculture structures (cages, nets, ponds) and other hard anthropogenic structures. However, some antifouling paints and coatings are highly toxic to marine organisms. Trybutyltin (TBT) for instance was widely used on vessels but found to be highly harmful to marine invertebrates, such as the dog whelk Nucella lapillus (Alzieu 2000; Gibbs et al. 2009) and so the use of this substance was banned (for evidence on the restriction of TBT, see “Threat: Pollution – Restrict the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings”). Using non-toxic antifouling coatings instead of more traditional coatings may reduce the risk of toxicity to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Magin et al. 2010).

2214: Restrict the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Antifouling paints and coatings are commonly used to manage biofouling (organisms that can attach to hard surfaces) on vessels and other hard anthropogenic structures. However, some antifouling paints and coatings are highly harmful and toxic to marine organisms (Roach & Wilson 2009). Trybutyltin (TBT) for instance was widely used on vessels but found to be very harmful to marine invertebrates, such as the dog whelk Nucella lapillus whose females developed male genitals (Alzieu 2000; Gibbs et al. 2009), and a ban on the use of this substance was then instated. Restricting the use of tributyltin or other toxic antifouling coatings can reduce or entirely remove the source of toxicity over time from the seawater, therefore reducing the risk of harm to subtidal benthic invertebrates and allowing populations to recover (Bryan et al. 1993). Related evidence for the use of antifouling coatings are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use non-toxic antifouling coatings on surfaces”.

2215: Remove and clean-up shoreline waste disposal sites
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In parts of the world, such as Antarctica, waste has been dumped in landfill sites (and onto sea ice in Antarctica) for lack of better solutions (Stark et al. 2006). The waste disposal sites can be highly contaminated, and when occurring near the coastal zone can negatively affect marine subtidal benthic invertebrates. Removing and cleaning shoreline waste disposal sites can remove the direct source of pollution and threat, and benefit organisms who may naturally recolonize or recover over time (Stark et al. 2014).

2216: Restore habitats and/or habitat-forming (biogenic) species following extreme events
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Extreme events, such as short periods of unusually high or low temperatures, heavy flooding episodes, or intense storms with heavy rainfall, strong winds and scouring, can profoundly impact the marine environment through alterations in environmental conditions and sediment type (Smale & Wernberg 2013). Extreme events are expected to intensify with on-going climate change (Easterling et al. 2000), with likely negative consequences for subtidal benthic invertebrates. For instance, heat waves and flooding episodes have been associated with declines in benthic communities, including bivalves, crustaceans, and worms in Portugal (Grillo et al. 2011). Restoring habitats and/or habitat-forming (biogenic) species following extreme events may potentially help subtidal benthic invertebrate species recover following the disturbances.
Interventions aimed at restoring habitats and/or habitat-forming species, outside of the context of climate change, are listed in the following chapters: “Species management” and “Habitat restoration and creation”.

2217: Manage climate-driven range extensions of problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Range extensions, where the geographic area occupied by a species naturally (without human interference) changes over time, can occur in response to climate change and extreme events (Kyle et al. 2014; Pitt et al. 2010). In some cases, the ‘new’ species to the area (following range extension) can become problematic and negatively impact on other marine species (Johnson et al. 2011). For instance, the range of the barren-forming sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii has extended poleward from New South Wales to Tasmania over the past 40 years or so, and has been shown to be a contributing factor to the cascading negative ecological effect on the local rocky reef community, shifting from macroalgae-dominated systems to sea urchin barrens (Johnson et al. 2011). Managing climate-driven range extension of these problematic species, for instance through physical removal, may help to alleviate the pressure on subtidal benthic invertebrates.

2219: Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared individuals of habitat-forming (biogenic) species that are resistant to climate change
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many marine species are vulnerable to climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno 2010), but preserving their habitats and promoting biodiversity is thought to help improve the overall resistance of the system and help alleviate the negative effects of climate change.
Transplanting individuals of habitat-forming (biogenic) species (such as kelp, seagrass, mussels, oysters or corals) resistant to climate change can potentially provide a climate-resistant habitat for associated species (van Oppen et al. 2015). These climate-resistant strains or families could be developed for instance through selective breeding or genetic modification (van Oppen et al. 2015). For instance, transplanting individuals of climate-resistant strains of reef-building oysters (Parker et al. 2011) grown in a hatchery may help create an oyster reef that will be resilient to climate change and beneficial to associated subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence related to the transplantation of individuals outside of the context of climate change are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anthropogenic climate change is driven by atmospheric gases, including carbon dioxides (IPCC 2013). Certain marine species and habitats, such as oyster reefs, coral reefs, seagrass beds and macroalgae forests, can act as sinks for the carbon dioxide that gets absorbed in seawater (Dehon 2010; Mcleod et al. 2011). However, many of these carbon-sequestrating species are vulnerable to climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno 2010). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the degradation and/or removal of these carbon sequestering species and habitats may potentially benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates through improved resilience and reduction in carbon dioxide levels.

Anthropogenic climate change is driven by atmospheric gases, including carbon dioxides (IPCC 2013). Many marine species are vulnerable to climate change and likely to be impacted by it in the future (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno 2010). Climate refugia are areas naturally relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time and that can enable the persistence of species and habitats (Keppel et al. 2015; Morelli et al. 2016). Marine protected areas restricting specific impactful activities, or other areas where legal protection or restriction occur, could be created where such refugia occur, to further enhance the refugia effect and promote the persistence and recovery of species facing climate change (Game et al. 2011; Green et al. 2014). Evidence for other interventions related to the creation of marine protected areas is summarised under “Habitat Protection”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Shipping, fishing, and other anthropogenic activities can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage. Specific areas of recognised scientific, ecological, or socio-economic significance can be designated as Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) because of their vulnerability and sensitivity to international maritime activities (IMO Resolution A.982(24); Kachel 2008; Lefebvre-Chalain 2007). Specific management measures can be taken within PSSAs to control for impactful maritime activities, such as ship routeing measures, the strict application of pollution legislation and waste or ballast discharge regulations, or the requirements for specific equipment on ships (Kachel 2008).
       Inside PSSAs, the threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates from specific maritime activities is potentially removed or regulated, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time.
Related evidence linked with shipping regulations and interventions has been summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Shipping lanes”.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities, such as prohibiting all types of fishing (Villamor & Becerro 2012). Such areas are often referred to as marine reserves, marine sanctuaries, or more commonly “no-take areas/zones”. Inside such protected no-take areas, the threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Jack & Wing 2010).
When this intervention occurs outside of a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit all types of fishing”.

Key Messages:

Thirty studies examined the effects of prohibiting all types of fishing in marine protected areas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Four studies were systematic reviews of marine reserves (New Zealand and across the world). Two studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (Bahamas). Five were in the South Pacific Ocean (New Zealand, French Polynesia). Three were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA). Seven were in the Tasman Sea (New Zealand, Australia). One was in the Florida Keys (USA). One was in the Coral Sea (Australia). Three were in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy, Spain). One was in the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea (UK). Two were in the Firth of Clyde (UK). One was in the Foveaux Straight (New Zealand).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (3 studies): Three site comparison studies (one replicated and paired, one replicated, one paired) in the Mediterranean Sea, the Tasman Sea, and the Firth of Clyde found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for five to 16 years depending on the study, had similar combined algae, invertebrate and fish community composition, similar combined mollusc and echinoderm community composition, and similar overall community composition of large invertebrates but different composition of small sessile invertebrates, compared to fished areas.
Overall species richness/diversity (5 studies): One global systematic review, and three site comparison studies (one replicated and paired, one replicated, one paired) in the Mediterranean Sea, the Tasman Sea, and the Firth of Clyde found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for five to 16 years depending on the study, had similar overall invertebrate species richness/diversity, similar combined algae, invertebrate and fish species richness, and similar combined mollusc and echinoderm species richness, compared to fished areas. One site comparison study in the Tasman Sea found inside a marine protected area prohibiting all mobile fishing that macroinvertebrate species richness remained stable over the 15 years after its designation and enforcement, but decreased at fished sites.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (4 studies): Two systematic reviews of marine protected areas across the world prohibiting all fishing found that they had greater overall invertebrate abundance and biomass compared to fished areas. Two site comparison studies (one before-and-after, one replicated) in the Tasman Sea found that inside marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing, overall invertebrate abundance did not change over the 15 years after their designation and enforcement and that it did not change in fished areas either, and that all areas had similar combined mollusc and echinoderm abundance after 16 years.
Overall condition (1 study): One global systematic review found that in marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing, invertebrates were bigger compared to fished areas.
Crustacean abundance (17 studies): Two reviews (one global and systematic, one of New Zealand areas) found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had more lobsters compared to marine protected areas only partially prohibiting fishing and unrestricted fished areas. Eleven of 15 site comparison studies (including replicated, randomized, paired, before-and-after) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea found that inside marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing, the abundances and/or biomasses of lobsters and mud crabs were higher compared to areas where seasonal or unrestricted fishing was allowed, after four to 33 years depending on the study. Four found that they had mixed effects on the abundances of lobster, and crab species, after one to seven years depending on the study. Two found that they had similar abundance of lobsters compared to fished areas after either five to seven years or after approximately 30 years. 
Crustacean reproductive success (4 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated, randomized) in the Florida Keys and the Firth of Clyde found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing and harvesting had similar population sex ratios of lobsters compared to where seasonal fishing or all fishing was allowed, after four to seven years depending on the study. Two replicated, site comparison studies (one randomized) in the Tasman Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had greater lobster egg production potential compared to commercial fishing exclusion zones and fully fished areas, after either 15 years or 21 to 25 years. One site comparison study in the Firth of Clyde found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had more female lobsters with eggs than fished areas, after four to seven years.
Crustacean condition (8 studies): One review of studies in New Zealand, and five of seven site comparison studies (four replicated, one replicated and randomized) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde, the Florida Keys, the South Pacific Ocean, the Coral Sea, and the Tasman Sea, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had bigger lobsters and crabs compared to seasonally fished or fully fished areas, after four to seven years depending on the study. Three found mixed effects on lobsters and crabs depending on species, sex, and locations, after one to seven years depending on the study.
Crustacean population structure (2 studies): Two replicated site comparison studies (one randomized) in the Tasman Sea and the Mediterranean Sea found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had different population size structures of lobsters compared to commercial fishing exclusion zones (only for females) and compared to fished areas, after either 15 years or 21 to 25 years.
Echinoderm abundance (3 studies): Two of three site comparison studies (two replicated, one paired) in the North Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, and the North Pacific Ocean, found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing had similar abundance of Kina sea urchins after more than 10 years, and sea cucumbers after eight years to fished areas, and a third found higher abundance of red sea urchins after approximately 30 years. One also found that the effects on abundance of red sea urchins depended on the age of the protected area and the size of the urchins.
Echinoderm condition (1 study): One paired, site comparison study in the South Pacific Ocean found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for over 10 years had heavier Kina sea urchins compared to fished areas.
Mollusc abundance (10 studies): Four of 10 site comparison studies (including replicated before-and-after, and site comparison) in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean the South Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Foveaux Straight found that inside a marine reserve prohibiting all fishing, abundances/biomass of giant clams, adult queen conch, Cook’s turban snails, rock scallops and green abalone were higher compared to a fished area, after eight to 36 years depending on the study. Six found similar abundances of scallop species, pink abalone, juvenile queen conch, and top shell species, after five to 36 years depending on the study. Three found lower abundances of star limpets after 23 to 25 years and blacklip abalone after 15 to 16 years. One found that the effects of marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing on the abundance of mussel species compared to a commercial fishing exclusion zone varied with the age and location of the protected areas.
Mollusc reproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that inside a marine protected area that had been prohibiting all fishing for 33 to 36 years, abundance of queen conch larvae was higher compared to an unprotected fished area.
Mollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Pacific Ocean found that in marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing pink abalone were bigger five to 23 years after their designation, compared to fished site.

Description: 
2225: Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit commercial fishing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities, such as commercial fishing (Villamor & Becerro 2012). Inside protected areas where commercial fishing is prohibited, the threat from commercial fishing to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Ley‐Cooper et al. 2014). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities that are allowed (for instance recreational fishing).
When this intervention occurred outside of a marine protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit commercial fishing”. Evidence for interventions related to recreational fishing is summarised under “Threat: Human intrusions and disturbances”. Evidence for other interventions related to fisheries restrictions within marine protected areas is summarised under “Habitat protection”.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Crustacean abundance (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one before-and-after, one site comparison) in the South Pacific Ocean found that after implementing a marine park prohibiting commercial fishing but allowing the recreational harvest of lobsters, lobster abundance inside the park did not increase over the 12 years after implementation, and abundance was similar inside the park and outside where fishing occurred.
Crustacean condition (3 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the South Pacific Ocean found that over the 12 years after implementing a marine park prohibiting commercial fishing but allowing the recreational harvest of lobsters, the biomass of legal-size lobsters inside the park did not increase. One of two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the South Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea found bigger lobsters in an area closed to commercial fishing for an unspecified amount of time compared to a fished area. The second study found that 10 years after implementing a marine park prohibiting commercial fishing but allowing the recreational harvest of lobsters, lobster size was similar inside the park and outside where fishing occurred.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Crustacean behaviour (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that 80% of the lobster population occurring in a protected area (year of designation unspecified) where commercial fishing was prohibited remained in the unfished area, and thus remained protected.

2226: Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit bottom trawling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Mobile fishing gear such as bottom trawls are known to be particularly damaging as they are dragged along/above the seabed, but can be prohibited within an area. Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities, such as bottom trawling (Huvenne et al. 2016). Inside protected areas where bottom trawling is prohibited, the threat from bottom trawling to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Hiddink et al. 2017). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities allowed (for instance commercial potting or recreational fishing).

2227: Designate a Marine Protected Area and install physical barriers to prevent trawling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Some habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows, are particularly vulnerable to trawling gears. Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities (Kelleher 1999). In marine protected areas where trawling is prohibited, physical barriers, such as concrete blocks or other artificial reefs, can be placed to ensure no illegal trawling takes place, as such physical barriers would damage trawl nets (Liu et al. 2011).
When this intervention occurs outside of a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Install physical barriers to prevent illegal trawling”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs”.

2228: Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit dredging
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Mobile fishing gear such as towed dredges,  involve towing a heavy steel frame along the bottom of the seabed, and as such are known to be particularly damaging. They are used for instance in the harvest of bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams, scallops). Recreational and artisanal bivalve fishing may cause less impact due to the smaller scale of the operations and different harvesting methods used (for instance hand-harvest). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control scallop dredging (Blyth et al. 2002; Boulcott et al. 2014). Inside protected areas where dredging is prohibited, the threat from dredging to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Blyth et al. 2004). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities allowed (for instance commercial potting or recreational fishing).
Evidence for related intervention is summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit the harvest of scallops”, “Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit all towed (mobile) fishing gear” and “Species management – Cease or prohibit the harvest of scallops”. When this intervention occurred outside of a marine protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit dredging”.

Description: 
2230: Designate a Marine Protected Area with a zonation system of activity restrictions
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fishing and other anthropogenic activities can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage, for example from gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities, such as commercial, recreational, or artisanal fishing (Villamor & Becerro 2012), or restricting specific gear or practices. Some protected areas are designed with a zonation system, whereby specific areas are designed as “no-take zones” prohibiting all fishing and activities, others within the same protected area are designated as “refuge” or “restricted” zones and restrictions vary (some activities are allowed), and even “general use” or “buffer” zones whereby nearly all activities are allowed. This type of marine protected area design is fairly common in certain areas, such as in the Mediterranean Sea (Francour et al. 2001).
Inside protected areas with a zonation system, levels of restriction can benefit previously impacted populations which are, in theory, able to recover over time and can even spill-over from the most protected zones into the less protected zones (Hoskin et al. 2011). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities allowed (for instance recreational fishing).
Evidence for related interventions on fishing restrictions within marine protected areas is summarised under “Habitat protection”.

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies examined the effects of designating a marine protected area with a zonation system of activity restrictions on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Four studies were in the Caribbean Sea (Belize, Mexico), three in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy), one in the Central Pacific Ocean (Ecuador), three in the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea (UK), one in the Indian Ocean (Australia), and one in the North Atlantic Ocean (Portugal).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the combined invertebrate and algae species community composition was different at a site prohibiting all fishing compared to sites where some fishing occurs, after six years.
Overall species richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, sites prohibiting nearly all fishing had similar invertebrate species richness to sites where fishing was mostly allowed, after two years.

POPULATION RESPONSE (13 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, abundances of specific invertebrate groups varied between sites prohibiting nearly all fishing and sites where fishing was mostly allowed, after two years.
Crustacean abundance (7 studies): Three of seven site comparison studies (two replicated) in the Caribbean Sea, the Central Pacific Ocean, and in the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, abundance and/or biomass of spiny lobsters increased in a zone closed to all/commercial fishing and were greater than in a zone where fewer fishing restrictions occurred, after four to 20 years depending on the study. One found that sites closed to all fishing had higher abundances of spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters after eight to ten years compared to fished sites. Two found that sites closed to all fishing for six to seven years had more European lobsters than sites where potting was allowed. And one found that abundances of European lobsters, velvet crabs, brown crabs and spider crabs, after one to four years, varied with the levels of protection.
Crustacean condition (4 studies): Three of five site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Bristol Channel and the Irish Sea, and in the Caribbean Sea found that, inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, sites prohibiting all fishing for seven years or commercial fishing (duration unspecified) had bigger lobsters compared to fished areas. One found that the sizes of lobsters, velvet crabs, brown crabs and spider crabs varied with the levels of protection, and one study found that the size of spiny lobsters decreased similarly in an area prohibiting all fishing and in an area with fewer restrictions 14 to 20 years after designation of the protected area. Two studies undertaken in the same area found conflicting effects of prohibiting all fishing for six to seven years on disease and injury of lobsters.
Echinoderm abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, at a site prohibiting all fishing for 17 to 18 years, abundances of two species of sea urchins were higher than at sites allowing the recreational fishing of purple sea urchins. The other one found similar abundance of purple sea urchins inside fully protected sites, sites where some restricted urchin harvest occurs, and unprotected fished sites outside the protected area after five years.
Echinoderm condition (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, sites prohibiting all fishing had bigger sea urchins compared to sites where some restricted urchin harvest occurs and compared to unprotected fished sites outside the protected area, after either four years or 17 to 18 years.
Mollusc abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the Indian Ocean found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, abundance of blacklip abalone was higher in sites that had been prohibiting all fishing for five years compared to those prohibiting commercial fishing only. Two site comparison studies in the Caribbean Sea found that inside marine protected areas with a zonation system, abundances of adult queen conch increased over time in a zone closed to all fishing and were greater than in zones with fewer restrictions, but abundances of juvenile conch did not differ or vary differently between zones, after either five to eight years or 14 to 20 years.
Mollusc condition (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the size of queen conch decreased similarly in the area prohibiting all fishing and in the area with fewer restrictions, after 14 to 20 years.
Sponge abundance (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea found that inside a marine protected area with a zonation system, the cover of sponges Cliona was higher at a site prohibiting all fishing for six years compared to sites where some fishing occurred.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Crustacean behaviour (1 study): One site comparison study in the Caribbean Sea found that, inside a marine protected area with a zonation system (year of designation unspecified), 80% of the lobster population occurring in the unfished area remained in the protected unfished area, and thus remained protected.

Static fishing gear such as pots and traps, although usually considered less impactful than mobile gears, can be locally damaging to the seabed and subtidal benthic invertebrates directly located under or in their vicinity. Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for static gear (Blyth et al. 2002). Inside protected areas where static gear is prohibited, the threat from these practices to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Blyth et al. 2004). However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities allowed (for instance recreational fishing).
Evidence related to similar intervention outside of a protected area are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit static fishing gears”.

2232: Designate a Marine Protected Area and limit the density of traps
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Traps or pots are often used to fish for crabs or lobsters and consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels which encourage entry, but limit escape. Specific areas can be designated as protected, in which the density of traps is limited (Acheson 1998; Miller 1976). Inside protected areas where the density of traps is limited, the threat from these practices to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time. However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other fishing activities allowed (for instance mobile fishing gears).

2233: Designate a Marine Protected Area and only allow hook and line fishing
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
‘Hook and line’ fishing is a term used for a range of fishing methods that use short fishing lines with hooks. Hook and line fishing is more selective than other types of fishing and has little impact on the seabed. In addition, bycatch species can often be returned to the sea alive because the lines are only in place for a short time. These methods also reduce the direct contact with the seabed, any unintentional physical harm and disturbances, and reduce the amount of bycatch. Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for fishing gears. Inside protected areas where only hook and line fishing is allowed, the threat from these practices to subtidal benthic invertebrates is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time.
When this intervention occurred outside of a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Use hook and line fishing instead of other fishing methods”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anchoring of boats (and other vessels) can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage from anchors and chains (Griffith et al. 2017). Structurally complex seabed habitats, such as seagrass and mussel beds, or oyster and coral reefs, are considered particularly at risk from recreational anchoring (Hammerstrom et al. 2007). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities such as anchoring (Axelson et al. 2012). Setting a no-anchoring zone(s) in marine protected areas can help reduce anchoring-related pressures on subtidal benthic invertebrates, potentially allowing them to naturally recover over time. However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other allowed activities.
Evidence related to similar intervention outside of a protected area are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Set limits or reduce the area where ships can anchor”.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Sea urchins can represent key species within a marine system, with other species crucially depending on their presence to thrive (Coyer et al. 1993; Day & Branch 2002) and to retain balance in the ecosystem (Blamey et al. 2014). Commercial, but also recreational, harvest of edible sea urchins has led to significant ecological changes, not only for sea urchin populations, but also for other species suffering from secondary negative consequences (i.e. a ripple effect; for instance, urchin harvest can negatively affect protected species of abalone; Rogers-Bennett & Pearse 2001). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to prohibit the harvest of sea urchins (Béné & Tewfik 2003; Stoner et al. 2012).
Inside protected areas where this activity is prohibited, the threat from sea urchin harvesting to urchin populations and associated communities is removed, and previously impacted populations are, in theory, able to recover over time (Stoner et al. 2012).

Specific areas can be designated as protected, but often these are set without any clear management measures or usage restrictions in place, or enough enforcement (Guidetti et al. 2008). Inside such protected areas, it is unclear which activities and pressures are taking place, and if subtidal benthic invertebrates are able to naturally recover. While such areas, often referred to as “paper parks” (Rife et al. 2013), do exist, they are not recommended by the scientific community, and it is advised to always set clear management plans, objectives, and enforcement for marine protected areas (Di Minin & Toivonen 2015; Jones & De Santo 2016; Rife et al. 2013).

2242: Establish community-based fisheries management
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Community-based fisheries management, sometimes referred to as indigenous customary management (Twist et al. 2016), assigns the management of marine resources to the local community who often possesses traditional and local knowledge crucial to local management. Community-based fisheries management is often based on a partial protection strategy, which uses one or more spatial management measures (for instance measures that restrict some aspect of the fishery; Cinner & Aswani 2007). Community-based management gives local communities the power to set regional fisheries bylaws and/or regulations and has been implemented into legislation in several countries (Ruddle 1998). By regulating and limiting fishing effort, and protecting the marine environment, community-based fisheries management can, in theory, reduce the impacts on the seabed, the amount of bycatch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Twist et al. 2016).
Evidence for related intervention is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Establish territorial user rights for fisheries”.

Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to control for impactful activities (Kelleher 1999). Engaging with stakeholders when designing protected or closed areas may empower resource users and lead to greater uptake, as well as minimising the social and economic effects of closing fishing grounds.

2244: Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine biogenic habitats are habitats created by the occurrence of a suite of specific marine species that form a new complex environment for other species to live in and can locally promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity. Such habitats include coral reefs, oyster reefs, mussel beds, and kelp forests (Jones et al. 1994). Restoring these habitats where they have been either degraded or lost can be achieved by transplanting new individuals of the biogenic species, for instance from captive-bred or hatchery-reared stock (McCay et al. 2003; Yap 2009). This technique can also be used to create new biogenic habitats where they do not naturally occur (Brumbaugh & Coen 2009). Transplanting biogenic species can promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity by providing additional habitat for species to colonize (Homziak et al. 1982).
Note that here, data on associate invertebrates are reported, but not on the transplanted species itself, which are reported in “Species management - Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Related evidence from translocating studies of habitat-forming species are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Translocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Other related evidence on biogenic habitat restoration is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Restore biogenic habitats (other methods)”.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine biogenic habitats are habitats created by the occurrence of a suite of specific marine species that form a new complex environment for other species to live in, and which can locally promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity. Such habitats include coral reefs, oyster reefs, mussel beds, and kelp forests (Jones et al. 1994). Restoring these habitats where they have been either degraded or lost can be achieved by translocating new individuals of the biogenic species naturally occurring elsewhere, for instance from another healthy non-degraded site (Fariñas-Franco & Roberts 2014; Hughes et al. 2008). This technique can also be used to create new biogenic habitats where they do not naturally occur (Nelson et al. 2004).
Note that here, data on associated invertebrates are reported, but not on the translocated species itself, which are reported in “Species management – Translocate species”. However, as the outcomes of translocating biogenic species can vary largely with the species and habitat that they form, studies have been grouped by habitat and/or wider taxonomic group (e.g: reefs or beds formed by molluscs such as oysters, mussels, snails; meadows made by seagrass; forests made by kelp; or reefs made by corals). Evidence from transplantation studies from hatchery-reared biogenic species are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Transplant habitat-forming (biogenic) species” and under “Species management – Transplant/release captive-bred or hatchery-reared species”.

Two studies examined the effects of translocating habitat-forming molluscs on associated subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. Both were in Strangford Lough (UK).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Strangford Lough found that plots with translocated mussels had different associated invertebrate communities to plots without mussels, but also to natural mussel beds. One replicated, controlled study in Strangford Lough found that translocating mussels onto scallop shells or directly onto the seabed led to similar associated invertebrate communities.
Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Strangford Lough found that plots with translocated mussels had higher richness and diversity of associated invertebrates to plots without mussels, and similar to natural mussel beds. One replicated, controlled study in Strangford Lough found that translocating mussels onto scallop shells or directly onto the seabed led to similar richness and diversity of associated invertebrates.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in Strangford Lough presented unclear abundance results. One replicated, controlled study in Strangford Lough found that translocating mussels onto scallop shells or directly onto the seabed led to higher abundance of associated invertebrates in one of two comparisons.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (2 studies): One replicated, controlled study in Strangford Lough found that after restoring beds of horse mussels by adding scallop shells to the seabed, overall invertebrate community composition in restored plots was different to that of unrestored plots.

Key Messages:

Eight studies examined the effects of restoring oyster reefs (not by transplanting or translocating oysters) on oysters and oyster reef-associated subtidal benthic invertebrates. Two were in the Gulf of Mexico (USA), one was a global review, four were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), and one was in the Mission-Aransas estuary (USA).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mission-Aransas estuary found that after restoring eastern oyster reefs, the community composition of combined mobile decapod invertebrates and fish was similar on all types of restoration material used, but the other found that composition varied with the material used.
Overall species richness/diversity (3 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Gulf of Mexico found that diversity of reef-associated invertebrates was similar in reefs restored by laying rocks regardless of age, in young reefs restored by laying oyster shells, and in natural reefs, but lower in old shell-restored reefs. One replicated, controlled study in the Gulf of Mexico found that diversity of reef-associated invertebrates was higher in all restored reefs than on unrestored sediment, but that diversity varied between the restoration materials used. One replicated, controlled study in the Mission-Aransas estuary found that diversity of fish, crabs and shrimps varied with the restoration material used.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (2 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Gulf of Mexico found that the effect of restoring eastern oyster reefs on the abundance of reef-associated invertebrates depended on the material used for restoration and the age of the reef. One replicated, controlled study in the Gulf of Mexico found that abundance of combined reef-associated mobile decapod invertebrate and fish was similar on all restored reefs regardless of the restoration material used, and higher than on unrestored sediment.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the Mission-Aransas estuary found that after restoring eastern oyster reefs, crab abundance, but not biomass, and shrimp biomass, but not abundance, varied with the restoration material used.
Oyster abundance (6 studies): One replicated, site comparison study in the Gulf of Mexico found that oyster reefs restored by laying rocks had similar oyster abundance to natural reefs, and higher than reefs restored by laying oyster shells. One replicated, controlled study in the Mission-Aransas estuary found that oyster cover and abundance varied with the restoration material used. One replicated, controlled study in the Gulf of Mexico found that oyster spat abundance was similar on all types of restoration material used, and higher than on unrestored sediment. Three replicated, controlled studies in the North Pacific Ocean found that restoring oyster reefs by placing lines of clam shells below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) led to higher cover of clam shells by oysters than when placing the lines above MLLW, that for those placed below MLLW, keeping them there led to similar cover compared to moving them above MLLW halfway through the study, and that placing the lines on cobbly seabed led to similar cover compared to placing them on muddy seabed.
Oyster reproductive success (3 studies): Three replicated, controlled studies in the North Pacific Ocean found that restoring oyster reefs by placing lines of clam shells below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) led to higher recruitment of oyster spat on clam shells than by lacing lines above MLLW, that recruitment was higher on lines placed on cobbly seabed than on muddy seabed, and that recruitment was similar on lines placed near or far from the nearest adult oyster populations.
Oyster survival (5 studies): One global systematic review found that two of nine restoration techniques (restoring oyster reef by transplanting juveniles, and by creating no-harvest sanctuaries) assessed resulted in over 85% survival of restored oysters. Four replicated, controlled studies in the North Pacific Ocean found that restoring oyster reefs by placing lines of clam shells below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) led to similar survival of oysters than when placing the lines above MLLW, but that for those placed below MLLW, moving them above MLLW halfway through the study led to higher survival than keeping then below, that survival was similar on lines placed on cobbly seabed or muddy seabed, and that survival was similar on lines placed near or far from the nearest adult oyster populations.
Oyster condition (5 studies): One replicated, controlled study in the Gulf of Mexico found that the effect of restoring eastern oyster reefs on average spat size varied with the restoration material used. One replicated, controlled study in the North Pacific Ocean found that restoring oyster reefs by placing lines of clam shells below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) led to similar growth of oysters on the shells than placing lines above MLLW. Four replicated, controlled studies in the North Pacific Ocean found that restoring oyster reefs by placing lines of clam shells below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) led to higher cover of clam shells by non-native species than placing lines above MLLW, but that for those placed below MLLW, moving them above MLLW halfway through the study led to lower cover than keeping then below, that cover was similar on lines placed on cobbly seabed or muddy seabed, and that cover of clam shells by non-native species was higher on lines placed near compared to far from the nearest adult oyster populations.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (1 study): One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the Florida Keys found that restoring seagrass beds by fertilizing the seabed had no effect on overall invertebrate community composition, but adding sand led to communities different from both unrestored and natural sites.
Overall species richness/diversity (2 studies): One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the Florida Keys found that after restoring seagrass beds by fertilizing the seabed and adding sand, overall invertebrate species richness was similar at restored, unrestored, and natural sites. One replicated, controlled study in the Indian Ocean found that transplanting plastic seagrass mimics into bare sites, previously-restored seagrass sites, and natural seagrass sites, resulted in similar invertebrate diversity on mimic leaves and in the surrounding sediment, and similar species richness on mimic leaves at all restored sites as on natural seagrass leaves.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after restoring seagrass beds, the abundance of mobile invertebrates had increased and was higher in restored than unrestored plots, but the abundance of sessile invertebrates had not increased. One replicated, controlled study in the Indian Ocean found that transplanting plastic seagrass mimics into bare sites, previously-restored seagrass sites, and natural seagrass sites, resulted in similar abundance of invertebrate in the surrounding sediment across sites, and resulted in different abundance of invertebrates on mimic leaves between sites although all had lower abundances than on natural seagrass leaves. One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the Florida Keys found that after restoring seagrass beds by fertilizing the seabed or adding sand, overall invertebrate abundance was not different at restored sites compared to both unrestored and natural sites.

2250: Restore coastal lagoons
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coastal lagoons (areas of shallow, coastal salt water, wholly or partially separated from the sea by sandbanks, shingle or, less frequently, rocks) are highly biodiverse systems. They can also be connected to land water through rivers, and as such host both marine, brackish, and freshwater invertebrate species. However, coastal lagoons are highly threatened by eutrophication, pollution, urbanization, and diverse forms of modification in their watersheds, caused by high levels of human activity in the coastal zones of all continents (Esteves et al. 2008), resulting in biodiversity loss. Coastal lagoons could be restored through various means, including re-salination, hydrological modifications and algae harvesting (Ghosh et al. 2006; Lenzi et al. 2003). Restoring coastal lagoons can potentially help promote local biodiversity and recover lost or declining species of subtidal benthic invertebrates (Mohapatra et al. 2007).

2251: Refill disused borrow pits
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
'Aggregates’ is the collective term for sand, gravel and crushed rock. They are used as raw materials for the construction industry as well as for beach replenishment schemes (De Groot 1996). Extraction leads to physical impacts and disruption of the seabed, including the formation of borrow pits, also known as dredged holes (Reine et al. 2013). Borrow pits tend to be very different from the surrounding natural seabed, being much deeper, isolated, and of different sediment type. The natural seabed ecology could be restored by refilling the disused borrow pits following cessation of extraction (Reine et al. 2013). This can potentially help the recolonization and natural recovery of the invertebrate community.
Evidence for interventions related to aggregate extraction is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Mining and quarrying”.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitats and invertebrate populations within many ports, harbours, and docks around the world have deteriorated due to anthropogenic pressures, such as pollution and eutrophication, and the consequent decline in water quality and oxygenation (Russell et al. 1983). Improving water quality to these environments, for instance by increasing water mixing and oxygenation, can be achieved by installing a pump underwater. Installing a pump can help increase oxygen concentration in seawater, improve overall water quality, and potentially help promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity (Russell et al. 1983; Yamochi & Oda 2002).

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Landscaping or artificial enhancement can be undertaken as a restoration method aimed to promote the recovery and recolonization processes of subtidal benthic invertebrates. This could also constitute a pre-restoration method to improve the seabed and potentially enhance further restoration. For instance, following cessation of marine aggregate extraction, to try recreating the natural substrate, a layer of gravel or shell can be added to the seabed or the sediment can be landscaped (Cooper et al. 2011; de Jong et al. 2015). Broken limestone rubble or empty shellfish shells have also been laid on the seabed to enhance the natural habitat and enhance recolonization of natural biodiversity (Fariñas-Franco et al. 2013; Jones & Nithyanandan 2013; Meyer & Townsend 2000).

Overall community composition (2 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea found that following addition of gravels, invertebrate community composition became more similar to natural seabed communities. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in invertebrate community composition following addition of sedimentary dredge material.
Overall richness/diversity (3 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea and one site comparison study in the Persian Gulf found that invertebrate species richness increased following addition of gravels or coral and limestone rubbles, and one also found that richness became similar to natural seabed. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in species richness following addition of sedimentary dredged material.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): One controlled, before-and after study in the North Sea and one site comparison study in the Persian Gulf found that invertebrate abundance and biomass increased following addition of gravels or coral and limestone rubbles, and one also found that abundance became similar to natural seabed. One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Westerschelde estuary found no change in invertebrate abundance and biomass following addition of sedimentary dredge material.

2254: Use green engineering techniques on artificial structures - Modify rock dump to make it more similar to natural substrate
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Artificial structures are proliferating in the marine environment, with wide-scale negative impacts for biodiversity (Ido & Shimrit 2015). Green engineering, also referred to as “eco-engineering”, aims at mitigating the negative ecological impacts of artificial structures, and maximising their potential positive outcomes (Dafforn et al. 2015; Firth et al. 2014; Ido & Shimrit 2015). Green-engineering techniques include the use of natural or eco-friendly materials, such as wood, shell, rock, the addition of structural features (rockpools, crevices, ridges) or the seeding of native habitat-forming (biogenic) species, onto artificial structures (Dafforn et al. 2015; Firth et al. 2014).
Subsea cables and rock dump (used to stabilise and protect underwater structures, such as oil and gas platforms, as well as subsea cables and pipelines) can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage, loss of natural sediment and changes in habitat characteristics. Modifying rock dump (either before or after deployment) to make it as similar as possible to natural hard substrates, such as bedrock or rocky reef, can potentially provide suitable replacement habitat for subtidal benthic invertebrate species commonly found in the area. In addition, subsea cables and pipelines could be covered with artificial reefs, or with materials that encourage the accumulation of natural sediment, to potentially promote colonisation by subtidal benthic invertebrates associated with natural hard rocky seabed or natural soft sediments, and enhance local biodiversity.
       Evidence for other interventions related to rock dumping and offshore industries are summarised in the following chapters: “Threat: Energy production and mining” and “Threat: Transportation and service corridors”. Evidence for other interventions related to subsea cables and pipelines are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Bury pipelines instead of surface laying and rock dumping”, and “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Bury cables and pipelines in the seabed rather than laying them on the seabed” and “Remove utility and service lines after decommissioning”.

2257: Provide artificial shelters
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, such as habitat loss (Airoldi et al. 2008). To improve animals’ survival or recolonization success, some assistance can be provided in the form of artificial shelters that mimic the natural shelters usually found in the marine environment, such as ‘casitas’ used for lobsters (Gutzler et al. 2015). These shelters can provide refugia and potentially help animals avoid predation (Arce et al. 1997).

2258: Create artificial reefs
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Artificial reefs are man-made structures intentionally introduced into the marine environment and aimed to act similarly to natural reefs. Originally used to improve biological resources, they may also increase other local biodiversity (Bohnsack & Sutherland 1985; Clark & Edwards 1999). Creating an artificial reef in an area can potentially help increase subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity by creating additional suitable habitat for them.
Evidence comparing artificial reefs of different typologies (material used and/or 3-D structures) is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs of different 3-D structure and material used”. When artificial reefs are created as an offset strategy, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Offset habitat loss from human activity by restoring or creating habitats elsewhere”.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Overall community composition (3 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the English Channel and North Atlantic Ocean found that invertebrate communities growing on artificial reefs were different to that of natural reefs. One replicated study the North Pacific Ocean found that invertebrate community composition changed over time on an artificial reef.
Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean found that invertebrate species richness and/or diversity on the artificial reef or in the sediments inside and adjacent to the reef area were lower compared to on natural reefs or in nearby natural sediments. One replicated, site comparison study in the Gulf of Mexico found that artificial breakwaters had more species of nekton compared to adjacent mudflats. One site comparison study in English Channel recorded 263 taxa on the artificial reef, including at least nine not recorded on nearby natural reefs but excluding at least 39 recorded on natural reefs. One replicated study in the North Pacific Ocean found a 49% increase in species richness over five years on an artificial reef. One study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that artificial reefs hosted at least five species of large mobile invertebrates.
Mollusc richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea found that mollusc species richness and diversity were lower on artificial reefs compared to natural reefs.
Worm community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the North Pacific Ocean found that polychaete worm community composition was similar at one of two artificial reefs compared to a natural reef.
Worm richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the North Pacific Ocean found that polychaete worm species richness and diversity were similar at one of two artificial reefs compared to a natural reef, but lower at the second artificial reef.

POPULATION RESPONSE (12 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (10 studies): One of two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Mediterranean Sea found that abundance of invertebrates in the sediment was lower at the reef sites than in nearby natural sediments, but increased in the sediments directly adjacent to the reefs, while the other study found that abundance was similar in the sediments inside and directly adjacent to the artificial reef area, but lower than in nearby natural sediments. Of five site comparison studies (four replicated) in the North Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Yellow Sea, one found that invertebrate biomass was higher on the artificial reef than in adjacent natural sediments, two that invertebrate abundance and biomass and nekton abundance were similar on artificial reefs and natural habitats (reef; mudflat), and two found mixed effects on abundances of invertebrates. One site comparison study in the English Channel reported that the abundances of some species were lower on the artificial reef compared to natural reefs. One replicated study in the North Pacific Ocean reported an 86% increase in invertebrate abundance growing on an artificial reef over five years. One study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that two of five species at one artificial reef, and three of seven at another, were recorded during &gt;50% of dives.
Overall condition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Yellow Sea found mixed effects of creating an artificial reef on the sizes of mobile invertebrates.
Mollusc abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea found that mollusc abundance was lower on artificial reefs compared to natural reefs.
Crustacean abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison in the Firth of Lorn found that abundances of edible crabs and velvet swimming crabs were typically higher on artificial than natural reefs.

2259: Create artificial reefs of different 3-D structure and material used
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Artificial reefs are man-made structures intentionally put into the marine environment to act similarly to a natural reef. Originally used to improve fisheries and biological resources, they have been shown to be ecologically beneficial by locally increasing biodiversity (Bohnsack & Sutherland 1985; Clark & Edwards 1999). Various construction material and architectural arrangements can be used when creating an artificial reef to manipulate its 3-D structure and level of complexity, for instance by using pyramidal structures instead of tubes, or using “sea-friendly” reinforced concrete instead of traditional common concrete (Ponti et al. 2015; Spagnolo et al. 2014). The architecture and characteristics of the artificial reef can influence which species of subtidal benthic invertebrates colonize the reefs, in what abundances, at what rate, and how long they can survive. The 3-D structure and material used to create an artificial reef can be selected to potentially enhance marine subtidal biodiversity.
Evidence related to creating artificial reefs in general, without considering 3-D structures or construction material, is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs”.

Overall richness/diversity (5 studies): Four controlled studies (three replicated) in the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico found no differences in overall invertebrate richness/diversity or combined mobile invertebrate and fish richness between reef structure and/or material. One controlled study in the Mediterranean Sea found that invertebrate species richness was lower on “sea-friendly” pyramid reefs compared to bundle reefs of traditional concrete.

POPULATION RESPONSE (7 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (5 studies): Four controlled studies (three replicated) in the English Channel, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico found no differences in overall invertebrate abundances or combined mobile invertebrate and fish abundance between reef structure and/or material.

2260: Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient run-offs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial reefs are man-made structures intentionally put into the marine environment to act similarly to a natural reef. Originally used to improve fisheries and biological resources, they have been shown to be ecologically beneficial by locally enhancing biodiversity and increasing abundance (Bohnsack & Sutherland 1985; Clark & Edwards 1999). By locating an artificial reef near an aquaculture system, the introduced reef can potentially benefit from the nutrient-rich run-offs frequently associated with aquaculture systems, thereby promoting the colonisation and development of a subtidal benthic invertebrate community on the reef (Aguado-Giménez et al. 2011).
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to act as biofilters” and “Threat: Energy production and mining – Co-locate aquaculture systems with other activities and infrastructures (such as windfarms)”.

2261: Place anthropogenic installations (e.g: windfarms) in an area such that they create artificial habitat and reduce the level of fishing activity
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anthropogenic installations, such as wind farms, drilling platforms, rigs, can act as artificial reefs, by introducing hard and complex habitats often where the natural habitat is soft sediment (Krone et al. 2017; Langhamer & Wilhelmsson 2009). These installations may have safety zones around them, either temporarily or permanently, to limit, reduce or remove human activities that can take place, such as fishing. While this may be due to the risk of gear loss and snagging when in contact with such installations, it can have secondary conservation benefits by acting as de facto marine reserves (Ashley et al. 2014). By both acting as artificial reefs and reducing the level of fishing activity around them, placing anthropogenic installations in an area can reduce threats to subtidal benthic invertebrates while promoting their recovery.
Related evidence for the effects of creating buffer zones around anthropogenic installations is summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Cease or prohibit shipping”.
Evidence for the co-location of activities and marine spatial planning is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Co-locate aquaculture systems with other activities and infrastructures (such as wind farms) to maximise use of marine space”, “Threat: Pollution – Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to act as biofilters”, and “Habitat restoration and creation – Locate artificial reefs near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient run-offs”. Further evidence related to creating artificial reefs is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Artificial habitat creation”, while evidence related to regulating and mitigation fishing is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use”.

2262: Repurpose obsolete offshore structures to act as artificial reefs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Offshore structures (such as oil rigs and windfarm turbine bases), have been shown to support diverse invertebrate assemblages, and act as artificial reefs (Coates et al. 2014; Krone et al. 2017; Langhamer & Wilhelmsson 2009). For instance, wind turbine foundations in a windfarm in the German Bight, North Sea, were found to host over 5,000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus per foundation (Krone et al. 2017).
Following decommissioning, entire or parts of obsolete offshore structures can potentially be repurposed to act as artificial reefs instead of being removed from the marine environment (Frumkes 2002). By repurposing obsolete offshore structures within the marine environment and leaving them in place or placing them in strategic locations, they can potentially provide additional hard surface for subtidal benthic invertebrates to colonise and seek shelter, and thereby enhance local invertebrate biodiversity (Frumkes 2002; Ponti et al. 2002). This can also benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates by avoiding or reducing the disturbance associated with the removal of these structures from the marine environment.
Evidence for interventions relating to the decommissioning of offshore structures is summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Leave pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning” and “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Leave utility and service lines in place after decommissioning”. Evidence related to artificial reefs is summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Habitat enhancement” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Artificial habitat creation”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Following damages to habitats and natural resources, for instance from pollution or physical disturbances, the guilty parties could be required to pay monetary compensation (Price et al. 2012). Such compensations can be direct monetary ‘fines’ for damages, payments towards the costs of environmental assessments, or reimbursement for remediation, restoration or offsetting actions. For instance, following the massive oil spill of 1991, a multibillion-dollar compensation was paid to several Gulf States for damages and restoration projects (Payne & Sand 2011; Price et al. 2012). Monetary compensation can benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates when used for remediation, restoration or offsetting projects (Jones et al. 2012).
Evidence related to offsetting projects for lost habitats, which can be undertaken through monetary compensation, are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Offset habitat loss from human activity by restoring or creating habitats elsewhere”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of paying monetary compensation for habitat damage remediation on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.

2264: Remove and relocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species before onset of impactful activities
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine biogenic habitats are habitats created by the occurrence of specific marine species, such as coral reefs, oyster reefs, mussel beds, or kelp forests (Jones et al. 1994). They form a new complex environment for other species to live in and can locally promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity. Many populations of marine biogenic species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including habitat damage or loss and direct physical damages from anthropogenic activities (Airoldi et al. 2009). As a pre-emptive conservation measure, biogenic species can potentially be temporarily removed to allow for an impactful activity to occur, then relocated back into their original location, or at a different location. Such measures have been trialled to preserve maërl habitat and its associated faunal community during the dredging of new shipping channels (Sheehan et al. 2015).
When this intervention is undertaken for species which do not form habitats, evidence has been summarised under “Species management – Remove and relocate invertebrate species before onset of impactful activities”.

2265: Offset habitat loss from human activity by restoring or creating habitats elsewhere
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitat restoration and creation interventions can be undertaken at a site as a biodiversity offset strategy to replace the biodiversity lost at an impacted site, with the aim to achieve ‘no net loss’ of overall biodiversity (Ives & Bekessy 2015). Offsetting can be done “in-kind”, where the new habitat is similar to the lost one (for example creating coral reefs to replace lost coral reefs elsewhere), or “out-of-kind”, where the new habitat is different to the lost one (for example creating an artificial reef to replace lost mudflats elsewhere; evidence summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Create artificial reefs” and “Create artificial reefs of different 3-D structure and material used”). When offsetting is undertaken in the marine and coastal environment, it can help promote subtidal benthic invertebrate biodiversity (Jones et al. 2007).

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, such as habitat loss and overharvesting (Airoldi et al. 2008; Hobday et al. 2000). To counteract this phenomenon, captive-bred or hatchery-reared subtidal benthic invertebrates can be transplanted or released at a site, either to introduce a species to a new site (where they did not historically occur), to reintroduce a species to a site (where they used to occur), or to enhance the population at a site where the species is already present by increasing its abundance (Hansen & Gosselin 2013). As the outcomes of transplanting/releasing species can vary largely with the type of species, studies have been grouped by broader taxonomic group (e.g: crustaceans such as lobsters or prawns; or molluscs such as abalone, scallops, or mussels).
Here, only direct transplanting/releasing methods have been considered, without added interventions or changes to the methods to improve survival after release. However, when transplant/release was undertaken in predator exclusion cages, evidence has been summarised under “Species management – Transplant/release captive-bred or hatchery-reared species in predator exclusion cages”.
       When transplanting hatchery-reared individuals is undertaken for a habitat-forming species, effects on the invertebrates associated with the habitat are reported in “Habitat restoration and creation – Transplant captive-bred or hatchery-reared habitat-forming (biogenic) species”. Evidence from translocation studies of naturally occurring species is summarised under “Species management – Translocate species” and “Habitat restoration and creation – Translocate habitat-forming (biogenic) species”.

Eight studies examined the effects of transplanting or releasing hatchery-reared mollusc species on their wild populations. One examined abalone in the North Pacific Ocean (Canada), one examined clams off the Strait of Singapore (Singapore), one examined oysters in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA), and four examined scallops in the North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico (USA).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Mollusc abundance (2 studies): One replicated, before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after transplanting hatchery-reared scallops, abundance of juvenile scallops typically increased, but not that of adult scallops. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the North Atlantic Ocean, found that after releasing hatchery-reared oyster larvae, more spat initially settled using a direct technique compared to a traditional remote technique, and equal number of spat settled on cleaned and natural oyster shells.
Mollusc reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after transplanting hatchery-reared scallops, larval recruitment increased across all areas studied.
Mollusc survival (5 studies): One replicated study in the Strait of Singapore found that, after transplantation in the field, aquarium-reared clams had a high survival rate. One replicated, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after transplanting hatchery-reared scallops, the number of transplanted scallops surviving decreased regardless of the methods used, and maximum mortalities was reported to be 0–1.5%. One replicated, controlled study in the North Pacific Ocean found that transplanting hatchery-reared abalone into the wild reduced survivorship compared to non-transplanted hatchery-reared abalone kept in tanks. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after releasing hatchery-reared oyster larvae, 61% of the settled spat survived the winter, and settled spat survived equally on cleaned and natural oyster shells.
Mollusc condition (3 studies): Two replicated studies in the Strait of Singapore and the North Atlantic Ocean found after transplantation in the wild, aquarium-reared clams and hatchery-reared scallops increased in weight and/or grew. Scallops grew in both free-planted plots and suspended bags but grew more in free-planted plots. One replicated, before-and-after study in the Gulf of Mexico found that after transplanting hatchery-reared scallops, wild populations had not become genetically more similar to hatchery-reared scallops. One replicated, controlled study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that after transplanting hatchery-reared scallops, free-planted scallops developed less shell biofouling than suspended scallops.

Recreational fishing and harvest quotas (such as Total Allowable Catch) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources (species stocks). Catch quotas are limits, expressed for instance in weight or numbers of animals, that one person or vessel is allowed to fish or harvest over a certain period. Setting catch quotas for specific species, particularly those declining or endangered, can potentially reduce the pressure from fishing and harvesting, and allow the species to recover over time (Lewis 2015).
Related evidence is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set commercial catch quotas”.

2274: Establish size limitations for the capture of recreational species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including overharvest (Hobday et al. 2000). Populations of certain species have decline to such extent that they are now protected (Stierhoff et al. 2012), and their fishing and harvest is controlled, for instance by setting maximum and minimum limits on the size (usually correlated with age) of animals allowed to be caught (Van Poorten et al. 2013). Setting minimum size limits can protect juveniles and animals that have not yet reached sexual maturity, potentially allowing them to reach adulthood and reproduce. Setting maximum size limits can protect older mature animals, which often contribute more strongly to reproduction and population renewal (for instance older females usually produce more or bigger eggs).

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including overharvest (Hobday et al. 2000). Populations of certain species have declined to such extent that they are now protected, and their fishing and harvesting is controlled and/or illegal (Stierhoff et al. 2012). For species for which fishing or harvesting is forbidden, animals can be tagged to deter illegal capture and potentially help reduce their population declines (Lewis 2015).
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set commercial catch quotas”, and “Species management – Set recreational catch quotas” and “Etablish size limitations for the capture of recreational species”.

2277: Cease or prohibit the harvesting of scallops
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Commercial harvesting of scallops is usually undertaken using dredges, and as such can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through removal of untargeted species and damage to the seabed. Recreational and artisanal scallop fishing may cause less impact due to the smaller scale of the operations and the harvesting methods used (for instance hand-harvest). Nevertheless, both harvesting methods have negative consequences on scallop populations, particularly if harvesting levels are unsustainable. Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvesting of scallops in an area, potentially allowing scallop populations to recover over time (Bull 1989; Schejter et al. 2008).
When this intervention occurs within a protected area, evidence has been summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and cease or prohibit harvesting of scallops”. Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Cease or prohibit scallops dredging” and “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit dredging”.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conch populations have significantly declined due to overharvest, for commercial and recreational purposes (Theile 2001). Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvest of conch in an area, in order to reduce the pressure on conch populations and in theory allow the population to recovery naturally.

2279: Cease or prohibit the harvest of sea urchins
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sea urchins can represent key species within a marine system, with other species crucially depending on their presence to thrive (Coyer et al. 1993). Commercial, but also recreational, harvest of edible sea urchins has led to significant changes, with for instance species of protected abalones suffering as a ripple effect (Rogers-Bennett & Pearse 2001). Bylaws, legislation, or voluntary agreements could be established which prohibit the harvest of sea urchins in an area, in theory allowing their population to recover, and as a consequence the wider subtidal benthic invertebrate communities which depend on them (Rogers-Bennett & Pearse 2001).
When this intervention occurs in a marine protected area, the evidence is summarised under “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and prohibit harvest of sea urchins”.

2280: Remove and relocate invertebrate species before onset of impactful activities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are under, including habitat damage or loss and direct physical damages from anthropogenic activities (Airoldi et al. 2008; Hobday et al. 2000). As a pre-emptive conservation measure, species can be temporarily removed to allow for an impactful activity to occur, then relocated back into their original location, or at a different location. Such measure has been trialled to preserve maërl (rhodolith) species and the habitat it forms during the dredging of new shipping channels (Sheehan et al. 2015; see “Habitat restoration and creation – Remove and relocate habitat-forming (biogenic) invertebrate species before onset of impactful activities”).

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Whether through school curricula, education programmes, training courses, workshops, or outreach events, providing education and training programmes can help raise awareness about marine conservation issues and potentially induce a behavioural change (Colleton et al. 2016; Kwan et al. 2017; Leisher et al. 2012). These programmes may be about the marine environment in general or about specific ecosystems, species, or groups of species, their biodiversity, conservation, and management.

2282: Organise educational marine wildlife tours to improve behaviours towards marine invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine wildlife tours can be highly educational for visitors and provide conservation benefits (Zeppel & Muloin 2008). This has in part been linked to emotional and affective responses. Visitors can also learn about the biology, ecology, and behaviour of marine species; best practice guidelines; and human threats to marine life, during educational marine wildlife tours. Studies have shown that visitors who attended the tours wanted to be educated about marine issues (Lück 2003). Such tours have been linked to behavioural and intentional changes, increased empathy towards marine wildlife and increased engagement in marine conservation actions (Zeppel 2008).
