3397: Sow grass seeds
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Grass seeds are often sown following infrastructure development or in highly degraded land to reduce soil erosion or colonisation by weeds (Deák et al. 2011). In some cases, grasses sown include non-native species, as the aim of sowing is often to improve vegetation cover rather than native biodiversity. However, sowing grass seeds may increase the likelihood that other grassland species will colonise a site.

Key Messages:

Thirteen studies examined the effects of sowing grass seeds on grassland vegetation. Six studies were in North America, five studies were in Europe and one study was in each of Canada and South Africa.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (6 STUDIES)

Community composition (2 studies): One of two paired studies (one of which was replicated, randomized and controlled) in Hungary and the UK found that, over time, plant communities in areas where grass seeds were sown and in areas where no seeds were sown became more similar to those of intact grasslands. The other study found that plant communities in sown areas were different from those of ancient grasslands or sites where natural regeneration was allowed.
Overall richness/diversity (4 studies): Three of four studies (three of which were replicated and controlled, and one of which was a site comparison) in the UK, Hungary, Iceland and the USA found that sowing grass seeds did not change or reduced overall plant species richness. The other study found that species richness was lower than that found in nearby intact prairies.

3400: Sow grassland seeds from a local source
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many restoration projects sow seeds harvested from local intact grassland sites rather than using seeds bought from seed suppliers. In some cases, this is done to obtain a mix of species that is more similar to natural grasslands. In other cases, it is done because seeds obtained locally may be better adapted to local environmental conditions, such as local soils and climate.

3401: Sow seeds of nurse plants
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Nurse plants are plants which are thought to aid the growth of other species by providing relatively benign conditions below their canopy. Examples of these altered conditions may include increases in moisture and nutrients, and decreases in temperature and damage from herbivores (de Toledo Castanho & Prado 2014). Sowing the seeds of nurse plants may facilitate the colonisation of grassland species.
This action involves sowing the seeds of nurse plants only. For studies that sow or plant both nurse plants and grassland plant species, see ‘Sow or plant nurse plants (alongside seeding/planting of grassland species)’.

3407: Sow seeds at start of growing season
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Grassland seeds are commonly sown in autumn or spring in restoration projects in temperate regions. Sowing in autumn may result in early germination of plants allowing them to become established before other non-grassland species. However, sowing in autumn may also result in more seeds dying as a result of waterlogging in winter and so, in some cases, spring sowing may produce better results.

Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Seeds may be sown within gaps (sometimes referred to as ‘establishment gaps’) created within existing grassland. Gaps are prepared prior to sowing by breaking up the grass sward and disturbing the soil, e.g. by digging. The aim is to reduce competition by resident grasses and provide optimal conditions for the establishment of sown target grassland species. This may be particularly beneficial within dense species-poor grasslands.

Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Seed-drilling is the sowing of seeds in uniform rows to a standard soil depth (Bufton 1978). This is usually done with the aid of specialized machinery called a seed drill. Sowing at depth rather than sowing seeds by hand on the soil’s surface may reduce seed removal by seed predators, such as birds. Rolling after sowing with seed drills may allow light to reach seeds to allow germination.

3412: Spray slurry of seed, mulch and water (‘hydroseeding’)
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Hydroseeding is a method of sowing seeds that involves spraying a slurry of seed, mulch and water over an area. Often an adhesive is added to fix the mulch and seeds onto slopes to prevent erosion. Fertilizer is also sometimes added to this mix. It is often used following construction of roads or dikes to increase vegetation cover and prevent soil erosion. The method is potentially useful in arid areas as added mulch retains moisture, potentially facilitating germination and colonization by grassland plants.

3414: Remove leaf litter before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Traditional management of grasslands, such as mowing and grazing, can help to prevent a build-up of plant litter. However, many grasslands have been abandoned leading to accumulation of litter which may reduce the growth and germination of some grassland plants. Removing this litter may, consequently, aid growth and germination of grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of removing leaf litter before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot with leaf litter left in place). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

3415: Remove topsoil or turf before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Conversion of grasslands to arable agriculture or pasture often leads to soils with high nutrient content. These high nutrient content soils promote the growth of grass species which can outcompete forb species. In addition, these soils may contain seeds of undesirable plants (e.g. crop seeds). Removing topsoil may help to reduce soil nutrient content as well as eliminating the seeds of undesirable species. Sowing seeds after the removal of topsoil may aid colonisation by grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of removing topsoil/turf before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot with topsoil/turf left in place). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

3418: Apply herbicide before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many degraded grasslands have few species and are dominated by grasses. In order to restore species-rich grasslands, herbicide may be applied to kill any vegetation that is present. Sowing seeds of grassland species after application of herbicide may help grassland species colonise the site more effectively. However, herbicide residues may also affect the germination and establishment of sown species.

3419: Mow before or after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Mowing involves cutting grass to a uniform height with specialized machinery. This may help to maintain or increase grassland diversity as well as reducing the abundance of woody plant species. Combining mowing with sowing of seeds or planting may further help to promote diversity by introducing plant species that were not previously present.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of mowing before or after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an unmown but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

3420: Add topsoil before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
When restoring former grasslands converted to agriculture it is often necessary to introduce seeds of some or all species. One way to do this is through the addition of topsoil from intact grasslands. Translocating topsoil may help to increase the number of seeds in the soil, thereby increasing the probability of grassland plants becoming established. The addition of topsoil may also help to increase soil fertility or reduce the effects of processes that dramatically alter soil structure, such as mining or quarrying. Sowing seeds and planting may further increase the likelihood of colonisation by grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding topsoil before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot without topsoil added). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

3421: Add woody debris to protect seeds/plants
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
In natural grasslands, the survival and growth of some plant species may be positively influenced by another plant species as a result of protection from drought or from grazing (Brooker et al. 2008). This observation has led to the use of nurse plants – where the seeds of plants are sown underneath other existing plants in the hope that this will improve their chances of establishment. Adding woody debris for protection is a modification of this idea, where woody debris is added to increase the likelihood that plants sown underneath the debris will survive.

3422: Add charcoal to soil before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Charcoal can be added to soil to increase its fertility, carbon storage, and water retention. When charcoal is used for soil amendment it is commonly known as biochar. Charcoal has a long history of use as a fertilizer, and was used by pre-Colombian Amazonians to enhance soil productivity. Adding charcoal to soil can increase crop yield in agricultural systems (Jeffery et al. 2011), and so addition of charcoal to soil alongside seeding in grasslands may help to increase survival and growth of grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding charcoal to the soil before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an untreated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Grazing with livestock may reduce vegetation height, and disturb soil and vegetation, due to trampling. This may result in small-scale differences in the suitability of grassland habitat to different plant species, and as a result increase species diversity. Sowing seeds may further increase the probability of grassland species establishing successfully.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of grazing with livestock after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an ungrazed but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

3425: Add mulch before or after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Mulch is organic material, such as leaves or bark, which is spread over soil with the aim of improving germination and survival of target plants. Mulch may increase soil water availability, thereby aiding plant germination (Donath et al. 2007) as well as protecting against erosion. However, thick mulch layers may also prevent the germination of seeds that respond to changes in light and temperature, and survival of seedlings that are shaded by mulch (Facelli & Pickett 1991, Suding & Goldberg 1999).
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding mulch before or after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an unmulched but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
The addition of fertilizer includes addition of any substance to the soil that may increase its fertility. This includes addition of chemical fertilizers, as well as compost and other organic matter. Addition of fertilizers to soils can help to increase nutrient concentration. Addition of organic matter can also increase soil microbe abundance in degraded soils (Ros et al. 2003). These changes in soil conditions may increase the likelihood of colonisation of a degraded habitat by grassland species, particularly when combined with sowing seeds.

3429: Inoculate soil with mycorrhiza before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Modern agricultural practices such as ploughing and application of pesticides and fertilizer may reduce the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi (Helgason et al. 1998, Johnson 1993). As a result, addition of mycorrhiza to degraded habitats may help natural plant communities to establish.
Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi often involves the transfer of soil or plant material where mycorrhiza are already present to new areas. These microorganisms can increase nutrient uptake and protect against root pathogens (Smith & Read 2008). In grasslands, mycorrhizal fungi can increase species diversity and productivity (Van der Heijden et al. 1998).
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an untreated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding an erosion blanket after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot without an erosion blanket). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of using erosion blankets after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one study was in Spain.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were paired and two randomized) in the USA and Spain found that using an erosion blanket after seeding and planting did not alter vegetation cover. The other study found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant density.

3432: Sow native grass and forbs
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Following land use change, grassland seeds often die. As a result, when grassland restoration is undertaken grass and forb seeds are often added in an attempt to aid the colonisation of grassland species.
This section considers sowing of grass and forb species. This includes studies where soil has been disturbed by ploughing alongside sowing, as this is often an inherent part of sowing seeds. For details on studies that test the impact of soil disturbance on the success of sowing, see the intervention ‘Disturb soil before seeding/planting’. For details of studies that only sowed seeds of grass or forb species, see the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’ and ‘Sow grassland forb species.’

Key Messages:

Fifty studies examined the effects of sowing native grass and forb seeds on grassland vegetation. Thirty-six studies were in Europe, twelve studies were in North America and one study was in New Zealand. One review included studies from Europe, North America and Africa.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (42 STUDIES)

Community composition (11 studies): Five of 11 studies (10 of which were replicated and/or controlled, and three of which were site comparisons) in the UK, the Czech Republic, Norway and Germany found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the similarity of plant community composition to that of target communities. Three studies found no increase in community similarity to target communities. Two studies found that over time communities became more similar to those of intact grasslands. One study found that over time areas sown with native grass and forb seeds became more similar to areas that were not sown with seeds.
Overall richness/diversity (28 studies): Sixteen of 28 studies (24 of which were controlled and four of which were site comparisons) in Europe, North America and New Zealand found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall plant species richness. Seven studies found that there was no change in plant species richness or mixed effects on plant species richness and plant diversity. Three studies found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first year, but after 3–13 years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas or was lower in sown areas. One study found that after one year, sowing did not alter plant species richness but after eight years, species richness was higher than in unsown areas. Three studies found that species richness was lower in sown areas than in nearby intact grasslands.
Characteristic plant richness/diversity (9 studies): Six of nine studies (eight of which were replicated and/or controlled, and two of which were site comparisons) in Europe found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of characteristic grassland plants. Two studies found no change in the species richness of characteristic grassland plants. One study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of target forbs but not target grasses.
Sown/planted species richness/diversity (3 studies): Three replicated, paired, controlled studies in the UK and the Czech Republic found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased sown species richness.
Grass richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased grass species richness in 54% of cases.
Forb richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased forb species richness in 71% of cases.
Native/non-target richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the species richness of native plants.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (24 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (8 studies): Three of eight replicated, controlled studies (four of which were randomized and paired) in Europe and North America found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased overall vegetation cover, biomass or density. One study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased plant species richness during the first 2–7 years, but after eight years, species richness did not differ between sown and unsown areas. Four studies found that there was no change in overall vegetation abundance in all or most cases.
Characteristic plant abundance (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (four of which were controlled, and one of which was a site comparison) in Europe found that sowing native grass and forb seeds did not alter the cover of characteristic grassland species. The other two studies found an increase in the cover of characteristic or target grassland species.
Sown/planted species abundance (6 studies): Five of six studies (four of which were replicated and controlled, and two of which were reviews) in Europe, North America, Africa and New Zealand found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in all or most cases. The other study found mixed effects on sown species abundance.
Grass abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, randomized, controlled studies (two of which were paired) in the Czech Republic and the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover of grass species. The other study found no change in the cover of grass species.
Forb abundance (4 studies): Three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies (three of which were paired) in the Czech Republic and the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover or density of forb species. The other study found that one year after sowing, the cover of forb species increased, but after 10 years it did not differ between sown and unsown areas.
Native/non-target species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover of native plant species.
Individual plant species abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that sowing native grass and forb seeds did not alter yellow rattle abundance.

3433: Add carbon to soil before or after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Carbon amendments, such as sugar and/or sawdust, can be added to soil to reduce the nitrogen available to plants. This may reduce competition from fast-growing non-native and invasive plants, which may increase the survival and growth of native species after seeding or planting.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding carbon to soil before or after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an untreated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of adding carbon to soil before or after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Both studies were in the USA.
