2323: Provide diversionary feeding for mammals to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals are attracted to residential or business areas by availability of food or other resources. Whilst many such mammals go unnoticed some, such as bears that raid garbage bins, can be perceived as a threat to humans or can cause damage to property or create a mess. Such animals are sometimes managed by being translocated to sites away from built-up areas whilst lethal control may be carried out in some situations. If diversionary feeding can reduce the extent to which animals exhibit nuisance behaviour, this may reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control or other intensive management.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
At some sites, such as at national parks where safaris are a popular means of visitors observing animals, large numbers of people or vehicles closely approaching mammals may cause them disturbance or cause changes in their behaviour. This may restrict areas that these animals use or affect hunting or feeding opportunities. Limits, including through voluntary guidelines, exist in some areas on the minimum distance to which people or vessels may approach sea mammals (e.g. Inman et al. 2016). Similar regulation or guidelines may also lessen such potential impacts for mammals.

2330: Exclude or limit number of visitors to reserves or protected areas
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Protected areas are often popular with visitors as they may contain extensive areas suited for outdoor recreation. However, high visitor numbers can damage features that reserves and protected areas are established to protect. Some mammals are shy and are thus deterred by visitors whilst others, such as bears, may come into conflict with human visitors. A policy of excluding, restricting or otherwise limiting human visitors may be put in place to reduce the potential impact of such access on wildlife, including mammals.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of excluding or limiting the number of visitors to reserves or protected areas. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Ecuador and one was in Thailand.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): A site comparison study in Ecuador found that a road with restricted access had a higher population of medium-sized and large mammals compared to a road with unrestricted access.
Survival (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that temporarily restricting visitor access resulted in fewer bears being killed to protect humans.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Three studies (one a before-and-after study), in the USA and Thailand, found that restricting human access to protected areas resulted in increased use of these areas by grizzly bears and leopards.

Background information and definitions:
Domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris may have multiple negative impacts on wild mammals including through predation, disease transmission and disturbance (Hughes & Macdonald 2013). In some places, domestic dogs roam freely and are major predators of wild mammals. For example, Wierzbowska et al. (2016) estimated that over 33,000 wild animals (primarily mammals, especially brown hare Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) were killed by free-ranging dogs annually in Poland. Keeping dogs indoors or in outside enclosures may reduce their impacts, including predation, on wild mammals.

2336: Translocate problem mammals away from residential areas (e.g. habituated bears) to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
There is a variety of ways in which mammals in urban, residential or other human-occupied locations can come into conflict with people. Some species may raid garbage and create a mess while doing so, some may cause damage to gardens or parks, some may act aggressively towards humans and some mammals present substantial road traffic hazards. In many communities, there is a pressure to address these issues by focussing solutions on preventing or deterring mammals from accessing such areas. One such method is translocation, typically to an area away from habitation. This intervention can fail if translocated animals continue to cause problems at residential areas (including by returning to their capture site) or if survival of translocated animals is low. If the intervention is successful, it can reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.
See also: Species management - Translocate mammals.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of translocating problem mammals (such as bears) away from residential areas to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Six studies were in the USA, two were in Canada, one was Russia, one was in India and one was in Romania.

Survival (6 studies): A controlled study in the USA found that grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than did non-translocated bears. A replicated study study in the USA found that fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year. Two of three studies (two controlled), in the USA, found that after translocation away from urban sites, white-tailed deer survival was lower than that of non-translocated deer. The third study found that short-term survival was lower but long-term survival was higher than that of non-translocated deer. A study in Russia found that most Amur tigers translocated after attacking dogs or people did not survive for a year after release.

Human-wildlife conflict (6 studies): Five studies (including one controlled and two replicated studies), in the USA and Canada, of brown/grizzly or black bears translocated away from residential areas or human-related facilities, found that at least some returned to their original capture location and/or continued to cause nuisance. In two of the studies, most returned to their capture area and one black bear returned six times following translocation. A before-and-after study in India found that leopards translocated away from human-dominated areas, attacked more humans and livestock than before-translocation. A controlled study in Romania found that translocated brown bears occurred less frequently inside high potential conflict areas than outside, the opposite to bears that had not been translocated.

2340: Habituate mammals to visitors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals can show aggressive behaviour towards humans. This can be a problem especially where the species is one in high demand from humans for opportunities to watch them, and one that is capable of causing serious injury or death to humans if it does attack. This is most likely to involve large charismatic carnivores. Where animals are predictable in their movements, there may be opportunities for habituating them to humans, thus reducing the risk to visitors. This may also, then, reduce instances in which there are pressures on wildlife managers to carry out lethal control of animals that show aggressive behaviours.

2341: Translocate mammals that have habituated to humans (e.g. bears)
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Some animals, such as bears, may exhibit “nuisance behaviour” that may bring them into conflict with humans. For example, animals may attempt to raid foodstuffs at campgrounds and such individuals may then be perceived as representing a threat to humans. Animals may be translocated away from sites where issues arise, as an alternative to lethal control. Such translocations are deemed to be successful if the animal survives and resumes natural behaviour at the release site, does not return to the capture site and does not exhibit “nuisance behaviour” elsewhere.

2343: Place orphaned or abandoned wild young with wild foster parents
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Young mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. An alternative to captive rearing may be to attempt to foster young into existing wild families. If this can be achieved, it may improve their ability to find food in the wild and reduce the extent to which they become imprinted on humans and could, thus, improve the prospects of longer-term survival in the wild. However, the success of such programmes can be difficult to judge, without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Bears can be opportunistic feeders that sometimes raid sources of food left by humans. If food in garbage containers is not secured, this too can be targeted. As well as potentially causing mess, bears attracted to garbage containers may come to associate humans with sources of food and their behaviour may become problematic, through displays of aggression or boldness. Such animals may be translocated or lethally controlled. The issue could be reduced if food in garbage containers is made inaccessible to bears. Issuing enforcement notices is one way of attempting to increase compliance with legislation requiring proper use of bear-proof dumpsters.

Some mammals will utilize food, denning sites or other resources in human modified environments in such ways that risks them being regarded as exhibiting nuisance behaviour. Such behaviour might include damaging property, creating mess, causing noise disturbance or posing a perceived threat to humans.

2358: Hand-rear orphaned or abandoned young in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Young mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. Success of such programmes can be difficult to judge, without benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.
This intervention includes studies where mammals are hand-reared. See also Place captive young with captive foster parents and Place orphaned or abandoned wild young with captive foster parents.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects of hand-rearing orphaned mammals. Two were in the USA, one each was in Australia, South Africa and India and one was in six countries across North America, Europe and Asia.

Young mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken in by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often, this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation though for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities for choosing where to augment populations. If such mammals can be fostered in captivity by parents of the same species, it may reduce the extent to which they become imprinted on humans and could improve the prospects of post-release survival in the wild.

Background information and definitions:
This intervention entails allowing field margin vegetation to regenerate naturally, typically without planting. It can involve some subsequent mowing. Field margins are not fertilized. This intervention includes field margins that run alongside waterways, where these are not otherwise managed, such as by planting trees (for which, see Habitat Restoration and Creation - Restore or create forest).

Key Messages:

2367: Provide supplementary food to increase reproduction/survival
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Many mammals have long gained a proportion of their diet as a direct result of human activities (Oro et al. 2013). Many of these are cases where by-products of production, harvesting or consumption are exploited. However, in some cases, food is provided specifically for mammals. This is often to increase survival and condition of hunted animals, such as deer. In some other cases, food may be provided to aid the conservation status of rare species. Some studies are less directly conservation-motivated but are included here if the findings can help to inform conservation actions.
Studies that provide supplementary food as part of translocation or reintroduction programmes are discussed in: Provide supplementary food during/after release of translocated mammals and Provide supplementary food during/after release of captive-bred mammals.

Key Messages:

Twenty-four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing supplementary food to increase reproduction/survival. Nine studies were in the USA, two were in Canada, two were in South Africa, two were in Poland, and one each was in Sweden, the Netherlands, eSwatini, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Austria, Norway and Sweden and one was across North America and Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (18 STUDIES)

Abundance (8 studies): Four of eight studies (incuding four controlled, two site comparisons and five before-and-after studies) in the USA, Canada, South Africa, Poland and Austria found that supplementary feeding increased the abundance or density of bank voles, red squirrels, striped mice, brown hyena and black-backed jackals. One study found a temporary increased in prairie vole abundance. The other three studies found supplementary feeding not to increase abundance or density of white-footed mice, northern flying squirrels, Douglas squirrels or Eurasian otters.
Reproduction (8 studies): Four of five controlled studies (three also replicated) in the USA, South Africa, Norway and Sweden, Sweden and Spain, found that supplementary food increased the proportion of striped mice that were breeding, the number of arctic fox litters and the size of prairie vole litters. However, there was no increase in the number of arctic fox cubs in each litter or the proportion of female Iberian lynx breeding. One of two replicated studies (one site comparison and one controlled), in the Netherlands and the USA, found that supplementary feeding increased the number of young wild boar produced and recruited in to the population. The other study found that the number of mule deer produced/adult female did not increase. A review of studies across North America and Europe found that supplementary feeding increased ungulate reproductive rates in five of eight relevant studies.
Survival (9 studies): Four of eight studies (including seven controlled studies and two before-and-after studies) in the USA, Canada, Poland and Spain, found that supplementary feeding increased survival of mule deer, bank voles, northern flying squirrels and eastern cottontail rabbits. Five studies found no increase in survival for white-tailed deer, Douglas squirrels, mule deer, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep lambs or Iberian lynx. A review of studies across North America and Europe found that supplementary feeding increased ungulate survival in four out of seven relevant studies.
Condition (4 studies): One of three studies (including two controlled and two before-and-after studies) in Poland, the USA, and Canada, found that supplementary food lead to weight gain or weight recovery in bank voles. One study found no body mass increase with supplementary feeding in northern flying squirrels and Douglas squirrels. The third study found mixed results, with supplementary feeding increasing weight gains in some cotton rats, depending on their sex, weight and the time of year. A review of studies from across North America and Europe found that different proportions of studies found supplementary feeding to improve a range of measures of ungulate condition.

BEHAVIOUR (6 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in Sweden found that supplementary food increased occupancy of Arctic fox dens. A replicated study in Portugal found that artificial feeding stations were used by European rabbits.
Behaviour (4 studies): Two of three replicated studies (two also controlled), in eSwatini, Slovenia and the USA, found that supplementary feeding led to reduced home range sizes or shorter movements of red deer and elk. The third study found home ranges and movement distances to be similar between fed and unfed multimammate mice. One replicated study in Poland found that supplementary feeding of ungulates altered brown bear behaviour.

2377: Provide or retain set-aside areas on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European Union agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity on farmland. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5–20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Unlike fallow land, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing. However, set-aside often is managed by cutting and/or spraying. In some cases, set-aside land has had wild flowers sown on it. Evidence for the effects of this management has been included under the intervention, Establish wild flower areas on farmland.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing or retaining set-aside areas on farmland. Three studies were in the UK and one was in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including two site comparison studies), in the UK and Switzerland, found that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland, or brown hare numbers relative to numbers on farms without set-aside areas.

2381: Maintain/restore/create habitat connectivity on farmland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of some mammal populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Maintaining, restoring or creating corridors of native vegetation between patches of suitable habitat in agricultural landscapes may help to maintain populations. Some specific actions that may encourage movements through farmland are covered in other interventions, including Plant new or maintain existing hedgerows on farmland and Create uncultivated margins around intensive arable or pasture fields.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of maintaining, restoring or creating habitat connectivity on farmland.

Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification, including increases in field sizes and pesticides use, has resulted in a loss of field margin habitats, such as hedgerows. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Hedge planting and maintenance of existing hedges has, therefore, been proposed as a means of preserving and enhancing biodiversity. Such management is sometimes funded through agri-environmental schemes.

2384: Use conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some animals, such as bears, may exhibit “nuisance behaviour” that may bring them into conflict with humans. This may especially be caused by animals attempting to raid foodstuffs, such as at campgrounds, picnic areas or other places that people gather. As well as causing damage to property and spreading rubbish, such individuals may then be perceived as representing a threat to humans. As an alternative to lethal control, attempts may be made to make such animals associate human food sources with pain or discomfort by lacing foodstuffs with substances that cause gastrointestinal upset. If successful, such animals may subsequently avoid seeking out human sources of food.
Studies considered under this intervention are those concerning human-wildlife conflict away from permanent settlements. For related interventions, see also the Chapter, Residential and commercial development.

2385: Use non-lethal methods to deter carnivores from attacking humans
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Actual or perceived danger to humans from carnivores can prompt lethal control of such animals. If measures can be introduced to reduce these threats, or threatening behaviour, this could reduce human-wildlife conflict and motivations for carrying out lethal control.
For related studies, see Habituate mammals to visitors and Use conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites. Additionally, several other interventions aim to reduce behaviour by wild mammals deemed to be a nuisance (such as raiding garbage containers) and, by reducing the extent to which carnivores and humans come into conflict, may also reduce the chances of attacks on humans. See, for example, Residential and commercial development - Scare or otherwise deter mammals from human-occupied areas to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Prevent mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict.

Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification, which includes increasing field size and pesticide use, has resulted in a loss of shelter and food resources for wildlife, such as that provided by areas of trees. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Tree planting may therefore diversify habitat availability and, in younger plantations, may also provide areas of longer uncut grass than is available elsewhere in the landscape.

2388: Use prescribed burning
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone while in others, habitats are shaped by long-term traditional management (Bowman 1998). Some habitats are now managed through prescribed burning, partly to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. In other areas, burns are being introduced, following long periods of fire suppression, sometimes accompanied by mechanical clearance of woody material. Whilst burning can have a dramatic effect on the landscape, reducing cover and short-term food resources, feeding on new plant growth within burned areas can also increase an animal’s nutritional intake, with concentrations of proteins in particular being elevated (Hobbs & Spowart 1984).
The studies featured generally compare prescribed burning with no management (which in one case means allowing wildfires) but, in some cases, comparisons are with mechanical clearance.

Three studies found mixed effects, on cottontail rabbits and small mammals and two found that burning increased numbers of European rabbits and small mammals. A systematic review in the USA found that two mammal species showed positive responses (abundance or reproduction) to prescribed burning while three showed no response.

2389: Provide refuges during crop harvesting or mowing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
During crop harvesting and mowing operations, mammals may move into adjacent areas of long grass or crops. If mowing/harvesting occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave them trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. However, if unharvested refuges are left in fields then it is possible that mammals remain in them and survive.

2391: Restrict use of rodent poisons on farmland with high secondary poisoning risk
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Rodenticides are in common use around farms, houses and industrial sites. The most frequently used forms are anticoagulant rodenticides, which cause death in target animals by inhibiting blood clotting. Death can take several days after ingestion so poisoning may be passed on up the food chain both to predators and to scavengers. In some situations, a high proportion of predators may be exposed to secondary poisoning. For example, in one study 85% of fisher Pekania pennanti carcasses collected showed signs of exposure (Thompson et al. 2013) whilst another showed signs of exposure in 79% of invasive American Mink, with the risk of exposure being higher in areas with farms (Ruiz-Suárez et al. 2016). Restricting use of such poisons may reduce their ingestion by mammalian carnivores.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Beetle banks are raised strips which run through a field, typically planted with grasses. They primarily serve as an overwintering habitat for beetles, which provide pest control in the spring. By dividing the field, beetle banks reduce the distance that predators have to travel to reach the centre of the crop, a potential problem if overwintering habitat occurs only at the field edge. Beetle banks may also harbour other wildlife, such as small mammals.

2396: Provide supplementary water to increase reproduction/survival
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In arid environments, artificial water sources may be provided to aid survival or population expansion for species of conservation concern (e.g. West et al. 2017). This may be done as part of translocation or reintroduction programmes and also for securing existing populations of threatened species.

2397: Translocate to re-establish or boost populations in native range
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught mammals into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost, or augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, help safe guard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events and/or increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations can also be used to move mammals to areas where threats have been removed, such as invasive predators on islands. However, translocations are typically expensive and may risk spreading pathogens to previously unexposed areas.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. This action includes studies describing the effects of translocation programmes that do not provide details of specific release techniques. Studies that describe or compare specific release techniques, such as use of holding pens at release sites, or providing supplementary food, water or artificial refuges/breeding sites are described under each specific action.
This action includes studies where animals were released in groups but not studies where releases of different group sizes were compared, or where animals were released in family or social groups (including groups where social animals have been pre-conditioned together prior to release in holding pens). For those studies, see Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in larger unrelated groups and Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in family/social groups.

Key Messages:

Sixty-four studies evaluated the effects of translocating mammals to re-establish or boost populations in their native range. Twenty studies were in the USA, eight in Italy, four in Canada and South Africa, three in the Netherlands and Spain, two in each of the USA and Canada, Zimbabwe, Sweden, Australia and the USA and Mexico and one in each of Uganda, the UK, Brazil, France, Portugal, Africa, Europe, North America, Botswana, Nepal, Chile, Slovakia, Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland and one global study.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (62 STUDIES)

Abundance (22 studies): Two studies (incuding one controlled and one before-and-after, site comparison study) in Spain and Canada found that translocating animals increased European rabbit abundance or American badger population growth rate at release sites. Fourteen studies (one replicated) in South Africa, the USA, the Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain found that following translocation, populations of warthogs, Eurasian beavers, red squirrels, roe deer, Alpine ibex, Iberian ibex, Cape mountain zebra, 22 species of grazing mammals, black bears, brown bear, bobcats and most populations of river otters increased. Two reviews in South Africa and Australia found that reintroductions (mainly through translocations) led to increasing populations for four of six species of large carnivores and that over half of translocations were classified as successful. One replicated study in the USA and Mexico found that translocating desert bighorn sheep did not increase the population size. Two studies (one replicated) and a review in USA and Canada, the USA and Australia found that translocated American martens, and sea otters at four of seven sites, established populations and that translocated and released captive-bred macropod species established populations in 44 of 72 cases. A study in Italy found that following the translocation of red deer, the density of Apennine chamois in the area almost halved. A worldwide review found that translocating ungulates was more successful when larger numbers were released, and small populations grew faster if they contained more mature individuals and had an equal ratio of males and females.
Reproductive success (16 studies): A controlled study in Italy found that wild-caught translocated Apennine chamois reproduced in similar numbers to released captive-bred chamois. Fourteen studies (four replicated) in Canada, the USA, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia found that translocated black and white rhinoceroses, warthogs, common dormice, European ground squirrels, cougars, bobcats, brown bears, sea otters, river otters and some Eurasian otters reproduced. A study in the Netherlands found that translocated beavers were slow to breed.
Survival (39 studies): Four of five studies (including three controlled, two replicated and one before-and-after, site comparison study) in the USA, Canada and Chile found that wild-born translocated long-haired field mice, female elk, cougars and American badgers had lower survival rates than non-translocated resident animals. One found that translocated Lower Keys marsh rabbits had similar survival rates to non-translocated resident animals. Five of four studies (two replicated, four controlled) and two reviews in Canada, Canada and the USA, the USA, Italy, Sweden and Africa, Europe, and North America found that wild-born translocated swift foxes, European otters, black-footed ferret kits and a mix of carnivores had higher survival rates than released captive-bred animals. One study found that wild-born translocated Apennine chamois had a similar survival rate to released captive-bred animals. Twenty of twenty-one studies (including two replicated and one before-and-after study) and a review in Nepal, France, Italy, Portugal, Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland, Canada, USA, Brazil, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana found that following translocation, populations of or individual mammals survived between two months and at least 25 years. The other two studies found that two of 10 translocated white rhinoceroses died within three days of release and an American marten population did not persist. A review in Australia found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands and the USA and Mexico found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters and common dormice survived three months to seven years. The review found that most black-footed ferret releases were unsuccessful at maintaining a population. A replicated study in the USA found that following translocation of bighorn sheep, 48–98% of their offspring survived into their first winter.
Condition (3 studies): Three studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the USA and Italy found that following translocation, populations of elk had similar levels of genetic diversity to non-translocated populations, descendants of translocated swift fox had genetic diversity at least as high as that of the translocated animals and brown bear genetic diversity declined over time.

BEHAVIOUR (9 STUDIES)

Use (7 studies): A study in Italy found that following translocation, Alpine ibex used similar habitats to resident animals. Two of four studies (including one randomized, controlled study) in the USA, Netherlands and Botswana found that following translocation (and in one case release of some captive-bred animals), most Eurasian otters settled and all three female grizzly bears established ranges at their release site. The other two studies found that most nine-banded armadillos and some white rhinoceroses (when released into areas already occupied by released animals) dispersed from their release site. Two studies (one replicated) in Spain found that following translocation, Iberian ibex expanded their range and roe deer increased their distribution six-fold.
Behaviour change (2 studies): A replicated controlled study in Chile found that following translocation, long-haired field mice travelled two- to four-times further than non-translocated mice. A controlled study in Italy found that wild-caught translocated Apennine chamois moved further from the release site than released captive-bred animals.

Background information and definitions:
In highly managed populations of wild mammalian herbivores, locations of enclosures or other constraining features can determine what food is available for animals. Some populations may be maintained on food imported from elsewhere. However, making pasture available might provide a higher quality diet than can be offered with imported food and this might have positive effects on the population.

Numerous studies assess responses of grassland vegetation structure and composition to different mowing regimes. Responses of fauna are less frequently documented with invertebrate responses dominating among those that are published. Some mammalian herbivores may be sensitive to variations in grassland vegetation height and structure (Mero et al. 2015). An understanding of responses to changes in mowing regimes may assist with development of tailored management for particular species.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves leaving areas of uncut ryegrass Lolium perenne in silage fields. Ryegrass seeds are a potential food source for small mammals, but cutting ryegrass fields multiple times a year for silage removes seed heads before they can ripen and so reduces the food available the following winter. Leaving fields or plots uncut may provide overwinter food for small mammals and may also provide suitable habitat away from damaging harvesting machinery.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving areas of uncut ryegrass in silage field.

Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Overgrazing is responsible for the degradation of habitats across the world, being especially damaging in arid environments, where the removal of vegetation can quickly lead to soil erosion. Reducing grazing intensity may reduce the damage to vegetation and can also help reduce disturbance to mammals and accidental loss of nests of small mammal species.

2412: Change type of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Domestic herbivores differ in the way that they graze. In particular, some species are more selective than others, and so will concentrate grazing in areas with highly palatable plant species. This may generate different effects on vegetation dynamics than does grazing by more generalist herbivores (Evans et al. 2015). Furthermore, large herbivores, such as cattle, may disturb the ground more through their footprints than is the case for smaller grazers, such as sheep. Such effects may produce a vegetation sward and structure than is more or less suited for wild mammals.

Where farmers suffer losses to wild mammals, either through predation of livestock or damage to crops, they may carry out lethal control of those mammals. Compensation schemes provide payments for losses to wild mammals and can have certain conditions, such as cessation of using lethal control or improving animal husbandry to reduce losses. The intervention includes schemes that make payments linked directly to losses (e.g. paying for each animal predated) and schemes that where payment is not linked directly to losses but instead to other mechanism that reduce incentives for killing wild mammals.

2415: Install non-electric fencing to exclude predators or herbivores and reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild mammals can compete with domestic herbivores for food, can predate domestic herbivores or can damage crops. Human-wildlife conflict can be reduced if wild mammals can be effectively excluded from fields or other areas of crops or livestock. Non-electric fences are extensively used and can reduce the risk of wild mammal incursions into such sites. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such mammals. Non-electric fences may be more suited to more extensive farming situations than are electric fences, as they may require less maintenance. This intervention also includes fortification of bomas (traditional livestock enclosures constructed by pastoralists) using conventional fencing materials such as fence wires.

Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone while in others, habitats are shaped by long-term traditional management (Bowman 1998). Some habitats are now managed through prescribed burning, partly to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. The timing of such burns may impact the mammal fauna with changes to different burning dates potentially being beneficial (or, at least, less damaging) to some species.

2418: Provide shelter structures after fire
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an integral part of the dynamics of some ecosystems. It can clear out woody material, creating ideal conditions for new growth or herbaceous plants and small trees that are utilized by mammalian grazers and browsers. However, fire can also be disruptive to species, by removing cover. It may make them more vulnerable to effects of extreme weather and to predation and can cause them to seek out remaining vegetated areas that provide some degree of shelter (e.g. Pereoglou et al. 2011). For rare or otherwise valued species, shelters, such as low boards with space underneath, might be distributed across the burn area to help mitigate these effects.

2421: Use flags to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Coloured flags (fladry) hung from fences are thought to deter crossings by wolves Canis lupus and potentially other predatory mammals. Thus, the intervention has potential for reducing predation on enclosed livestock. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predatory mammals. The studies include both wild carnivores and captive wolves in experimental trials.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using flags to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Three studies were in the USA, one was in Italy and one was in Canada.

2422: Use campaigns and public information to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mammals face a range of threats from humans. These may include exploitation through hunting or persecution if the mammal is perceived as a threat or a nuisance. In some cases, mammals are protected by regulations and laws but these may be difficult to enforce. Some infringements may be difficult to detect whilst, in other cases, people may be unaware of their responsibilities under such rules. Campaigns may be designed to increase compliance with laws, to encourage reporting of infringements, such as illegal hunting, or to reduce behaviours that can be a threat to mammals, such as consumption of products derived from wild mammals. These may use a variety of media and ranging from broadcasting and social media through to word of mouth.

2423: Provide education programmes to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Where human behaviour is central to the threat to a species, an education programme may be devised to address this. Such programmes may tackle a wide range of threats to mammals and be aimed to difference audiences, such as local residents, farmers or other businesses. The effects of programmes may be measured in terms of the response of target species or in terms of changes in human behaviour that directly impact the magnitude of the threat.
This intervention covers situations where awareness of ways of reducing threats to mammals is focussed on specific narrow target groups, largely through one-to-one interactions. For more widely-targeted programmes, see Use campaigns and public information to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats.

2424: Provide science-based films, radio programmes, or books about mammals to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There are different types of media that can be used to inform people and raise their awareness about threats to mammals and their conservation. Environmental education campaigns frequently use film, sound or print media to present either factual information or fictional stories that have parallels to environmental issues. It can be difficult to assess the impact of such initiatives, as it is harder to assess people’s subsequent behaviours than it is to measure their stated attitudes towards mammals after exposure to media.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of providing science-based films, radio programmes, or books about mammals to improve behaviour towards mammals and reduce threats.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.

Background information and definitions:
Carnivores may be killed by farmers where they feel that their livestock are threatened. National laws or policies protecting wild mammals may be difficult to enforce at a local level. Local staff, from among the same communities as the farmers, may be able to gain more respect and to work more closely with farmers to find ways to reduce losses to predators without carrying out lethal control.

2428: Use pheromones to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pheromones are chemical substances released into the environment by an animal that can affect the behaviour or physiology of other animals of the same species. If pheromones can be synthesised that deter wild mammalian predators from approaching and predating livestock, this could reduce the motivation among farmers for carrying out lethal control of such predators.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using pheromones to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

2429: Use taste-aversion to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to deter human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild mammalian predators can cause unacceptable levels of livestock losses. Human-wildlife conflict can be reduced if wild mammals can be effectively deterred from attacking livestock. This intervention covers the use of substances that cause unpleasant effects in mammals, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, but at a dose not intended to cause long-term harm to the animal. Most studies are trials using captive animals, especially coyotes Canis latrans. One study included here is a trial of using the same approach to deter predation of bird eggs. This would most likely find application in poultry or game rearing operations, and so is included here given that the intention could be to reduce economic losses caused by wild mammals. If the intervention is effective at reducing predation, it could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of mammalian predators.

Key Messages:

Nine studies evaluated the effects of using taste-aversion to reduce predation of livestock by mammals to deter human-wildlife conflict. Six studies were in the USA, two were in Canada and one was at an unnamed location.

2430: Translocate mammals to reduce overpopulation
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Overpopulation can reduce the long-term persistence of a population, as competition for resources increases. Translocating individuals of the target species away from the area or predators into the area for example, to reduce population numbers may help reduce competition for resources and thus improve the fitness of the remaining population.

2431: Translocate predators for ecosystem restoration
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In areas where predators have historically been made locally extinct or populations severely reduced, often due to hunting, they may be translocated from other areas and released in an attempt to restore the ecosystem. Predators may help to reduce medium to large herbivore populations for example, and thus allow some recovery of the habitat and other species groups.

2432: Dispose of livestock carcasses to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Leaving livestock carcasses in place on farms after death may attract mammalian carnivores that may also attack live farm animals. Carcasses can be removed to eliminate this form of attraction for predators. If this results in fewer predators being attracted to farms and, consequently, less predation on livestock, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such predators.

2433: Use guardian animals (e.g. dogs, llamas, donkeys) bonded to livestock to deter predators to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Using animals to guard livestock is a long-established practice. Usually dogs Canis lupus familiaris are used but occasionally other animals (e.g. llamas Lama glama) may be used. In most cases, guardian animals are raised among livestock and bond to them. If guardian animals can reduce losses of livestock to predators, this may reduce motivations for lethal control of such predators.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects of using guardian animals (e.g. dogs, llamas, donkeys) bonded to livestock to deter mammals from predating these livestock to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Four studies were in the USA, two were in Kenya and one each was in Solvakia, Argentina, Australia, Cameroon, South Africa, and Namibia.

Two studies, (including one site comparison study and one before-and-after study), in Argentina and Namibia, found that using dogs to guard livestock reduced the killing of predators by farmers but the number of black-backed jackals killed by farmers and dogs combined increased. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that fewer sheep guarded by llamas were predated by carnivores in one of two summers whilst a replicated, before-and-after study in South Africa found that using dogs or alpacas to guard livestock reduced attacks by predators. A randomized, replicated, controlled study in USA found that dogs bonded with livestock reduced contact between white-tailed deer and domestic cattle.

2434: Use holding pens at release site prior to release of translocated mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Holding pens at release sites (sometimes termed “soft release”) may be used to enable mammals to become accustomed to new surroundings before release. They are often enclosures containing natural habitat and enabling views of surrounding land. Additionally, some wild translocated mammals may display a homing instinct after release and pens may therefore be used to reduce the chance of animals returning.
The use of holding pens may be employed both for translocations of wild mammals to new sites and releases of captive-bred mammals, here we focus on the first group. See also: Use holding pens at release site prior to release of captive-bred mammals.
For studies that held translocated mammals in captivity away from the release site before release, see: Hold translocated mammals in captivity before release.

Key Messages:

Thirty-five studies evaluated the effects of using holding pens at the release site prior to release of translocated mammals. Ten studies were in the USA, seven were in South Africa, four were in the UK, three studies were in France, two studies were in each of Canada, Australia and Spain and one was in each of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Italy, Ireland and India.

Abundance (4 studies): Three of four studies (two replicated, one before-and-after study) in South Africa, Canada, France and Spain found that following release from holding pens at release sites (in some cases with other associated actions), populations of roe deer, European rabbits and lions increased in size. The other study found that elk numbers increased at two of four sites.
Reproductive success (10 studies): A replicated study in the USA found that translocated gray wolves had similar breeding success in the first two years after release when adult family groups were released together from holding pens or when young adults were released directly into the wild. Seven of nine studies (including two replicated and one controlled study) in Kenya, South Africa, the USA, Italy, Ireland, Australia and the UK found that following release from holding pens at release sites (in some cases with other associated actions), translocated populations of roan, California ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, lions, four of four mammal populations, most female red squirrels and some pine martens reproduced successfully. Two studies found that one of two groups of Cape buffalo and one pair out of 18 Eurasian badgers reproduced.
Survival (26 studies): Two of seven studies (five controlled, three replicated studies) in Canada, the USA, France, the UK found that releasing animals from holding pens at release sites (in some cases with associated actions) resulted in higher survival for water voles and female European rabbits compared to those released directly into the wild. Four studies found that translocated swift foxes, gray wolves, Eurasian lynx and Gunnison's prairie dogs released from holding pens had similar survival rates to those released directly into the wild. One study found that translocated American martens released from holding pens had lower survival than those released directly into the wild. Two of four studies (three controlled) in South Africa, Spain, and the USA found that translocated African wild dogs and European rabbits that spent longer in holding pens at release sites had a higher survival rate after release. One study found mixed effects for swift foxes and one found no effect of time in holding pens for San Joaquin kit foxes. Eleven studies (one replicated) in Kenya, South Africa, the USA, France, Italy, Ireland, India, Australia and the UK found that after release from holding pens at release sites (in some cases with other associated actions), translocated populations or individuals survived between one month and six years, and four of four mammal populations survived. Two studies in the UK and South Africa found that no released red squirrels or rock hyraxes survived over five months or 18 days respectively. One of two controlled studies (one replicated, one before-and-after) in South Africa and the USA found that following release from holding pens, survival of translocated lions was higher than that of resident animals, whilst that of translocated San Joaquin kit foxes was lower than that of resident animals. A study in Australia found that translocated bridled nailtail wallabies kept in holding pens prior to release into areas where predators had been controlled had similar annual survival to that of captive-bred animals.
Condition (1 study): A controlled study in the UK found that translocated common dormice held in pens before release gained weight after release whereas those released directly lost weight.

2436: Translocate predators away from livestock to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Where mammalian predators cause unacceptable losses to farmers, through predation on livestock, they may be translocated from their point of capture and released some distance away. The release site may be an area away from where livestock are kept. The intervention can fail if translocated animals continue to predate livestock or if survival of translocated animals is low. If the intervention is successful, it can reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals. Several other interventions cover translocations that are primarily for conservation of rare or threatened species, such as Translocate to re-establish or boost populations in native range.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects on mammals of translocating predators away from livestock to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

2444: Deter predation of livestock by mammals by having people close by to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Domestic livestock may be vulnerable to mammalian predators. Livestock can be guarded by animals, especially dogs Canis lupus familiaris, or by people (or both). This intervention involves people remaining close to livestock, either actively guarding or simply as a passive deterrent, such as by bringing livestock in at night to an area adjacent to human habitation. If the intervention results in fewer livestock being predated, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of deterring predation of livestock by mammals by having people close by to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in Kenya.

2446: Deter predation of livestock by using shock/electronic dog-training collars to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Electric shock collars may be used on mammalian predators as a form of aversive conditioning. A shock is administered if the animal approaches or attacks livestock. Some studies summarized below test the potential for aversive conditioning to work on captive animals using non-live food and some others studies look at wild mammals, but using artificial food. Whilst not directly assessing the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing livestock predation, these studies provide evidence as to the potential for shock collars to alter animals’ behaviour in a way that could potentially be applied to wild predators in livestock production areas. If using shock collars can reduce livestock predation, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of using shock/electronic dog-training collars to deter predation of livestock to reduce human-wildlife conflict. All five studies were in the USA.

2447: Release translocated/captive-bred mammals at a specific time (e.g. season, day/night)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals are sometimes wild-caught and translocated or bred in captivity and released to re-establish populations that have been lost, or augment an existing population. This action includes studies describing or comparing the effects of translocation projects that release mammals at specific times, such as in specific seasons or at certain times of day or night.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals at a specific time (season or day/night). Three studies were in the USA and one each was in the UK, Canada, Ireland and Hungary.

2448: Fit livestock with protective collars to reduce risk of predation by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Carnivores typically kill their prey by a fatal bite to the neck. Hard collars can protect animals’ necks. This may increase the effort needed by predators to kill livestock and, thus, reduce the likelihood of a fatal bite. If the intervention results in fewer livestock predated, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Background information and definitions:
This intervention specifically refers to use of light and sound in combination, often delivered via a commercially-purchased frightening devise, designed to repel wild mammals. If successful, such an intervention could reduce predation of livestock by predators and thus reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of carnivores. For different applications of similar devices, see Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

2450: Use scent to deter predation of livestock by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Predatory mammals often mark their home ranges with scent, especially by selecting sites for depositing faeces and urine. If artificially placing such scent marks can constrain predators to particular areas and, in particular, to avoid areas where livestock are kept, this might reduce predation of livestock. If effective, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of these predators.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Damage to agricultural crops by mammalian herbivores may cause substantial losses for some farmers. Although labour-intensive, farmers in some areas may directly guard crops. If this can reduce crop losses to mammals, it could reduce incentive for carrying out lethal control of such species.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers may be vulnerable to loss of crops from raids by wild herbivores or to loss of livestock to mammalian predators. The large growth in use of mobile phones makes it easier for farmers to communicate the presence of problem animals to others in the general area. This may allow faster responses in deployment of prevention measures (Lewis et al. 2016). If this reduces crop damage or livestock predation, it might also reduce incentives for lethal control of wild herbivores or predators.

2453: Release translocated/captive-bred mammals into area with artificial refuges/breeding sites
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals that are translocated or captive-bred and released are especially vulnerable immediately after release. At this time, they may struggle to find shelter in an unfamiliar area, or there may be few suitable refuges/breeding sites available in the new area. Furthermore, if the time they spend looking for suitable shelter or breeding sites is increased, this may make them more vulnerable to predation. Hence, providing artificial refuges or breeding sites in the release area may improve longer-term survival and reproductive rates.
See also: Habitat restoration and creation - Provide artificial refuges/breeding sites, provide artificial dens or nest boxes on trees, provide more small artificial breeding sites rather than fewer large sites.

Key Messages:

Seventeen studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals into areas with artificial refuges or breeding sites. Five studies were in the USA, three were in Australia, three were in Spain, two were in the UK and one was in each of Ireland, South Africa, Hungary and Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Two of three studies (two replicated, two controlled) in Spain and the USA found that translocation release sites with artificial burrows provided had higher abundances of European rabbits and densities of California ground squirrels compared to those without. The other study found that abundance of European rabbits following translocation was similar with and without artificial burrows provided. A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that after translocating black-tailed prairie dogs to areas with artificial burrows, colonies increased in size. A before-and-after study in Spain found that translocating European rabbits into areas with artificial refuges to supplement existing populations did not alter rabbit abundance, although two of three populations persisted for at least three years.
Reproductive success (4 studies): Three studies in Australia, Ireland and the UK found that released captive-bred sugar gliders, most translocated female red squirrels and some translocated pine martens provided with nest boxes and supplementary food reproduced. A study of 12 translocation projects in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland found that translocated European ground squirrels released initially into enclosures or burrows with retention caps reproduced after release, whereas those without enclosures or burrows dispersed from release sites.
Survival (9 studies): Five of eight studies in Australia, the USA, UK, Ireland and South Africa found that at release sites with artificial refuges, and in some cases food provided, a population of captive-bred sugar gliders survived at least three years, two of three populations of red-tailed phascogales survived for more than four years, most translocated black bears survived at least one year and over half translocated red squirrels and pine martens survived 8-12 months. Three studies found that at release sites with artificial refuges, food and in one case water provided, no translocated red squirrels survived more than five months, all translocated rock hyraxes died within three months and most translocated Tipton and Heermann’s kangaroo rat spp. died within five days. A randomised, replicated, controlled study in Hungary found that translocated European ground squirrels released into plugged artificial burrows had higher recapture rates than those released into unplugged artificial burrows.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fish farms can attract a range of mammalian predators, causing human-wildlife conflict. For example, questionnaire respondents from among fish farm operators and anglers in the Czech Republic reported between 7% and 17% of fish losses being due to predation by Eurasian otters Lutra lutra (Václavíková et al. 2011). If barriers, such as netting or fencing, can keep predators from accessing fish, this may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals can become significant predators of fish being reared in fish farms. For example, one study found that rainbow trout Onchorhynchus mykiss from a fish farm formed 87% of biomass of prey consumed by otters Lutra lutra in the vicinity (Marques et al. 2007). Deviation ponds are sites where fish are made easily accessible to predators in order to keep them away from other, more valuable, fish kept elsewhere on the site. If effective, this intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of mammalian predators of fish.

2458: Hold translocated mammals in captivity before release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention refers to holding translocated mammals in captivity away from the release site, before release. This may be done for a number of reasons such as logistics, to allow health checks to take place, to give captured animals time to form social groups, or to use animals in a captive breeding program. Time in captivity may be a few days, months or even a couple of years, depending on the reason for holding individuals in captivity before release.

Aversive conditioning is the process of associating a negative stimulus with a secondary behaviour or outcome. In the case of this intervention, it involves associating a negative stimuli with a neutral one (noise) when carrying out undesirable behaviour (feeding on crops) to the extent that the neutral stimuli alone deters this behaviour.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals are sometimes wild-caught and translocated or bred in captivity and released to re-establish populations that have been lost, or to augment an existing population. This action includes studies comparing the effects of translocating or releasing mammals in larger, unrelated groups (i.e. not family or social groups), rather than in smaller groups (which might include as few as one animal). This may be done for a variety of reasons, such as increased protection against predators, greater access to potential mates or social groups and an increased chance of establishing self-sustaining breeding populations.
Studies of unrelated translocated mammals that were held together to form social groups prior to release, or unrelated captive-bred animals raised and released together are described in Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in family/social groups.

Ten studies (one replicated) in Poland, Russia, Italy, South Africa, the USA, USA–Canada border, China and India found that when translocated and/or captive-bred animals were released in social or family groups, a population of Przewalski’s horses and European bison persisted 5-11 years, lions, most swift foxes and European beavers and half or more cheetahs survived for at least one year, and one-horned rhinoceroses and over half of Gunnison's prairie dogs and Eurasian badgers survived at least 1-6 months. Three studies in the USA and South Africa found that when translocated or captive-bred animals were released in family or social groups (some provided with artificial refuges and/or supplementary food), most Mexican wolves did not survive over eight months and all rock hyraxes died within 90 days. A study in South Africa found that translocated and captive-bred African wild dogs released in family groups into fenced reserves had high survival rates.
Condition (1 study): A study in China found that following the release of captive-bred Przewalski’s horses in groups, the population had a lower genetic diversity than two captive populations.

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two replicated, controlled (one before-and-after) studies in the USA found that when translocated as a social or family group, white-tailed deer had similar average dispersal distances and Utah prairie dogs had similar release site fidelity and post-release behaviour compared to those translocated as unrelated groups. One found that deer translocated together did not stay together, whether they had previously been part of the same social group or not. A study in Zimbabwe found that a translocated lion family joined with immigrant lions and formed a new pride. A study in South Africa found that translocated lions that were released in groups that had already been socialised and formed into prides, established stable home ranges.

2464: Release translocated/captive-bred mammals to islands without invasive predators
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals are sometimes wild-caught and translocated or bred in captivity and released to islands that are free of invasive predators to give them the best chance of establishing breeding populations and persisting. These could either be islands that have never had non-native predators introduced to them or those from which non-native predators have been eradicated.

2466: Airborne translocation of mammals using parachutes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Translocating animals into remote terrain can be logistically challenging. Holding animals for several days while moving across ground can cause them stress and, potentially, illness or mortality. Dropping animals from an airplane means that they can be held captive for shorter periods, though it may be harder to choose the precise release location. Parachutes, combined with a container that opens upon landing, can be used in aerial drops.

Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals that are being translocated to a new location may be released into fenced areas. This may be done to keep them within a certain area (e.g. a game reserve), or to keep predators or other problem species out of an area to increase their chances of survival. Here fenced areas refer to those that are large enough to cover the home ranges of the target species. Studies that use smaller holding or pre-release pens before releasing translocated mammals into the wild are covered in Use holding pens at release site prior to release of translocated mammals.

2469: Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in areas with invasive/problematic species eradication/control 
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals are sometimes wild-caught and translocated, or bred in captivity and released to areas where invasive predators or problematic native species have been eradicated or controlled, to re-establish populations that have been lost, or augment an existing population. Alternatively, ongoing predator control may be undertaken during and after releases. This action includes studies describing or comparing the effects of projects that release mammals after the eradication or control of invasive or problematic species, and studies where the problematic species has been controlled shortly after the release of the species of concern. However, it does not include such projects undertaken on islands, those are discussed under Release translocated/captive-bred mammals to islands without invasive predators.

Key Messages:

Twenty-two studies evaluated the effects of releasing translocated or captive-bred mammals in areas with eradication or control of invasive or problematic species. Sixteen studies were in Australia, four were in the USA, and one in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (21 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): A replicated study in Australia found that increasing amounts of regular predator control increased population numbers of released captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots. Two studies in Australia found that following eradication or control of invasive species, a population of translocated and released captive-bred burrowing bettongs increased and a population of translocated western barred bandicoots increased over four years. A study in Australia found that following the release of captive-bred bridled nailtail wallabies and subsequent predator controls, numbers increased over a three years, but remained low compared to the total number released.
Reproductive success (2 studies): A study in Australia found that four of five captive-bred mammal populations released into a predator-free enclosure and one population released into a predator-reduced enclosure produced a second generation, whereas two populations released into an unfenced area with ongoing predator management did not survive to reproduce. A study in Australia found that most female captive-reared black-footed rock-wallabies released into a large predator-free fenced area reproduced.
Survival (18 studies): Ten studies (one controlled, three replicated, two before-and-after studies) in Australia, and the UK found that following the eradication/control of invasive species (and in some cases release into a fenced area), a translocated population of woylies, western barred bandicoots and red-tailed phascogales survived over four years, released captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots survived up to three years at five of seven sites, offspring of translocated golden bandicoots survived three years, over half of released captive-reared black-footed rock-wallabies survived over two years, captive-bred water voles survived for at least 20 months or over 11 months at over half of release sites, most released captive-bred hare-wallabies survived at least two months, most captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots survived for over three weeks. A replicated study in Australia found that after the control of invasive species, four translocated populations of burrowing bettongs died out within four months. A review of studies in Australia found that in seven studies where red fox control was carried out before or after the release of captive-bred eastern-barred bandicoots, survival varied. A study in Australia found that four of five captive-bred mammal populations released into a predator-free enclosure and one population released into a predator-reduced enclosure survived, whereas two populations released into an unfenced area with ongoing predator management did not. A study in Australia found that captive-bred bridled nailtail wallabies released from holding pens in areas where predators had been controlled had similar annual survival rates to that of wild-born translocated animals. Two studies (one replicated) in the USA found that where predators were managed, at least half of released captive-bred black-footed ferrets survived more than two weeks, but that post-release mortality was higher than resident wild ferrets. A before-and-after study in the USA found following the onset of translocations of black bears away from an elk calving site, survival of the offspring of translocated elk increased.
Condition (2 studies): A study Australia found that wild-born golden bandicoots, descended from a translocated population released into a predator-free enclosure, maintained genetic diversity relative to the founder and source populations. A replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that one to two years after release into predator-free fenced reserves, translocated eastern bettongs weighed more and had improved nutritional status compared to before release.

2470: Provide supplementary food during/after release of translocated mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals that are translocated are especially vulnerable immediately after release. At this time, they may struggle to find natural food in an unfamiliar area. Furthermore, if the time they spend looking for food is increased, this may make them more vulnerable to predation. Hence, providing supplementary food at and after the period of release may improve longer term survival prospects.
See also: Provide supplementary food during/after release of captive-bred mammals.

Key Messages:

Sixteen studies evaluated the effects of providing supplementary food during/after release of translocated mammals. Four studies were in the UK, two were in each of the USA, France, Australia and Argentina, and one was in each of Italy, Spain, Ireland and South Africa.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)

A study in France found that following supplementary feeding in a holding pen prior to release, a translocated deer population increased over six years.
Reproductive success (4 studies): Three studies (one replicated) in the USA, Italy and Ireland found that having been provided with supplementary food in holding pens prior to release, translocated black-tailed prairie dogs, a pair of Eurasian badgers and most female red squirrels reproduced in the wild. A study in the UK found that some translocated pine martens released from holding pens and then provided with supplementary food and nest boxes bred in the first year after release.
Survival (10 studies): Six of 10 studies (including one replicated and one controlled study) in the UK, France, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, USA, Argentina and Australia found that at sites with supplementary food in holding pens before (and in two cases after) release, translocated populations of black-tailed prairie dogs, approximately half of female roe deer and over half of red squirrels, Eurasian badgers, pine martens and released rehabilitated or captive reared giant anteaters survived for between one month and at least two years. Four studies found that at translocation release sites with provision of supplementary food, in most cases artificial refuges and in one case water, no red squirrels, rock hyraxes or burrowing bettongs survived over 2-5 months and most translocated Tipton and Heermann’s kangaroo rat spp. died within five days. A controlled study in France found that translocated European rabbits provided with supplementary food in holding pens for three days prior to release had higher female (but not male) survival rates immediately following release compared to those released directly. A controlled study in the UK found that survival of translocated and rehabilitated European hedgehogs that were provided with supplementary food after release varied with release method.
Condition (2 studies): One of three studies (including one replicated, one controlled and two before-and-after studies) in the UK and Australia found that translocated common dormice gained weight after being provided with supplementary food. One found that translocated eastern bettongs did not have increased body weights after provision of supplementary food in fenced enclosures prior to release. The other found that translocated and rehabilitated European hedgehogs provided with food after release all lost body mass, with effects varying with release method.

2471: Breed mammals in captivity 
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. It tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection and adaptation to captive conditions.
The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce species to sites that were occupied in the past or to introduce species to new sites. Some captive populations may also be used for research to benefit wild populations.
Studies that investigate the effectiveness of releasing captive-bred mammals are discussed elsewhere. Those studies are not included in this section, unless specific details about captive breeding were included.

2472: Place captive young with captive foster parents
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Success of captive breeding programmes for endangered mammal species may be reduced if the biological parents are unable to rear any or all of their young. This may occur when there are more young than parents can rear, or through disease, injury or death of the parents. One option may be to place the young with captive foster parents of the same species, where such animals are available. This may reduce the risk of the young becoming imprinted on humans (which could occur if they were hand reared) and so could increase their chance of survival after release into the wild.
Studies reported on here are examples of where this action is carried out in an experimental way, but where the results could help inform actions in future programmes.

Background information and definitions:
During programmes to rear endangered animals in captivity, in preparation for reintroductions into the wild, artificial insemination may be used to initiate pregnancies. The technique may be used instead of natural mating in situations such as animals being kept at different facilities or where natural mating has failed. It may also be carried out using preserved sperm for purposes of maintaining genetic diversity.
Studies included here are those identified by our searches of conservation journals. It is likely that other relevant studies exist in biological journals that specialise in reproduction.

2476: Release captive-bred individuals to re-establish or boost populations in native range
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild (often called ‘reintroduction’) to either re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population (‘restocking’).
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. This action includes studies describing the effects of release programmes for captive-bred or captive-reared mammals that do not provide details of specific release techniques. Studies that describe or compare specific release techniques, such as use of holding pens at release sites, or providing supplementary food, water or artificial refuges/breeding sites are described under each specific action.
This action includes studies where animals were released in groups but not studies where releases of different group sizes were compared, or where animals were released in family or social groups (including groups where social animals have been pre-conditioned together prior to release in holding pens). For those studies, see Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in larger unrelated groups and Release translocated/captive-bred mammals in family/social groups.

Key Messages:

Thirty-one studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred mammals to establish or boost populations in their native range. Seven studies were in the USA, three were in Australia and Italy, two studies were in each of Canada, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, the UK, the Netherlands and South Africa and one study was in each of France, Africa, Europe, and North America, Estonia, the USA and Mexico, Poland and China.

Abundance (7 studies): Five of five studies (one replicated) and two reviews in Saudi Arabia, Australia, the USA, South Africa, France, the Netherlands and China found that following release of captive-bred (or in one case captive-reared, or including translocated) animals, populations of mountain gazelles, Corsican red deer, Père David's deer, Eurasian otters and swift foxes increased. The two reviews found that following release of mainly translocated but some captive-bred large carnivores, populations of four of six species increased, and over half of mammal release programmes were considered successful.
Reproductive success (5 studies): Four studies (one replicated) in Saudi Arabia, the UK and the Netherlands found that released captive-bred (and in some cases some wild-born translocated) mountain gazelles, dormice and some Eurasian otters reproduced successfully and female Arabian oryx reproduced successfully regardless of prior breeding experience. A controlled study in Italy found that released captive-born Apennine chamois reproduced in similar numbers to wild-caught translocated chamois.
Survival (24 studies): Four of three controlled studies (two replicated) and two reviews in Canada, Canada and the USA, Sweden, Italy and across the world found that released captive-bred swift foxes, European otters and mammals from a review of 49 studies had lower post-release survival rates than did wild-born translocated animals. The other study found that released captive-born Apennine chamois survived in similar numbers to wild-caught translocated chamois. Three studies (one replicated) in the USA and Canada found that released captive-born Key Largo woodrats, Vancouver Island marmots and swift fox pups had lower survival rates than wild-born, wild-living animals. One of the studies also found that Vancouver Island marmots released at two years old were more likely to survive than those released as yearlings. Eleven studies (three replicated) in Italy, Sweden, the UK, Estonia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the USA found that following the release of captive-bred (and in some cases some wild-born translocated) animals, Arabian oryx, populations of European otters, European mink and mountain gazelle survived for 2-11 years, roe deer and over a third of brush-tailed rock-wallabies, black-footed ferrets and brown hares survived for 0.5-24 months and dormice populations survived three months to over seven years. A review in Australia found that release programmes for macropod species resulted in successful establishment of populations in 61% of cases and that 40% survived over five years, and another review in Australia found that over half of programmes were considered successful. Two studies and a review in the USA, USA and Mexico and South Africa found that over 40% of released captive-bred American black bears were killed or had to be removed, only one of 10 oribi survived over two years and that most black-footed ferret releases were unsuccessful at maintaining a population.

2477: Thin trees to reduce wildfire risk
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through fire suppression, some forest areas have become denser than was the case under natural fire regimes. To reduce fuel loads and associated wildfire risk, trees may be thinned. By creating a more open woodland structure, this may encourage growth of herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees at lower levels, thus potentially providing increased resources for mammalian herbivores.
See also Biological resource use - Thin trees within forest, in which thinning is usually done for extraction of merchantable timber though reducing fuel loads may sometimes be a secondary motivation.

Background information and definitions:
Ultrasonic noise is sound waves at higher frequencies than those audible to humans. Different mammal species can detect sound at different ranges of frequencies, so some ultrasonic noises may be audible to a range of mammal species. If ultrasonic noises can deter animals from damaging crops, this could reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of such species.

2480: Remove mid-storey vegetation in forest
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through fire suppression, some forest areas have developed denser mid-storey vegetation (trees at intermediate height between the ground layer and the forest canopy) than was formerly the case. To reduce wildfire risk and for habitat restoration purposes, mid-storey vegetation may be removed either mechanically or through prescribed burning. This intervention considered specifically manual or mechanical removal of mid-storey vegetation and how this may affect forest mammals.

2482: Remove understorey vegetation in forest
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through fire suppression, some forest areas have developed denser understorey vegetation than was the case under natural fire regimes. To reduce fuel loads and associated wildfire risk, understorey vegetation may be removed. Prescribed burning is one option for doing this, but the rapid habitat change that this causes, together with potential loss of food resources and shelter, could negatively impact forest floor mammals. This intervention, therefore, considers specifically manual or mechanical removal of understorey vegetation as an alternative to prescribed burning, and how this affects forest mammals.

Background information and definitions:
In response to reduced availability of natural water sources for mammals, artificial water holes may be constructed. These can help to enhance survival during drought periods. However, there are also concerns about negative effects on mammals from artificial waterholes, such as there being increased numbers of some common water-dependent species at expense of rarer herbivores (Smuts 1978), or that artificial waterholes maintain high populations that are then vulnerable to starvation (Walker at al. 1987).

2485: Translocate crop raiders away from crops (e.g. elephants) to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Where wild mammals cause unacceptable damage to crops, they may be translocated from their point of capture and released some distance away. The release site may be an area away from where agricultural crops are grown. The intervention can fail if translocated animals continue to raid crops or if survival of translocated animals is low. If the intervention succeeds, it may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals. Several other interventions cover translocations that are primarily for conservation of rare or threatened species, such as Translocate to re-establish or boost populations in native range.

2486: Use negative stimuli to deter consumption of livestock feed by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Livestock feed might also attract wild herbivores. This could produce a financial cost to farmers, through added feed costs and through transmission of disease, such as bovine tuberculosis, between wild and domestic herbivores (Phillips et al. 2003). Disease transmission may be greater where animals share foodstuffs. Hence, if wild herbivores can be effectively deterred from accessing livestock feed, this may reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of wild herbivores.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Conflicts between farmers and free-ranging elephants occur in parts of Africa. Farmers on small plots may loose large proportions of their crops to raids by elephants. Some elephants are said to be wary of foraging near African honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata (Vollrath & Douglas-Hamilton 2002). Thus, fences comprising bee hives linked by wires may deter entry to fields by elephants, as well as providing a further potential crop (honey) for farmers. If successful, the intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of elephants.

Restoration of former mining sites usually involves establishing native or non-native plants, often with the main aim of reducing erosion or reducing the concentration of pollutants (Wong 2003). However, this restoration may also benefit mammal species found in and around former mining sites by creating habitat conditions similar to those found prior to mining operations.

One study found that species richness was lower in restored compared to in unmined areas. A replicated, controlled study in Australia found that thinning trees and burning vegetation as part of mine restoration did not increase small mammal species richness. A replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that restored mine areas were recolonized by a range of mammal species within 10 years.

Among mammals, non-native carnivores, typically transported by early European settlers, are especially a threat through predation of native species, including mammals, in locations with few native carnivore species. Non-native herbivores can have dramatic habitat impacts, and thus alter suitability of locations or food availability for native species. Control of non-native species can be expensive and benefits may be difficult to maintain, except in island situations where total elimination might be achievable. Nonetheless, actions aimed at reducing populations of non-native mammals may be carried out on an ongoing basis for the benefit of native species, including mammals.
See also: Remove/control non-native mammals within a fenced area and Remove or control predators.

Key Messages:

Twenty-five studies evaluated the effects on non-controlled mammals of removing or controlling non-native mammals. Twenty-one studies were in Australia, and one was in each of France, the UK, Equador and the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (24 STUDIES)

Abundance (21 studies): Ten of 18 controlled, before-and-after or site comparison studies, in Australia, found that after controlling red foxes, abundances, densities or trapping frequencies increased for rock-wallaby spp., eastern grey kangaroo, woylie,, brush-tail possum, tammar wallaby, chuditch and quenda. Seven studies found mixed results with increases in some species but not others, increases followed by declines or increases only where cats as well as foxes were controlled. The other study found no increase in bush rat numbers with fox control. One of three replicated, before-and-after studies (including two controlled studies), in Australia, France and Ecuador, found that control of invasive rodents increased numbers of lesser white-toothed shrews and greater white-toothed shrews. One study found that Santiago rice rat abundance declined less with rodent control and one found mixed results, with increased numbers of short-tailed mice at one out of four study sites.
Survival (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in Australia found that controlling red foxes increased survival of juvenile eastern grey kangaroos.
Occupancy/range (3 studies): Three studies (two before-and-after, one controlled), in the UK and Australia, found that after controlling non-native American mink, red foxes and European rabbits, there were increases in ranges or proportions of sites occupied by water vole, common brushtail possum, long-nosed potoroo and southern brown bandicoot and four native small mammal species.

2505: Use predator scent to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild herbivores may be sensitive to scents from predators and may alter their behaviour or visitation rates to a site accordingly (Wikenros et al. 2015). If scents can be deployed artificially, they could reduce crop damage caused by wild herbivores and, hence, reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of these animals.

2507: Captive rear in large enclosures prior to release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive-bred mammals may take time to adapt to conditions in the wild post-release, making them especially vulnerable to predation, starvation and disease. If they are reared in large enclosures, with habitat that resembles natural conditions, they may develop more natural behaviour and be better able to find food and shelter in the wild, compared to those animals reared in smaller pens.

Four studies evaluated the effects of captive rearing mammals in large enclosures prior to release. Two studies were in the USA, one was in Mexico and one was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): A study in Mexico found that peninsular pronghorn taken from the wild and kept in a large enclosure bred successfully and the population increased, providing stock suitable for reintroductions.
Survival (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in USA found that black-footed ferrets reared in outdoor pens had higher post-release survival rates than did ferrets raised indoors. A controlled study in Australia found that Tasmanian devils reared free-range in large enclosures did not have greater post-release survival rates than animals from intensively managed captive-rearing facilities.

2508: Use ‘shock collars’ to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Using electric shock collars on mammalian herbivores is a form of aversive conditioning. A shock is administered if the animal wearing a ‘shock collar’ approaches a pre-determined area, containing a crop. The potential for the technique to be effective may be assessed using captive animals in controlled experimental settings. Whilst not directly assessing the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing crop damage, such studies may provide evidence as to the potential for shock collars to alter animals’ behaviour in a way that could potentially be applied to wild herbivores in crop production areas. If the intervention is successful, it may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention considers specifically studies that assess effectiveness of repellents that are intended to be distasteful to wild mammals. Although some may produce some element of repellent odour, the main effect is generally when they are tasted, such as through licking or biting off vegetation to which it has been applied. Included here are tests of several repellents that are marketed commercially, especially to reduce browsing by herbivores on planted trees. The intervention also covers use of these repellents to deter damage to property.

2510: Use holding pens at release site prior to release of captive-bred mammals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Holding pens at release sites (sometimes termed “soft release”) may be used to enable mammals to become accustomed to new surroundings before release. They are often enclosures containing natural habitat and enabling views of surrounding land. The technique may be employed both for releases of captive-bred mammals and for translocations of wild mammals to new sites, here we focus on the first group.
See also: Use holding pens at release site prior to release of translocated mammals.
This intervention does not include studies that solely document use of pens or enclosures used as part of captive-rearing processes if these are remote from release sites.

Key Messages:

Thirty-one studies evaluated the effects of using holding pens at the release site prior to release of captive-bred mammals. Seven studies were in Australia, and in the USA, four were in the UK, three in Argentina, two in each of Israel, Saudi Arabia and China and one in each of Canada, Namibia, South Africa and Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (30 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): A study in Saudi Arabia found that a population of captive-bred Arabian sand gazelles kept in holding pens prior to release nearly doubled in size over four years. A before-and-after study in China found that following release of captive-bred animals from a pre-release enclosure into the semi-wild (free-roaming in summer, enclosed in winter and provided with food), Przewalski’s horses increased in number.
Reproductive success (10 studies): Eight studies (one replicated) and one review in the UK, Saudi Arabia, the USA, Israel and Australia found that following the use of holding pens prior to release (and in some cases provision of supplementary food), captive-bred Eurasian otters, Arabian sand gazelles, eastern-barred bandicoots, some swift foxes, some red wolves and over 33% of Persian fallow deer reproduced, Arabian gazelles started breeding in the first year and the reproductive success of female Asiatic wild ass increased over 10 years. A study in Australia found that after being kept in a holding pen, all four mammal populations released into an invasive-species-free fenced enclosure reproduced.
Survival (23 studies): One of three studies (two controlled, one replicated) in the UK, Canada and Australia found that using holding pens prior to release of captive-bred (and some translocated) animals resulted in greater post-release survival for water voles compared to animals released directly into the wild. The other two studies found similar survival rates for eastern barred bandicoots and swift foxes compared to animals released directly into the wild. A replicated study in the USA found that captive-bred Allegheny woodrats kept in holding pens prior to release, had higher early survival rates than those not kept in holding pens, but overall survival rates tended to be lower than wild resident woodrats. Three studies in South Africa, USA and Argentina found that released captive-bred (and some translocated) African wild dogs, riparian brush rabbits and guanacos that spent longer in, and in one case in larger, holding pens had a higher survival rate. Three studies (one controlled) in Australia and the USA found that captive-bred animals kept in holding pens prior to release had similar (bridled nailtail wallabies) or lower (black-footed ferret kits) annual survival rate after release to that of wild-born translocated animals and lower (black-footed ferrets) survival rates than resident animals. Ten studies (including one controlled, before-and-after study) and one review in Saudi Arabia, the USA, Argentina, China, Israel, Australia and Germany found that following the use of holding pens prior to release of captive-bred animals (or in some cases captive-reared/rehabilitated, or with provision of supplementary food), four of four mammal populations, 19% of red wolves, Asiatic wild ass, Persian fallow deer, most Arabian sand gazelles, most swift foxes, eastern-barred bandicoots and European mink survived at least 1-10 years, over half of giant anteaters, hare-wallabies and Père David’s deer survived for at least 1.5-6 months. Three studies in Namibia, the USA and Australia found that that following the use of holding pens prior to release of captive-bred or reared animals (some provided with nest boxes and/or supplementary food), red-tailed phascogales, most Mexican wolves and African wild dogs survived less than 6-12 months.
Condition (4 studies): A randomized, controlled study in Australia found that eastern barred bandicoots released after time in holding pens lost a similar proportion of body weight and recovered to a similar weight compared to bandicoots released directly. A controlled study in the UK found that common dormice lost weight after being put into holding pens whereas wild translocated dormice gained weight. A controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that captive-bred rufous hare-wallabies placed in holding pens prior to release lost body condition in holding pens. A before-and-after study in Australia found that captive-bred brush-tailed rock-wallabies placed in a holding pen prior to release maintained good health.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): A controlled study in Argentina found that after being kept in holding pens and provided with supplementary food, released captive-bred giant anteaters were less nocturnal in their activity patterns than released wild-born rehabilitated individuals.

2514: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Tunnels, culverts and underpasses may provide safe road crossing opportunities for mammals. A range of different tunnels can be used, including purpose-built wildlife tunnels, culverts that assist with drainage and which can also be used by wildlife, and large passages beneath elevated road section which may sometimes also be used for local vehicle access.
Underpasses are frequently installed in conjunction with wildlife barrier fencing which funnels animals towards the tunnel and prevents them from accessing the road. For this combined intervention, see Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads. See also Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways.
Studies included here are those where barrier fencing is not installed or not explicitly referred to in the study methods or where at least some underpasses were in unfenced areas. Most studies here report solely on the use of these structures, such as the number of crossings made. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.

Key Messages:

Twenty-five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing tunnels, culverts or underpass under roads. Eight studies were in the USA, four were in Australia, four were in Canada, two were in Spain, one each was in Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea and three were reviews with wide geographic coverage.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Survival (3 studies): A study in South Korea found that road sections with higher underpass density did not have fewer wildlife-vehicle collisions. A review found that most studies recorded no evidence of predation of mammals using crossings under roads. A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that overwinter survival of mountain pygmy-possums increased after an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was installed.

BEHAVIOUR (23 STUDIES)

Use (23 studies): Seventeen of 20 studies (including seven replicated studies and two reviews), in the USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, the Netherlands, and across multiple continents, found that crossing structures beneath roads were used by mammals whilst two studies found mixed results depending on species and one study found that culverts were rarely used as crossings by mammals. One of the studies found that crossing structures were used by two of four species more than expected compared to their movements through adjacent habitats. A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was used by mountain pygmy-possums. A replicated study in Germany found that use of tunnels by fallow deer was affected by tunnel colour and design. A study in the USA found that a range of mammals used culverts, including those with shelves fastened to the sides.
Behaviour change (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after, site comparison study in Australia found that after an artificial rocky corridor, which included two underpasses, was installed, dispersal of mountain pygmy-possums increased.

2518: Provide live natural prey to captive mammals to foster hunting behaviour before release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Predatory mammals held in captivity, either for rearing prior to release or for rehabilitation following injury or illness, may lose or not fully develop natural hunting abilities. This may reduce their chance of survival after release. Providing live prey to such animals in captivity may help them to retain or develop essential hunting skills.

Background information and definitions:
Tunnels, culverts and underpasses may provide safe railway crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different tunnels can be used, often in combination with wildlife barrier fencing which funnels animals towards the tunnel and prevents them from accessing the railway (see Install barrier fencing along railways). Studies summarised within this intervention cover both tunnels created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes (e.g. drainage or farm access) but where information about use of such structures by mammals is included. Studies mostly report on the use of these structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.

2522: Modify culverts to make them more accessible to mammals
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Culverts under roads may be used as crossing routes by mammals. This use reduces collision-associated risks to mammals and to motorists compared with crossings over the road surface. Some culverts may be less suited as crossing routes than others. For example, culverts with water flowing across their entire width may not be used by some mammals whilst tunnel length may also be a barrier to their use. A range of modifications can be made to try to increase culvert suitability for use by wild mammals.

Background information and definitions:
Culverts may be installed under roads to enable drainage. They are sometimes also used by mammals to cross under the road and, in some cases, roadside fencing will be designed to funnel mammals towards culvert entrances. However, some mammals are resistant to passing through tunnels that have water at their base (Serronha et al. 2013). Ledges may be installed on the sides of culverts, above the usual water level, to assist animal passage.

2524: Dig trenches around culverts under roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles can be a large cause of mortality for mammal species (e.g. Forman & Alexander 1998). Underpasses installed beneath roads or drainage culverts may be made accessible to mammals with the intention of increasing connectivity of habitats and reducing the animal-vehicle collision risk associated with crossing the road. A range of means may be employed to help funnel animals towards such crossing points. These are usually fences or similar barrier features to prevent animal crossings. However, trenches may be dug at some sites with the intention of inhibiting crossings, especially of small mammals.

Culverts are often installed under roads to aid or enable drainage whilst underpasses enable movement of traffic or apparatus such as farming machinery. Such passages are sometimes used by animals to make road crossings but many animals may nonetheless cross over the road surface and are then at risk of collision with vehicles. This intervention includes studies where fences are installed or extended specifically in a way designed to encourage animals to use existing passages rather than crossing over the road surface. It includes only studies that specifically assess the effectiveness of fencing in a way that can be separated from that of underpasses. For situations where roadside fencing is installed specifically to prevent animal access to roads, in some cases along with underpasses as part of an integrated road casualty reduction scheme, see Install barrier fencing along roads. See also Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads for studies that assess the combined effectiveness of installing fending and underpasses.
See also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways and Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing fences around existing culverts under roads/railways. Two studies were in the USA one was in Portugal and one was in South Africa.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Survival (3 studies): Two out of three before-and-after studies (including a controlled and a site comparison study), in the USA, Portugal and South Africa, found that installing or enhancing roadside fencing alongside existing culverts reduced mammal road mortality whilst one study found that such fences did not alter mammal road mortality.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that fences installed to funnel animals to existing culverts did not increase culvert use by bobcats.

2526: Install overpasses over roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife overpasses are constructed to provide safe road and rail crossing opportunities for wildlife. A range of different structures can be used as overpasses including purpose-built “green bridges”, on which natural vegetation is established, through to multi-use crossings that are accessible to wildlife. Overpasses are often used in combination with wildlife barrier fences that prevent animals accessing the road and which funnel animals toward the overpasses (see Install barrier fencing along roads and Install barrier fencing along railways). Studies summarised within this intervention cover both overpasses created specifically for wildlife and those that were created for other purposes but where information about use of such structures by mammals is included. Studies mostly report on the use of such structures, such as the number of crossings made, rather than on wider population-level effects of their presence.
See also: Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways and Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads.

Key Messages:

Twenty-two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing overpasses over roads or railways. Seven studies were in Canada, three were in Spain, three were in Australia, two were in Sweden, one each was in the Netherlands, Germany, Croatia and the USA, and three (including two reviews) were conducted across multiple countries.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Survival (4 studies): Four studies (including three before-and-after studies), in Canada, Sweden and Australia, found that overpasses (in combination with roadside fencing) reduced collisions between vehicles and mammals. In two of these studies, data from overpasses and underpasses were combined for analysis.

BEHAVIOUR (21 STUDIES)

Use (21 studies): Nineteen studies, in North America, Europe and Australia, found that overpasses were used by mammals. A wide range of mammals was reported using overpasses, including rodents and shrews, rabbits and hares, carnivores, ungulates, bears, marsupials and short-beaked echidna. A review of crossing structures in Australia, Europe and North America found that overpasses were used by a range of mammals, particularly larger mammal species. A global review of crossing structures (including overpasses) found that all studies reported that the majority of crossings were used by wildlife.

2527: Provide supplementary food during/after release of captive-bred mammals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals that are captive-bred are especially vulnerable immediately after release. At this time, they may struggle to find natural food in an unfamiliar area. Furthermore, if the time they spend looking for food is increased, this may make them more vulnerable to predation. Hence, providing supplementary food at and after the period of release may improve longer term survival prospects.
See also: Provide supplementary food during/after release of translocated mammals.

Key Messages:

Fifteen studies evaluated the effects of providing supplementary food during/after release of captive-bred mammals. Four studies were in Australia, two were in each of the USA, China and Argentina, and one was in each of Poland, the UK, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (14 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Four studies (one replicated, one before-and-after study) and one review in Poland, Oman, China and Australia found that following provision of supplementary food (and in one case water) to released captive-bred animals, populations of European bison increased more than six-fold over 20 years, Arabian oryx increased over 14 years, eastern-barred bandicoots increased for the first five years before declining, Père David's deer increased more than six-fold over 12 years and Przewalski’s horses (enclosed in winter) increased over 11 years.
Reproductive success (9 studies): Eight studies (including two replicated and one before-and-after study) and one review in Poland, the UK, China, the USA, Australia and Saudi Arabia found that following the provision of supplementary food (and in one case water or artificial nests) after release of captive-bred animals, some from holding pens, European bison, European otters, Père David's deer, eastern-barred bandicoots, Przewalski’s horses and some captive-bred red wolves successfully reproduced, Arabian gazelles started breeding in the year following releases and sugar gliders established a breeding population.
Survival (6 studies): Four of six studies (one controlled, before-and-after study) in the UK, USA, Argentina and Australia found that following the provision of supplementary food (and in one case water or nest boxes) after release of captive-bred animals, many from holding pens, 19% of red wolves survived for at least seven years, Eurasian otters survived for at least two years, over half the giant anteaters (some rehabilitated) survived for at least six months and hare-wallabies survived at least two months. Two of the studies found that red-tailed phascogales survived for less than a year and most Mexican wolves survived less than eight months.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): A controlled study in Argentina found that after being provided with supplementary food and kept in holding pens, released captive-bred giant anteaters were less nocturnal in their activity patterns than released wild-born rehabilitated individuals.

2528: Remove/control non-native mammals within a fenced area
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Control of non-native mammals may be carried out to reverse detrimental impacts of such species on native plants and animals. Total elimination of non-native mammals may be difficult or impossible to carry out on a large scale, with control programmes often being confined to small islands, where elimination may be achievable. However, away from islands, a similar benefit might be realised if non-native mammals can be removed from within an area that is fenced to prevent their recolonization.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on native mammals of removing or controlling non-native mammals within a fenced area. This study was in Australia.

Background information and definitions:
Invasive plants can out compete established plant species and alter habitat structure. This may alter resource availability for mammals. Some mammal species may benefit but, for others, invasive plants may reduce available food or shelter or change the nature of the environment such that they are at increased risk of predation. Removal or control of non-native invasive plants may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these effects.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing or controlling non-native invasive plants. Both studies were in the USA.

Background information and definitions:
The impact of non-native predators on native mammals can be more severe than that of native predators (Salo et al. 2007). Non-native predators may also feed on non-native prey and, in some situations, reducing non-native prey availability may lead to reductions in numbers of their non-native predators (Murphy et al. 1998; Mutze et al. 2017).

2533: Provide artificial refuges for prey to evade/escape non-native predators
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention considers use of small scale refuges rather than larger predator-free areas protected by fences. Artificial refuges, such as small shelters in otherwise open landscapes, could provide cover for native mammals to escape predation. Refuges are more often employed for reptile conservation, though at least one study found that they were insufficient to mitigate effects of non-native predators (Lettink et al. 2010). For mammals, refuges might entail small shelters, boxes or artificial burrows.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A range of live-trapping techniques is used in control activities aimed at non-native species. As traps may capture species additional to the targeted non-native species, using live traps enables release of those non-target captures. However, restrained mammals are at risk of suffering injuries prior to being released. This intervention considers cases where modifications might be made to live traps with the intention of reducing such incidental injuries.

2536: Use conditioned taste aversion to prevent non-target species from entering traps
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Animals may be trapped for a variety of reasons. In cases, such as where trapping is aimed at non-native species, a large number of traps might be set across the landscape. If there is a risk of catching non-target species, these will typically be live traps, from which individuals of non-target species can be released. However, trapping of animals usually entails at least some risk of injury to the animal as well as further risks, such as keeping parents away from their young. Furthermore, a trap holding a non-target animal is generally not then available for capturing the target animal until next visited by an operator. Conditioned taste aversion may be attempted, to try to make non-target mammals that are at risk of capture avoid traps because they associate them with an unpleasant taste or sensation.

2539: Reduce pesticide or fertilizer use
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides (including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and fertilizers, used especially in agriculture, but also in horticulture, amenity grassland, gardens and other situations, may have a negative effect on wildlife. Through reducing plant and insect diversity, or through direct toxicity, they may also natively impact mammals. Organic farming, an agricultural system that excludes the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and relies on techniques such as crop rotation, compost and biological pest control, is included within this intervention.

Wildlife crossings over or under roads may be installed to reduce the impact of the road on animal mortality and on habitat fragmentation. They usually take the form of tunnels or bridges of a range of designs. These may not be suitable for use by mammals that move by gliding from tree to tree. Glide poles have been trialled, especially in Australia (e.g. Ball & Goldingay 2008), to provide a means of reconnecting habitat and reducing road mortality for gliding mammal species. Monitoring typically takes the form of documenting use of poles rather than looking at population level effects or impacts on road mortality.

Background information and definitions:
Regular disturbance may maintain vegetation in a desirable, semi-natural state – particularly in early-successional habitats. Removal of vegetation may help to maintain habitats in an early-successional state, which may benefit mammal species that depend on such habitats.
This intervention includes removal of annual vegetation (e.g. herbs and grasses removed by mowing) as well as scrubby vegetation and trees. Tree clearance studies included here are those where woodland had colonised previously open areas and was cleared for conservation purposes, without being part of commercial forest management. For studies of partial clearance in long-established or commercially managed forest, see Biological Resource Use - Clear or open patches in forests.

Key Messages:

Twenty studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing vegetation by hand or machine. Eleven studies were in the USA, and one each was in Canada, South Africa, Israel, Norway, Portugal, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Thailand.

Abundance (11 studies): Eight of 11 site comparison or controlled studies (nine of which were replicated), in the USA, Israel, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, found that clearing woody vegetation or herbaceous and grassland vegetation benefitted target mammals. Population or density increases were recorded for small mammals, European rabbits and Stephens’ kangaroo rat while black-tailed prairie dog and California ground squirrel colonies were larger or denser and Utah prairie dog colonies established better than in uncleared areas. Two studies found mixed results of clearing woody vegetation, with hazel dormouse abundance declining, then increasing and small mammal abundance increasing, then declining in both cleared and uncleared plots alike. One study found no effect of scrub clearance from sand dunes on habitat specialist small mammals.
Survival (1 study): A replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that mechanical disturbance of woody vegetation within forest (combined with reseeding, follow-up herbicide application and further seeding) increased overwinter survival of mule deer fawns.

One study found that clearing woody vegetation promoted increased use by white-tailed deer in some but not all plots, one found that it did not increase use by mule deer and one found that carrying out a second clearance on previously cleared plots did not increase use by white-tailed deer. A before-and-after study in South Africa found that clearing woody vegetation from shrubland increased wildebeest and zebra abundance following subsequent burning but not when carried out without burning whilst other mammals did not show consistent responses.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals undertake long-distance migrations between sites occupied in different seasons. Some routes are used for such migrations by mammal populations over many generations. The availability of these routes may become especially important in the face of climate change, which may alter the duration over which some parts of an animal’s range are suitable. Habitat destruction and fragmentation may make some routes less suited for migrations, but their provision or retention may become increasingly important as climate change drives changes in seasonal land-use or migrations of mammal populations.

2552: Protect habitat along elevational gradients
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Global warming is prompting poleward and uphill shifts in species’ range (e.g. Chen et al. 2011, Myers et al. 2009, Rowe et al. 2010). Species reliant on particular habitats may suffer population declines if they are unable to move towards higher latitudes and if there is no suitable habitat available at higher altitudes. Protecting habitat along elevational gradients may help to enable shifts in range.

2553: Translocate animals from source populations subject to similar climatic conditions
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
As human-induced climate change leads to increasing temperatures, species shift their distributions to higher latitudes and elevations (Hickling et al. 2006). However, some species cannot disperse quickly enough, or may not be able to cross human or man-made barriers (Thomas 2011). This results in some animals being present in areas that represent poor quality habitat, resulting in increased mortality rates that may risk local or even global extinction. One solution that has been suggested for this problem is the translocation of animals to areas where climatic conditions are similar to those formerly found in their natural ranges (Thomas 2011).

2554: Provide dams/water holes during drought
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change may increase the frequency of droughts. Populations of some mammal species that are reliant on availability of water may be buffered against effects of drought by artificial provision of water. This could be through digging holes down to the water table or building dams, to store water for use in times of drought.
For cases where provision of water as an intervention is a response to water shortage caused by other human-induced activities, rather than directly via climate change, see Natural system modifications - Provide artificial waterholes in dry season.

2556: Install rope bridges between canopies
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife crossings over or under roads may be installed to reduce the impact of the road on animal mortality and on habitat fragmentation. They usually take the form of tunnels or bridges of a range of designs. These may not be suitable for use by mammals that spend most of their time higher up within trees. Rope bridges have been trialled, especially in Australia, to provide a means of reconnecting habitat and reducing road mortality for arboreal mammal species. Monitoring typically takes the form of documenting use of crossings rather than looking at population level effects or impacts on road mortality.

2557: Remove flood water
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events, including flooding. Flood waters may cover habitat normally used by mammal species. For example, more than half of China’s mammal species were found to be exposed to risks from flooding (Ameca y Juárez & Jiang 2016). In addition to direct casualties from effects of water (such as drowning) flood water may alter the habitat, for example through changes to vegetation. Furthermore, mammal mortality may be higher when flood water persists for longer (Wuczyński & Jakubiec 2013). Enabling rapid removal of flood water, such as through creating drainage routes, may lessen such impacts.

2558: Install one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fencing alongside roads can prevent or reduce mammal access to roads and, thus, reduce vehicle collisions with mammals. However, mammals that do manage to access roads, either around fence ends or through defective sections of fence, can then become trapped on the road. One-way gates are intended to allow escape of such mammals from the road whilst not enabling additional animals to access the road. Other structures can serve a similar purpose, such as ramps up to fence-top height at one side.
See also: Install barrier fencing along roads.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways. All seven studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Survival (5 studies): Two before-and-after studies (one replicated), in the USA, found that barrier fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. One of two studies (one before-and-after and one replicated, controlled), in the USA, found that barrier fencing with escape gates along roads with one or more underpasses reduced moose-vehicle collisions, whilst the other found no reduction in total mammal road casualty rates. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in USA found that earth escape ramps reduced mammal road mortalities.

2559: Legally protect habitat for mammals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Legally protecting habitat may reduce its conversion and degradation by humans. This may in turn increase the abundance and diversity of mammals that make use of that habitat.
Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas is particularly difficult. For example, protected and unprotected areas might start off with different quality habitats (protection being granted to the best quality habitat). Protected areas are also more likely to be in remote areas, so less accessible to threats such as harvesting (Joppa & Pfaff 2009). Finally, effectiveness is best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors influence the ecosystem. The most reliable studies would compare protected and unprotected areas over time, and possibly correct for some of the biases.

One of three site comparison studies, in Tanzania, Brazil and India, found that populations of more mammal species increased inside protected areas than in adjacent unprotected areas. One study found that populations of only three of 11 species were higher on protected than on unprotected land whilst the third study found that 13 of 16 species were less abundant in a protected area than in a nearby unprotected area.

Background information and definitions:
Most land is privately-owned by individuals or businesses. Whilst most of this land is not managed for wildlife conservation, some areas are operated as private nature reserves (e.g. Lanhholz 1996), or as part of larger protected areas, including corridors and buffer zones (e.g. Environmental Law Institute 2003, Figgis 2004). On other land, a wide range of individual actions may be taken to promote or conserve wildlife. The effectiveness of these individual actions is covered under those specific interventions. This intervention more generally considers the effectiveness of promoting habitat conservation among private landowners.

2561: Build fences around protected areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fences may be constructed around protected areas to keep out poachers or predators, including invasive species (e.g. Hayward & Kerley 2009). They may also prevent other potentially damaging incursions, such as by off-road vehicles that may damage habitat, or casual entry by people on foot who may disturb mammals. Where protected areas are surrounded by land in which there are greater threats to wild mammals, such as persecution of carnivores, fences may reduce losses of such species by preventing them encountering these threats. Possible disadvantages of fences include inhibiting species’ dispersal, potentially leading to reductions in genetic diversity.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Protected areas are usually subject to the influence of activities in surrounding areas. Buffer zones around core habitat in protected areas are usually areas of land which do not receive full protection and are not subject to the same management intensity of core areas, but on which there may be some degree of limit to activities such as hunting, agriculture and development. In some cases, buffer zones themselves can provide additional habitat for mammals (Paolino et al. 2016) though this can also expose them to a higher level of human-related threats (van der Meer et al. 2013).

Background information and definitions:
Large protected areas may be better able to support viable populations of mammals than are smaller areas. However, protected area effectiveness may also be linked to sites being surrounded by similar habitat, having strong public support, effective law enforcement, low human population densities and sufficient financial resources (Struhsaker et al. 2005). Where these are not in place, factors such as activities of surrounding human populations may have a greater impact on species survival (Parks & Harcourt 2002).

2567: Install barrier fencing along roads
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife barrier fencing aims to prevent animals from crossing roads. They are typically wire mesh fences 2–2.5 m high running parallel to the road. Although fencing may protect wildlife from traffic, it should not create an absolute barrier that prevents migration, isolates populations, fragments habitat, or causes injuries. Wildlife fencing is therefore usually combined with safe crossing opportunities such as wildlife underpasses and overpasses (see Install overpasses over roads/railways, Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under railways, Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads). Wildlife escapes, such as one-way gates, are often integrated with wildlife fencing to allow animals that do manage to cross the fence to escape from the fenced road (see: Install one-way gates or other structures to allow wildlife to leave roadways). Wildlife such as deer frequently try to pass through holes in fences and so fences must be well maintained (Ward 1982).
Studies included here are those that specifically assess fence effectiveness, sometimes in combination with other collision reduction actions, but not where effects of fencing cannot be separated from effects of road underpasses. For these interventions combined, see Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads.
As well as the threat to wildlife from vehicles, fencing is often placed to reduce dangers and costs to motorists that can result from collisions with wildlife. Assessment of whether or not to install fences may be based on a cost-benefit analysis (e.g. Huijser 2009).

Two before-and-after studies, in the USA, found that roadside fencing with one-way gates to allow escape from the road, reduced the number of collisions between vehicles and deer. A study in the USA found that a 2.7-m-high fence did not reduce road-kills of white-tailed deer compared to a 2.2-m-high fence. A controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that barrier fencing with designated crossing points did not significantly reduce road deaths of mule deer. A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Canada found that electric fences, (along with an underpass beneath one highway), reduced moose-vehicle collisions. A review of fencing studies from USA, Canada and Sweden, found that longer fencing along roadsides led to a greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars than did shorter fence sections.

2571: Install barrier fencing and underpasses along roads
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Schemes designed to reduce collisions between vehicles and wild mammals may use multiple interventions. Two of the most common ones, installing barrier fencing and providing routes for mammals to travel underneath roads, are often employed within the same scheme. This may entail regular roadside fencing with entrances to underpasses set further back away from the road or fencing may be designed to adjoin the sides of underpass entrances. Sometimes, fencing may be installed to form a funnel leading towards underpass entrances.
This intervention includes studies where these two actions are in place at the same site. In most studies, all underpasses (where there are multiple crossings) are beneath stretches or roads that have barrier fencing. In a minority, just some of the underpasses monitored are along stretches with barrier fencing. Studies included use of either conventional fencing, electric fences or other barriers, such as walls. Most studies report solely on the use of crossings or trends in numbers of mammals killed on roads. There is an absence of studies reporting on wider population-level effects of the presence of these structures.
See Install tunnels/culverts/underpass under roads for studies where underpasses are either installed without use of barrier fencing or where it is not clear from the study that barrier fencing was installed. See also Install barrier fencing along roads for studies which, in some cases, included underpasses but where the specific effect of fencing was evaluated.

Key Messages:

Fifty-five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing barrier fencing and underpasses along roads. Twenty-seven were in the USA, nine were in Canada, seven were in Australia, two each were in Spain, Portugal, the UK and Sweden, one each was in Denmark, Germany and Croatia and one was a review covering Australia, Europe and North America.

POPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)

Survival (15 studies): Eleven of 15 studies (including 12 before-and-after studies and two site comparisons), in the USA, Australia, Sweden and Canada, found that installing underpasses and associated roadside barrier fencing reduced collisions between vehicles and mammals. Three studies found that the roadkill rate was not reduced and one study found that vehicle-mammal collisions continued to occur after installation.

BEHAVIOUR (52 STUDIES)

Use (52 studies): Seventeen of 18 studies (including 10 before-and-after studies) in the USA, Canada and Sweden, which reported exclusively on ungulates, found that underpasses installed along with roadside barrier fencing were used by a range of ungulate species. These were mule deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, white-tailed deer, elk, moose and Florida Key deer. The other study found that underpasses were not used by moose whilst one of the studies that did report use by ungulates further reported that they were not used by white-tailed deer. Further observations from these studies included that elk preferred more open, shorter underpasses to those that were enclosed or longer, underpass use was not affected by traffic levels and that mule deer used underpasses less than they used overpasses. Thirty-four studies (including four before-and-after studies, seven replicated studies, three site comparisons and two reviews), in the USA, Canada, Australia, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Croatia and across multiple continents, that either studied mammals other than ungulates or multiple species including ungulates, found that underpasses in areas with roadside fencing were used by mammals. Among these studies, one found that small culverts were used by mice and voles more than were larger underpasses, one found that bandicoots used underpasses less after they were lengthened and one found that culverts were used by grizzly bears less often than were overpasses.

2572: Restore or create wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Wetland habitats are often drained or degraded during the development of agriculture or expansion of urban areas or other land uses. Restoration of these wetland habitats can help to increase local species richness and abundance of mammal species that depend on wetlands.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating wetlands. Three studies were in the USA and one was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Community composition (1 study): A site comparison study in the USA found that the composition of mammal species present differed between a created and a natural wetland.
Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (one replicated) in the USA, found that mammal species richness did not differ between created and natural wetlands.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that following marshland restoration, muskrat abundance increased.
Survival (1 study): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK, found that water voles persisted better in wetlands that were partially restored using mechanical or manual methods than they did in wetlands undergoing complete mechanical restoration.

2573: Sterilize predators
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Predators can limit population sizes of prey species. Changes in habitat or land management can lead to increases in predator populations which might negatively affect prey. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproduction success of prey species. Sterilization of predators may be proposed as an alternative strategy that may be regarded as being more acceptable than removal or lethal control.

Background information and definitions:
The range occupied by a species may be limited by the presence of competitors. In many cases, removing native competitors may be a controversial management strategy. However, abundance increases or range expansion of a competitor species, due to habitat or land management changes, may motivate removal or control of this species if its presence negatively impacts on another species that is deemed to be a higher conservation priority.

Corridors are areas of natural habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones; Rouget et al. 2006). They may enable animals to disperse and migrate between intact habitat patches, which may increase their chances of survival. They may be particularly important in landscapes where there is relatively little remaining natural habitat.

Background information and definitions:
Domestic animals may present a range of problems for wild mammals. These can include predation (e.g. Woods et al. 2013), disease transmission and hybridization between closely related species (Nussberger et al. 2014). Culling (especially feral animals) may be an option for reducing these threats but can be controversial on animal rights or animal welfare grounds. Sterilizing such animals is an alternative strategy that may reduce impacts of non-native species in the longer term and may also be possible to achieve on a large scale among domestic animals, by liaising with their owners.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Treatment of diseases in wild mammals can be problematic. It can be difficult to diagnose causes of illness and the administration of medicines directly to target individuals can be challenging. Except in cases of highly threatened species, treatment of disease in wild mammals is usually only carried out when there are potential economic costs of not treating, such as a risk of transmission to domestic animals or reductions in numbers or health of animals that have sporting value. This intervention includes cases where animals are confined for treatment (and one study on captive animals that trials a delivery mechanism for treatments that might be administered to wild mammals) but in all cases, the aim is to improve the health of wild populations.

Background information and definitions:
Some mammals use cavities in trees for denning, roosting or breeding. Woodland management for timber extraction may disproportionately remove trees that are sufficiently mature to have developed such cavities. Nest boxes, usually made of wood and attached to tree trunks, may provide an environment that mimics natural tree cavities and is adopted by such mammals. This intervention includes creation of artificial cavities within the tree, by excavating a quantity of wood and replacing a front plate with a constricted opening.
This intervention specifically includes artificial dens or nest boxes in or on trees. For provision of structures in other situations, see Provide artificial refuges/breeding sites.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Culling is a well-established approach for the management of some diseases in domestic animals, and although it has been used in an attempt to eliminate disease or reduce rates of transmission in a range of wild mammal species (Carter et al. 2009), the culling of diseased wild mammals for conservation is rarely attempted, probably due to ethical and ecological considerations (Woodroffe 1999). Nonetheless, prompt culling of all animals in an area might have potential to control or eliminate disease outbreaks and reduce longer-term negative impacts of disease on populations (McCallum 2008).

High levels of parasites in wild mammals may reduce fitness and lead to higher levels of mortality (e.g. Cooper et al. 2012). Drugs are readily available to reduce infestation levels of a wide range of parasites, though they are more frequently used to treat domestic animals. Attempts to treat wild mammals are most likely to be made where there is specific economic value to the wild mammal, such as among species that are valued for sporting purposes. In such cases, drug treatments may be administered through adding to baits or supplementary food left for animals.

Although the effects of parasites, such as ticks, fleas and lice, on their hosts are often undetectable, there can be serious adverse health effects of high parasite burdens, including reduced reproductive output and increased mortality (Wall 2007). Furthermore, in some cases, parasites can be carriers of disease that can have severe adverse effects on populations (e.g. Biggins & Kosoy 2001).

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Reflectors are installed on posts along the edge of the road, a certain distance apart and at the height of the average vehicle headlamp. At night, as vehicle lights approach, the reflectors glow brighter and create an “optical fence” as light from headlights is reflected onto roadside habitat, which aims to deter wildlife from approaching the road until the vehicle has passed. Polished stainless steel wildlife mirrors can also be installed to reflect the headlights from passing cars causing light to flicker sharp, pencil-like beams that aim to startle animals and stop them moving until the lights have passed.

This intervention covers prohibiting or restricting hunting specifically where hunting is the major threat to a population of a species. For legal protection aimed at other threats see Habitat protection - Legally protect habitat for mammals.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of prohibiting or restricting hunting of a mammal species. One study each was in Norway, the USA, South Africa, Poland and Zimbabwe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): Two studies (including one before-and-after study), in the USA and Poland, found that prohibiting hunting led to population increases of tule elk and wolves.
Survival (3 studies): A before-and-after study in Norway found that restricting or prohibiting hunting did not alter the number of brown bears killed. A study in Zimbabwe reported that banning the hunting, possession and trade of Temminck’s ground pangolins did not eliminate hunting of the species. A before-and-after study in South Africa found that increasing legal protection of leopards, along with reducing human-leopard conflict by promoting improved animal husbandry, was associated with increased survival.

2598: Install traffic calming structures to reduce speeds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the design speed of a road can be used to reduce vehicle speed rather than reducing the legal speed limit. Traffic calming methods include speed bumps, rumble strips, curb or pavement extensions (to reduce road width) and raised central medians/islands. Such structures get the attention of drivers and encourage them to slow down, which may help to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions can be employed to in an attempt to reduce the animal-vehicle collision rate. One option may be to cut back vegetation along roadsides in areas with high collision rates. This could give motorists a clearer sight of animals at the roadside ahead and, hence, more chance to take avoiding action if they see an animal moving onto the road.

Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles can be a major cause of mortality for wild mammals and, especially where larger mammal species are involved, a cause of injury, death and economic loss for motorists (Conover et al. 1995). A range of interventions can be employed to in an attempt to reduce the animal-vehicle collision rate. One option may be to modify the roadside environment to make it less attractive to mammals. This could involve removing vegetation that provides mammals with feeding or shelter resources, planting vegetation that is unattractive to mammals or removing other roadside features that are known to attract mammals and create accident hotspots.

Background information and definitions:
Animals killed on roads provide a food source for scavengers and some predators. These scavengers and predators then become vulnerable to being killed in collisions with vehicles themselves. Removing carcasses of road-killed animals thus removes a source of attraction towards roads for these species.

Background information and definitions:
Wild mammals may be at increased risk of collisions with trains if they spend time on or close to the railway. Vegetation alongside railways may provide a feeding resource that attracts animals while, at the same time, obscuring views of oncoming trains. Removing vegetation in areas with high recorded collision rates may reduce attractiveness of such areas to mammals and, thus, reduce the risk of collision with trains.

2606: Fit vehicles with ultrasonic warning devices
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Collisions between mammals such as deer and vehicles can result in death or injury to animals and humans alike. For example, it has been estimated that over 1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually in the USA alone (Conover et al. 1995). Wildlife warning whistles are designed to produce high frequency, ultrasonic noises to alert or frighten animals away from oncoming vehicles. Whistles can be mounted on vehicles, with the sound being emitted once the vehicle reaches a certain speed. Alternatively whistles can be mounted on poles or small trees along roads and be activated by headlights of approaching cars.

Background information and definitions:
Management of wildlife species that are regarded as game animals may involve setting hunting quotas that are designed to enable the population to reach or remain at a particular level. Whilst many hunting systems use quotas, the studies included here are those based on mammal species with particular local conservation concerns rather than where quotas are based purely on maximising the harvest.

2608: Install signage to warn motorists about wildlife presence
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wildlife crossing signs alert drivers to the potential presence of wildlife on or near a road. They encourage drivers to be more alert and/or reduce the speed of their vehicle, with the goal of reducing animal-vehicle collisions. Motorists may become habituated to signs if they are present all year round, are too common or look similar to other signs. Solutions may be to use temporary seasonal signs, animated signs, flashing lights or flags to catch the attention of drivers. Animal detection warning systems have sensors that detect large animals on or near the road that are wired to flashing signs.
Studies that investigate the effect on vehicle speed of warning signs are not included here if they do not report relevant metrics on vehicle-mammal collision rates (e.g. Lehnert & Bissonette 1997; Al-Ghamdi & AlGadhi 2004) though information on changes in motorists’ speed is reported here if the study also reports collision rates.

Background information and definitions:
Within some hunted populations of mammals, certain age or sex classes are favoured targets for hunters. This can result in altered population structures which can be detrimental to breeding success for example (e.g. Torres-Porras et al. 2014). Management of game mammals may, therefore, involve imposing specific hunting restrictions, so as to reduce or prohibit harvests of particular sex or age classes.

2610: Incentivise species protection through licensed trophy hunting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Trophy hunting is the hunting of wild animals for recreation. Usually, this involves large or otherwise distinguished animals, such as large carnivores, or species with large antlers. The animal, or part of it, is kept by the hunter, often for display. Trophy hunting may provide financial support to local communities or conservation initiatives, through locally levied fees (Di Minin et al. 2016). This may increase the perceived value of maintaining populations of such species in the long term and may, hence, incentivise greater habitat and species protection in such areas.

Background information and definitions:
Hunting using traps (such as snares, leg-hold traps or cage traps) can result in capture of rare, threatened or protected non-target species mammal (e.g. Andreasen et al. 2018). Measures to reduce such “bycatch” might include setting a weight-sensitive release catch, placing traps in particular areas (or avoiding other areas) or only using specific baits.

2613: Remove or control predators
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Predators can limit population sizes of prey species. Changes in habitat or land management can lead to increases in predator populations which might negatively affect prey. Removing or controlling predators, especially native predators, for the benefit of their wild prey species can be a controversial management strategy. In many situations, it is more likely to occur for game management than directly for species conservation. Nonetheless, there is potential for such management to lead to increases in the abundance, survival or reproduction success of prey species.

Key Messages:

Ten studies evaluated the effects on non-controlled mammals of removing or controlling predators. Seven studies were in North America, one was in Finland, one in Portugal and one in Mexico.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (10 STUDIES)

Abundance (6 studies): Three of six studies (including three controlled, one before-and-after and one replicated, paired sites study), in Finland Portugal, Mexico and the USA, found that removing predators increased abundances of pronghorns, moose and European rabbits and Iberian hares. One of these studies also found that mule deer abundance did not increase. The other three studies found that removing predators did not increase mountain hare, caribou or desert bighorn sheep abundance.
Reproductive success (2 studies): Two replicated, before-and-after studies (one also controlled), in the USA, found that predator removal was associated with increased breeding productivity of white-tailed deer and less of a productivity decline in pronghorns. However, one of these studies also found that there was no change in breeding productivity of mule deer.
Survival (5 studies): Two of five before-and-after studies (including two controlled studies and one replicated study), in the USA, Canada and the USA and Canada combined, found that controlling predators did not increase survival of caribou calves, or of calf or adult female caribou. Two studies found that moose calf survival and woodland caribou calf survival increased with predator control. The other study found mixed results with increases in white-tailed deer calf survival in some but not all years with predator control.

2616: Use alternative de-icers on roads
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Use of chloride salts as de-icers along roads in winter can attract wildlife and may therefore increase vehicle-wildlife collisions, particularly in areas without natural salt licks. The main de-icers used by highway agencies are chloride-based salts such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or acetate-based de-icers such as potassium, sodium or calcium magnesium acetate. Reducing the amount of salt used or using alternative de-icers without salt, particularly in areas with high vehicle-wildlife collision rates, may reduce the attractiveness of roadsides to wildlife.
A study in Canada found that filling roadside salt pools with rocks (thus rendering them unavailable as salt-lick sources) reduced the number and duration of visits by moose Alces alces (Leblond et al. 2007; see Modify the roadside environment to reduce collisions by reducing attractiveness of road verges to mammals).

Banning importation of non-native mammals for sporting purposes could reduce or prevent further such threats.

2623: Promote sustainable alternative livelihoods
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conserving biodiversity and eliminating poverty are linked global challenges. The poor, particularly the rural poor, depend on nature for many elements of their livelihoods, including food, fuel, shelter and medicines. By promoting sustainable alternative livelihoods, and/or livelihood diversification, the aim is to provide or encourage other sources of income that reduce pressure on natural resources, such as mammals, to sustainable levels. There is a wide diversity of potential alternative sources of income, which depend on the situation, but include activities such as the development of other small scale productions systems, eco-tourism or craft work for example. Working alongside people who will ultimately benefit from conservation can build social capital, improve accountability, reduce poverty and result in more effective biodiversity conservation.

Background information and definitions:
Watching mammals as a recreational activity and has grown considerably in popularity over recent years (Dinets & Hall 2018) with nature-based tourism in general increasing in most countries (Balmford et al. 2009). This may result in conservation benefits, such as increased revenue to local conservation projects and assistance with collection of data. Negative impacts can include disturbance pressures at popular sites or increased development to support tourism-related activities. Assessing the net benefits of mammal-related ecotourism may be hampered by lack of population data (Buckley et al. 2016).

2625: Ban exports of hunting trophies
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Trophy hunting is the hunting of wild animals for recreation. Usually, this involves large or otherwise distinguished animals, such as large carnivores, or species with large antlers. The animal, or part of it, is kept by the hunter, often for display. Some trophy hunting provides financial support to local communities or conservation, through locally levied fees (Minin et al. 2016). However, permitting exports of hunting trophies (often from developing countries to developed countries) may provide incentives for hunting at unsustainable levels (Lindsey et al. 2016) or may provide a route for importing illegally hunted trophies. Bans on trophy hunting exports are designed to remove this incentive and, hence, reduce incentives for the hunting of relevant species.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A range of mammals, including rodents and ungulates, can cause substantial damage to trees, especially young trees, through browsing activities on foliage and by stripping bark from trees. As well as damage to natural habitats, this can cause financial losses to the forestry industry (Huitu et al. 2009). In an attempt to reduce such conflict, trees may be protected from attack using a range of barriers to prevent mammals from accessing them. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control on these mammals.

2635: Coppice trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing is a management practice typical of Eurasian northern temperate zone deciduous woodlands and wood pastures, in which stems of tree species, such as hazel Corylus avellana and sweet chestnut Castanea sativa, are cut near ground level once every few years, often in defined coppice compartments. These then regrow from the cut ‘stool’ giving a sustainable yield of woody material harvested on a rotational basis. Coppicing maintains a mosaic of woodland areas with differing amounts of daylight reaching the forest floor and, therefore, promotes a variety of ground vegetation conditions. This may benefit mammals that require either open canopy woodland or a mix of open and more closed woodland in close proximity. Coppicing has declined over the last century and some former coppice woodlands are no longer actively managed.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of coppicing trees on mammals.

2637: Use selective harvesting instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Clearcutting of large areas of forest can have substantial impacts on associated fauna. Selective logging is the removal of selected trees within a forest based on criteria such as diameter, height or species. Remaining trees are left in the stand, as opposed to clearcutting where all trees are felled. This intervention is similar to several others that involve harvesting some, but not all, trees. In this case, tree removal was largely based on forestry specifications, rather than designed spatially to retain undisturbed patches. This intervention covers a wide range of tree removal intensities. In some cases, management is for shelterwood, a specific forestry practice that involves gradually removing mature trees to allow growing space for younger trees that initially germinate in partial shade.

Background information and definitions:
Removing trees, through clearcutting or clearfelling, can have substantial, usually negative, effects on forest mammals, through alteration of habitat and removal of food and shelter. Patch retention is the act of leaving groups of trees during harvesting, which may act as refugia to support forest fauna and enable its recolonisation of the remainder of the forest as it regrows.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
When timber harvesting or woodland management operations take place, trees may be clearfelled across a large area, thinned throughout the woodland or cut in patches, leaving surrounding forest unharvested. Felling in groups will produce a lower timber harvest than clearfelling but will leave more forest unaffected, which may help to sustain populations of some species. It will also affect less of the woodland area overall than does thinning of trees or selecting individual trees scattered throughout the forest to fell.

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of applying fertilizer to trees. All three studies were in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): One of three replicated studies (including one controlled study and two site comparison studies), in Canada, found that thinned forest stands to which fertilizer was applied were used more by snowshoe hares in winter but not in summer over the short-term. The other studies found that forest stands to which fertilizer was applied were not more used by snowshoe hares in the longer term or by mule deer or moose.

2650: Thin trees within forest
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Thinning is a forestry operation that involves removing some trees in order to allow remaining trees to grow faster, or straighter or otherwise to produce better quality timber. It may especially be applied in young forest, a few years after onset of regeneration or planting. Thinning increases light that reaches the forest floor, potentially adding to habitat diversity, and may enable remaining trees to produce higher quality forage for herbivores.
The evidence summarised for this intervention includes one case where trees were selectively thinned to increase overwinter browse availability for deer and one where combinations of thinning and felling of groups of trees were combined. See also Use thinning of forest instead of clearcutting.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects on mammals of thinning trees within forests. Six studies were in Canada and six were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Species richness (2 studies): A replicated, site comparison study the USA found that in thinned tree forest stands, there was similar mammal species richness compared to in unthinned stands. A replicated, controlled study  in Canada found that thinning of regenerating lodgepole pine did not increase small mammal species richness 12–14 years later.

POPULATION RESPONSE (8 STUDIES)

Abundance (8 studies): Three of eight replicated, controlled and replicated, site comparison studies, in the USA and Canada, found that thinning trees within forests lead to higher numbers of small mammals. Two studies showed increases for some, but not all, small mammal species with a further study showing an increase for one of two squirrel species in response to at least some forest thinning treatments. The other two studies showed no increases in abundances of small mammals or northern flying squirrels between 12 and 14 years after thinning.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): Three of four controlled and comparison studies (three also replicated, one randomized) in Canada found that thinning trees within forests did not lead to greater use of areas by mule deer, moose or snowshoe hares. The other study found that a thinned area was used more by white-tailed deer than was unthinned forest.

2651: Retain wildlife corridors in logged areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Corridors are areas of habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones) that enable species to disperse and migrate through the landscape. In a managed forest environment, corridors may enable recolonization of isolated forest blocks. This intervention includes corridors of natural unharvested vegetation and of cover provided by arrangement of felling debris.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining wildlife corridors in logged areas. One study was in Australia and one was in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): A replicated study in Australia found that corridors of trees, retained after harvesting, supported seven species of arboreal marsupial. A replicated, controlled study in Canada found that lines of woody debris through clearcut areas that were connected to adjacent forest were not used more by red-backed voles than were isolated lines of woody debris.

2652: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retained riparian forest buffer strips can help to shield waterways from potentially negative impacts of tree harvesting, such as sedimentation. Such retained habitat may also enable persistence of forest mammals following clearfelling (Hannon et al. 2002).
Hannon S.J., Paszkowski C.A., Boutin S., DeGroot J., Macdonald S.E., Wheatley M. & Eaton B.R. (2002) Abundance and species composition of amphibians, small mammals, and songbirds in riparian forest buffer strips of varying widths in the boreal mixedwood of Alberta. Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 32, 1784–1800.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvesting.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.

2653: Gather coarse woody debris into piles after felling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches that are left during tree harvesting. Gathering coarse woody debris into piles, either at a single point or as a line of debris across the forest floor, can increase structural diversity on a forest scale relative to evenly spreading the material.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of gathering coarse woody debris into piles after felling. Both studies were in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in Canada found higher mammal species richness where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in Canada found higher counts of San Bernardino long-tailed voles where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles. The other study found higher small mammal abundance at one of three plots where debris was gathered into piles.
