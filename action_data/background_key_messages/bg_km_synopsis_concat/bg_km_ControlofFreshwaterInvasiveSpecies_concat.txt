1029: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Trapping and removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Traps are commercially available for crayfish capture. They are typically baited with food items and set overnight, after which crayfish are disposed of in a humane way. A number of studies have investigated the use of trapping to control other invasive crayfish species. A replicated study from the UK (Holdich & Black 2007) found that trapping spiny-cheeked crayfish Orconectes limosus was ineffective at managing populations. Another before and after study in Spain (Dana et al. 2010) demonstrated that a combination of trapping, manual removal and electrofishing controlled recruitment of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus.  However, trapping contributed towards only approximately 3% of the total crayfish removed in this Spanish study.

Key Messages:

One controlled, replicated study in Italy found that baiting traps with food (tinned meat) trapped the most red swamp crayfish compared to the use of male and female pheromones or the control (no bait). Over half of all crayfish caught were found in traps baited with food.

1030: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Encouraging predators
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
High levels of predation, especially from fish, may help to reduce crayfish population density. A study of red swamp crayfish introduced to Portugal (Correia 2001) found that mammal predators included red fox, otter, common genet and Egyptian mongoose but not weasel, polecat, stone marten, badger or wild cat. The study reported important bird predators as night heron and white stork, and to a lesser extent little egret, purple heron and grey heron.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Crayfish are omnivores. Removing food items from their environment has the potential to reduce growth rates and survival and could lead to mortality. A replicated field study from California, USA (Pintor & Sih 2011), found that availability of prey, coupled with high levels of stream discharge limited the distribution of signal crayfish Pacifasticus lenuisculus at transect and stream scales, respectively.  A national study from the Czech Republic (Svobodová et al. 2012) found that invasive spiny-cheek crayfish Oronectes limosus were more commonly found in nutrient-enriched water while native species preferred water of a higher quality.  In addition, a replicated study in Japan (Kobayashi et al. 2011) identified that abundant leaf litter content in ponds led to higher densities of red swamp crayfish, due to them using it as a food source. It suggested restricting leaf litter within ponds would reduce crayfish population sizes.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Draining a water body offers a potential control of invasive crayfish by making the location uninhabitable. While some individuals may die as a result of such management, many species are able to tolerate exposure to the air and can walk to adjacent water bodies. A trial in the Czech Republic found that three successive drawdowns of a 0.16 ha pond, followed by hand removal, was not able to remove all signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (Zozak & Policar 2002).  In addition, a review reported that draining habitat can have a significant, short-term impact, reducing populations of red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkia (Stebbing et al. 2012). However, it also reported that this approach causes significant impacts on natural habitats, is expensive, and does not lead to eradication.

1035: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Remove the crayfish by electrofishing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Electric currents are often used for the management of freshwater fishes. Typically the fish are stunned and removed by nets.  Crayfish are also susceptible to electric shocks. A study in the UK of a different species of invasive crayfish, the signal crayfish found that high intensity electric (96 kW, direct current 1600 V, 57.8 A, at 7 Hz) shocks delivered repeatedly via electrode tapes to two sections of stream resulted in crayfish mortality of 86-97% (Peay et al. 2014). All sizes of crayfish were affected, but small individuals (&lt;30 mm carapace length) were more susceptible. Some crayfish survived in the stony banks. In addition, a review proposed that passing an electric current through water, using modified electrofishing gear, could kill the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkia (Stebbing et al. 2012). Employing standard electrofishing methods (with a boat-mounted electrode) stuns crayfish in open water which can then be collected by hand. Those in burrows will survive. A modified version of this equipment was developed for crayfish with a much higher current (96kW instead of 0.5kW of the normal set up, Stebbing et al. 2012). Electrofishing comes with inherent risks to the user and can only be safely conducted during summer months, in shallow, clear water.

1036: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Add chemicals to the water
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Adding chemical toxicants to the water offers the potential for localised control of invasive crayfishes. Chemical ‘dips’ for fishing and sampling gear can also be an effective biosecurity method for preventing the transport of crayfish plague.  Most chemicals will have an impact on non-target organisms, and so their use must be carefully considered before being dosed. In many instances, the use of chemicals may be subject to local or national approval by regulatory authorities. Two before and after studies from Norway (Sandodden & Johnsen 2010) and Scotland (Peay et al. 2006) demonstrated that the biocides cypermethin and pyblast, respectively, were both effective at eradicating a different species of invasive crayfish, signal crayfish. A further study using chlorinated lime was ineffective at controlling signal crayfish in the Czech Republic (Zozak & Policar 2002).

Background information and definitions:
Biocides may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of bullheads, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed.
Rotenone has been successfully used to control populations of bullheads and other fish.  For example, in the UK, studies have reported that rotenone successfully reduced or eradicated populations of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and fathead minnows Pimephales promelas, from ponds and lakes (Britton et al. 2008; Britton et al. 2011).  A risk assessment for piscicidal formulations of rotenone suggests that mortality of bullheads can be achieved with 5-100 parts per billion of rotenone active ingredient, or 100-200 parts per billion of rotenone active ingredient in organic rich ponds, diluted in 38 litres of water, although no scientific evidence was provided (Turner et al. 2007).
It has been suggested that Antimycin is less useful for control of bullheads than rotenone as Antimycin is very toxic to scaled fishes, but is much less toxic to scaleless catfishes (Order Siluriformes), which includes the bullheads (Clearwater et al. 2008).

Background information and definitions:
Encouraging native predators can potentially increase predation on the population of invasive bullheads, thereby biologically controlling bullhead populations.
Large game fish such as bass Micropterus salmoides, pike Esox lucius, pickerel Esox niger, and perch Perca flavescens, in addition to snapping turtles Chelydra serpentina, water snakes, and wading birds are known to prey upon brown bullheads (EPA 2015).  In addition, it is reported that parasitic trematodes, cestodes, copepods and nematodes have been found in brown bullheads, though it is not clear to what extent they affect bullhead survival (EPA 2015).
Protective spines on bullheads and the species' preference for eating mostly at night, make bullheads an uncommon prey for other fish (Sigurdson 2012). However, pike, turtles, flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, great blue herons Ardea herodias and otters (subfamily Lutrinae) eat small bullheads up to four inches long.
It is considered that biological control of adult brown bullheads is unlikely given the paucity of natural predators within the native range, although juveniles may be predated upon by certain large-bodied fishes in the native range, such as Esox species (CABI 2015).

1055: Red-eared terrapin:  Direct removal of adults
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Direct removal of adults by trapping, netting, shooting, or hand capture, may offer a tool for localised eradication, particularly in England, UK where there are no known instances of successful reproduction in the wild.
A variety of traps are referenced in the literature.  For example, a fact sheet on the red-eared terrapin Trachemys scripta references successful use of floating boards with baited cages on top by terrapins as basking sites.  Trap preference is sometimes determined by the level of visibility to the public in addition to efficacy (Bringsøe 2006).   An information bulletin references that in Australia, funnelled ‘Cathedral traps’ are used in preference to ‘basking traps’ which are difficult to transport and unsuitable for use in public or high visibility locations (O’Keefe 2009).  Some studies have researched the impact of bait location on trap success. For example, a replicated field study in the USA researched bait location and found no significant difference in trapping rate between traps with bait suspended near the funnel entrance, and traps with bait filled containers (Nall & Thomas 2009).
No studies have been found that reference successful local eradication using trapping or netting techniques.

1056: Red-eared terrapin:  Biological control using native predators
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A study in the USA provided a strong indication that racoons feed on adult red-eared terrapins Trachemys scripta in their native range, with female terrapins smaller than 200mm in plastron length at particularly high risk (Tucker et al. 1999).
Although hatchlings of red-eared terrapins could conceivably be eaten by a few native UK species including otters (e.g. European otter Lutra lutra), herons (e.g. grey heron Ardea cinerea), rodents or corvids, or even introduced species like the American mink Neovison vison, once adult this species would have few natural enemies in the UK (Bringsøe 2006; Wilkinson 2012).
Successful reproduction of red-eared terrapins has not been recorded in the UK (Scalera 2006).  As native UK predators are unlikely to be large enough to eat adult terrapins it is unlikely that population control using natural predators could deliver a control mechanism for UK populations.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Draining invaded waterbodies may offer a tool for localised management of red-eared terrapin Trachemys scripta populations, provided potentially negative side effects on native species are carefully managed.  Following draining, red eared terrapins may burrow into the silt at the bottom of the waterbody.  For example, a field trial in Queensland, Australia drained a small irrigation dam and found that red-eared terrapins burrowed to a depth of up to 2 m in the silt at the bottom and had to be removed by mechanical excavator (O’Keefe 2009).  The silt was spread in a secure area, raked, and any red-eared terrapins present were removed by hand.  To prevent red-eared terrapins from emigrating during the draining process, the site was first secured with barrier fences and pitfall traps.  No additional details about the methods or results were provided.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Encouraging native predators could potentially increase predation on the population of invasive gobies, thereby biologically controlling goby populations.  For example, a before-and-after field and modelling study, from 1999-2008 in Lake Erie, North America suggested that predator control of round goby Neogobius melanostomus,
by native burbot Lota lota could be effective at controlling population size (Madenjian et al. 2011).  Populations of native burbot were reported to have high potential for predatory control of invasive round gobies and computer modelling indicated that in 2007, burbot consumed approximately 61% of round goby standing stock (Madenjian et al. 2011). Although many species consume round goby, no effective and species-specific biocontrol has yet been reported. More work is therefore required.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Biocides may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of gobies, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed.
Whilst a number of different biocides may be considered for control of goby populations, no evidence has been found relating to detailed scientific study of any of these biocides to control an existing population.  For example, delayed-release and/or pelleted formulations of Bayluscide® are said to have been used in the USA to selectively reduce populations of bottom-associated fish species such as the round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Clearwater et al. 2008).  It is reported that the round goby is unable to detect Bayluscide® and that exposure for a few minutes is lethal to the round goby, even if the fishes are removed to freshwater immediately afterwards (Schreier et al. 2001).  Of the four chemical piscicides registered for use in the USA, rotenone and antimycin A and are considered “general” piscicides, but no studies have been found of their effects on round goby.  Studies have however been conducted on the effects of rotenone on other fish species.  For example, in the UK, before-and-after studies have reported that rotenone successfully reduced or eradicated populations of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and fathead minnows Pimephales promelas from ponds and lakes (Britton et al. 2008; Britton et al. 2011).
The effect of saponins on other fish species has also been studied.  For example, a study in New Zealand found that an increase in water temperature or a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration increases the sensitivity of invasive African flathead goby Glossogobius giurus to saponins provided in the form of teaseed cake (Minsalan & Chiu 1986).  African flathead goby were eliminated by an application of 15 mg/L teased cake (Minsalan & Chiu 1986).   However, no evidence was captured on the impact of saponins on the round goby or the tubenose goby Proterorhinus marmoratus.

Background information and definitions:
Draining invaded waterbodies is a proven tool for reducing the population size of fish such as topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, potentially used in combination with gill netting and electrofishing (Copp et al. 2007), or other habitat modifications such as pH alteration (Britton et al. 2008).  It is therefore possible that it could also prove a useful tool for reducing populations of invasive gobies.
Potentially negative side effects of draining waterbodies on native species need to be carefully managed.  However, it is possible that eradicating invasive gobies from a waterbody would facilitate an increase in the diversity and richness of native species, as found when invasive largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were eradicated through pond drying in a field study in Japan (Tsunoda et al. 2010).

Applying a combination of netting and electrofishing may prove particularly effective in controlling populations of invasive gobies.  Studies have shown this to be effective for other fish species.  For example, two before-and-after studies in Australia and the UK found that electrofishing and gill netting combined were effective at reducing topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva populations (Pinto et al. 2005; Copp et al. 2007).

1069: Ponto-Caspian gobies: Trapping using visual, sound and pheromonal lures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Certain fish species, such as the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, are attracted to pheromones of the same species (Gammon et al. 2005).  This indicates the potential for trapping using sound and pheromonal lures, provided that possible influences on non-target species are addressed.  However, whilst a number of studies have identified sound and pheromonal lures, no evidence has been found for the effectiveness of trapping round gobies or tubenose gobies Pseudorasbora parva using such lures.
Studies have shown the nature of pheromonal attraction in gobies.  For example, two controlled studies demonstrated that reproductive female round gobies were attracted to reproductive male goby pheromones, whilst immature females were attracted to reproducing females but not the male pheromones (Gammon et al. 2005; Corkum et al. 2006). Also, a controlled study on well-fed juvenile round gobies found that they were attracted to the odour of eggs from their own species (Yavno & Corkum 2011).
Other studies have shown the nature of sound attraction.  For example, a replicated, controlled experiment in the laboratory and in the field in the USA found that round gobies showed a highly directed response to playbacks of the calls of the same species (Rollo et al. 2007).  Female round gobies in particular, showed significant attraction to speakers emitting same species male calls.
Other studies have shown the nature of visual attraction.  For example, a controlled study determined that mature female round gobies were attracted to plastic models of male fish, specifically dark (reproductive) rather than mottled (immature) models (Yavno & Corkum 2009).
It may be that a combined approach of visual, sound and pheromonal lures will lead to the highest capture rate.  However, it will be important to identify lures that are specific to invasive gobies.  Some research leads to species-specific lures.  For example, a field study in the USA reported that amino acids and bile acid released by reproductive round gobies consistently resulted in electrical activity in the smell receptors of five other species tested, but only round gobies showed a response to pheromones produced by reproductive male gobies indicating that the pheromones were species-specific in this instance (Ochs et al. 2013).

1070: Ponto-Caspian gobies: Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Addition of dry ice to rapidly deliver a high dose of carbon dioxide, which results in a rapid reduction in dissolved oxygen levels, can sedate some fish species, with minimal residual toxicity.  This may therefore offer a tool enabling selective removal of invasive gobies from waterbodies. This is provided that sufficiently high carbon dioxide levels can be maintained, which may be difficult, particularly in natural water bodies.
Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations by either bubbling the pressurised gas directly into water or by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, has been used to sedate fishes during transport or to allow handling of large numbers of fishes, with minimal residual toxicity (Clearwater et al. 2008). Previous studies have found that exposure to sodium bicarbonate at a concentration of 142–642 mg/litre for five minutes can kill some fish species (Brooke et al. 1978).

1074: Ponto-Caspian gobies: Use of barriers to prevent migration
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
A number of different systems can be used to prevent dispersal of fish to new habitats, or to prevent their migration.  For example, a replicated study from the USA found that leaf litter could act as a barrier, preventing dispersal of the eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki (Alemadi & Jenkins 2008).  Another controlled study from the USA found that sound bubble barriers prevented Asian carp (Cyprinidae) from moving upstream (Ruebush et al. 2012).  Other systems include altered flow rates.  However, one study concluded that water flow rates faster than 125 cm/second, along with a route free from rest and refuge areas, would be necessary to prevent round goby Neogobius melanostomus  migrating upstream (Tierny et al. 2011).  This was because round gobies were found to be able to hold their position in strong water currents for extended periods using their pectoral fins as brakes, and could recover rapidly from exhaustive exercise, achieving powerful speed bursts (Tierny et al. 2011).  Other systems that can be used to prevent fish migration include electrical barriers.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Draining invaded waterbodies is an effective tool for reducing the population size of other fish species such as topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, potentially used in combination with gill netting and electrofishing (Copp et al. 2007), or other habitat modifications such as pH alteration (Britton et al. 2008).  It is therefore possible that it could also prove a useful tool for reducing populations of invasive bullheads.
Potential negative side effects of draining waterbodies on native species need to be carefully managed.  However, it is possible that eradicating invasive bullheads from a waterbody would facilitate an increase in the diversity and richness of native species, as found when invasive largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were eradicated through pond drying in a field study in Japan (Tsunoda et al. 2010).

1082: Brown and black bullheads: Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Addition of carbon dioxide to water in the form of dry ice displaces dissolved oxygen in the water, thereby decreasing its concentration. The increased carbon dioxide concentration has a weakly anaesthetic action on fishes (Clearwater et al. 2008).
Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations by either bubbling the pressurised gas directly into water, or by the addition of sodium bicarbonate has been used to sedate fishes during transport or to allow handling of large numbers of fishes, with minimal residual toxicity (Clearwater et al. 2008). A previous study found that exposure to sodium bicarbonate at a concentration of 142–642 mg/L for 5 min can anaesthetise some fish species (Brooke et al. 1978).
Addition of dry ice may therefore offer a tool enabling selective removal of invasive bullheads from waterbodies. This is provided that sufficiently high carbon dioxide levels can be maintained, which may be difficult, particularly in natural water bodies.  Also, bullhead fish can tolerate relatively low ambient oxygen levels, although it is possible that rapid reduction in oxygen levels may have a sedative effect.

1101: Skunk cabbage:  Physical removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Due to the sensitive ecosystems where skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus occurs, mechanical removal can be a useful method by which to control the population, particularly in the early years of infestation since only older plants of three years or older are capable of producing seeds (EPPO 2009).  It is likely that the whole plant needs to be removed in order to be effective, as partial removal reportedly leads to vegetative reproduction and a high level of regeneration (Fuchs et al. 2003).

1109: Skunk cabbage:  Public education
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Most occurrences of skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus have resulted from human introduction as an ornamental plant.  In addition, where skunk cabbage has been purposefully planted for example along watercourses, and along the margins of ponds and artificial lakes, management activity such as movement of soil and pond cleaning may spread the seeds, and thereby increase the spread of this non-native plant.
Public education programmes can potentially be used to reduce the horticultural trade in skunk cabbage and reduce the spread of mature plants that have been introduced.

1110: Asian clams: Drain the invaded water body
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The relatively thick shells of Asian clams Corbicula spp. will offer protection against desiccation, but prolonged periods of dewatering may serve as an effective management tool in some situations.  Large die-offs of Asian clams have been reported during droughts (Ilarri et al. 2011).  Also, an ecological study conducted between 2005 and 2006 in Lake Constance, which borders Germany, Switzerland and Austria (Werner & Rothhaupt 2008) found that an Asian clam Corbicula fluminea population was adversely affected by unprecedented low water levels and a harsh winter with consequently low water temperatures. Low water levels led to 100% mortality in clams situated at mean low-water level due to desiccation. At lower depths, water temperatures as low as 2oC over a three month period led to a mass die out of the clams. Juvenile clams survived longer than adults. However, at the end of winter, only 1% of the population remained. Although an intervention was not directly tested in this study, the results suggest that low temperatures and drainage may be possible methods of controlling Asian clam populations in the wild.  In regulated rivers, it may also be possible to decrease the flow rate in order to reduce the water level and control Asian clam populations.

1113: Asian clams: Reduce oxygen in the water
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Very low levels of oxygen in the water for a prolonged period may kill Asian clams Corbicula spp. However, even mild reductions in oxygen may offer advantages by increasing the vulnerability of the clams to predation. When attacked, bivalves protect their soft tissues by closing their protective valves. This reduces vulnerability to small predators, but ventilation and oxygen uptake are suspended. In a laboratory study it was found that after a simulated attack, Asian clams under low oxygen conditions reopened their valves sooner than clams under high oxygen conditions, suggesting that low oxygen levels increases vulnerability to predation (Saloom & Duncan 2005).

1116: Asian clams: Change temperature of the water
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
All organisms will have an upper thermal tolerance and so raising water temperatures may offer a tool for management of Asian clams Corbicula spp. Such an approach may be especially suited to industrial facilities that generate an excess of heated water, such as power plants. Reducing water temperatures can also offer a possible management tool. Studies in the St. Clair River, USA reported very large winter die-offs of Corbicula fluminea (French & Schloesser 1996). Populations persisted in the waters immediately downstream of a power plant in which water temperature was relatively high.

1118: Asian clams: Add chemicals to the water
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many chemicals will be effective at killing Asian clams Corbicula spp., but the wider impacts on non-target organisms must also be taken into account. Control agents that do not persist or accumulate in the wider environment are preferable, as are agents that might offer some specificity to bivalve molluscs. Combinations of control agents can offer particular benefits if they enhance one another’s toxicity effect upon the clams.

Key Messages:

A replicated laboratory study in the USA found that dosing with the biocides chlorine, potassium and copper killed Asian clams. 
A controlled, replicated laboratory study and a controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that higher concentrations of chlorine and bromine, delivered at higher temperatures, shortened the time required to kill the Asian clams.

1133: Floating pennywort: Environmental control (e.g. shading, reduced flow, reduction of rooting depth, or dredging)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There are several possible methods of environmental control of floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, none of which give a complete solution.
Shade may be an effective method of control as the plant does not establish well in shaded conditions, and may be achieved by planting trees on the south side of the water body (Newman & Duenas 2010). This is unlikely to be practical to implement on larger water bodies.
Increasing flow will restrict the growth of floating pennywort in situ but may increase the spread of the plant downstream (Newman & Duenas 2010).
Increasing rooting depth to below one metre may reduce the ability of floating pennywort to root at the margins (Newman & Duenas 2010). This, however, will not often be a feasible option. Reducing the amount of suitable rooting substrate by piling or preventing access to suitable areas by netting off sections may prove effective (Newman & Duenas 2010).
All these environmental options are likely to be expensive to implement and are untested (Newman & Duenas 2010).
It is reported that dredging does not seem to be an effective method to eradicate floating pennywort (Haury et al. 2010).  It is also reported that survivorship of floating pennywort may be prevented by a rise in salinity (Ruiz-Avila & Klemm 1996)

1135: Water primrose: Biological control using co-evolved, host specific herbivores
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
One-off introduction of a co-evolved, host-specific herbivore from the area of origin of the invasive pest can potentially provide sustainable control without affecting non-target indigenous plants.
Some studies have reported heavy damage caused to water primrose in the field by herbivorous insects.  For example, the flea beetle Lysathia flavipes has been reported to cause heavy damage in the field to creeping water primrose Ludwigia peploides, although feeding behaviour was reportedly not specific (Cordo & DeLoach 1982a).  It has also been reported that sterile grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella have been used to control large-flower primrose-willow Ludwigia grandiflora (Manuel 1989) although grass carp are non-selective herbivores in which case they could harm native species.
Some studies reference damage caused to water primrose by certain species of insects without referencing their specificity.  For example, a study published in 2000 reports that three beetles, comprising two Lysathia spp. and a Macrohaltica spp., and also the lesser vine Sphinx moth Pholus fasciatus, damage water primrose in Colombia but no reference is made to specificity (Cuevas Medina 2000).
In contrast, other studies appear to have found host-specific agents.  For example, a specificity study in Argentina, found that adults of the weevils Tyloderma spp. A and Tyloderma spp. B appear to have creeping water primrose as their only host plant (Cordo & DeLoach 1982b).

1138: Water primrose: Physical removal
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Manual or mechanical removal of water primrose Ludwigia spp. with manual removal of any visible remaining fragments may offer a tool for localised population eradication.
However, it has been shown that water primrose demonstrates high regeneration capacity, and an ability to regenerate from small shoot fragments with a node with or without leaves (Hussner 2008).  Therefore, it is important to carefully manage any mechanical removal program to prevent regenerative fragments from spreading to new locations.
Manual or mechanical removal programmes have been met with mixed success.  For example, a review reports that effective management of large-flower primrose-willow Ludwigia grandiflora for eradication is relatively difficult, and mechanical removal tends to create viable fragments which can spread to new areas or recolonise existing managed sites (Plant Protection Service et al. 2011).  A study found that mechanical harvesting, followed by several manual finishes over a two year period, eradicated large-flower primrose-willow.  It was noted that ground realities, including inaccessible sites for heavy equipment, and difficulty observing the species, can strongly affect the feasibility (Legrand 2002).  One study reported that in the early stages of water primrose Ludwigia spp. colonisation, removal by hand is usually possible, and that mechanised removal is only necessary when the plant has become well established (Thiébaut 2007).

Background information and definitions:
Application of chemical herbicides may offer a tool for management of water primrose Ludwigia spp. provided regulatory approvals are in place.  For example, glyphosate has been reported to have successfully eradicated water primrose Ludwigia spp. at three UK sites (Renals 2010).
Adjuvants are agents that can modify the effect of chemical herbicides, thereby increasing their effectiveness.  It has been reported that there is a synergistic benefit of applying an adjuvant such as TopFilm alongside glyphosate.  It is reported that the combined use of herbicide and adjuvant has eradicated various small stands of large-flower primrose-willow (Newman 2008). A review also references the potential for synergistic application of glyphosate and TopFilm, reporting the most effective application rates to be 2.28 kg of glyphosate and one litre/ hectare of TopFilm, and reporting June and July to be the best time for application (Plant Protection Service at al. 2011).

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
A combination treatment of herbicide application and physical removal offers a tool for localised population reduction, and can be used to prevent significant deoxygenation of the water body due to decomposition of treated plant material.
Numerous attempts to eradicate water primrose report that a combination treatment is much more effective than chemical treatment alone.  For example, a study in the USA reported that mechanical removal alone had limited effectiveness, whereas a combined glyphosate spray/mechanical removal treatment, though most expensive, gave the most lasting control of water primrose Ludwigia spp. (San Francisco Estuary Institute, et al. 2004).  In support of this, it is reported that large-flower primrose-willow Ludwigia grandiflora was controlled in the Marais Poitevin, France by regular management actions including both mechanical and chemical methods (EPPO 2011).  In addition, it is reported that after a single application of 4.3 kgs glyphosate/ha a population of water primrose Ludwigia spp. almost returned to its initial invasion stage after two years (Dutartre & Oyarzabal 1993; Delbart et al. 2013).

1276: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Biological control using fungal-based herbicides
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The introduction of a co-evolved herbivore from the area of origin of the invasive plant, which eats only the target plant species, could potentially provide sustainable control without affecting other native plants. However, C. helmsii has few reported natural enemies, and a biological control programme should consider consequences for closely-related, protected, native species, such as Crassula aquatica (Sheppard et al. 2006).
Some species of host-specific insects, such as chrysomelid and curculionid beetles, have been used as biological control agents of invasive aquatic weeds in several areas globally with some success (Gassman et al. 2006; see also ‘Water primrose Ludwigia spp. – Biological control using co-evolved, host-specific herbivores’). Mite species which parasitize plants (eriophyid mites) have also been used for biological control of invasive plants (Smith et al. 2010). These mites have high host specificity and negatively affect the host plants’ reproductive success, so could potentially limit the rate of spread of C. helmsii. The stem-mining fly Hydrellia perplexa has also been investigated as a potential biological control agent, although initial results suggest impacts on C. helmsii may be small (Shaw 2013, CABI 2014).
 
Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is another herbivorous species used to control invasive freshwater plant species (see ‘Water primrose Ludwigia spp. – Biological control using co-evolved, host specific herbivores’). However, these fish are non-selective, and C. helmsii appears not to be a preferred food for this species (Dawson & Warman 1987).

1277: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Biological control using herbivores
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The introduction of a co-evolved herbivore from the area of origin of the invasive plant, which eats only the target plant species, could potentially provide sustainable control without affecting other native plants. However, C. helmsii has few reported natural enemies, and a biological control programme should consider consequences for closely-related, protected, native species, such as Crassula aquatica (Sheppard et al. 2006).
Some species of host-specific insects, such as chrysomelid and curculionid beetles, have been used as biological control agents of invasive aquatic weeds in several areas globally with some success (Gassman et al. 2006; see also ‘Water primrose Ludwigia spp. – Biological control using co-evolved, host-specific herbivores’). Mite species which parasitize plants (eriophyid mites) have also been used for biological control of invasive plants (Smith et al. 2010). These mites have high host specificity and negatively affect the host plants’ reproductive success, so could potentially limit the rate of spread of C. helmsii. The stem-mining fly Hydrellia perplexa has also been investigated as a potential biological control agent, although initial results suggest impacts on C. helmsii may be small (Shaw 2013, CABI 2014).
Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is another herbivorous species used to control invasive freshwater plant species (see ‘Water primrose Ludwigia spp. – Biological control using co-evolved, host specific herbivores’). However, these fish are non-selective, and C. helmsii appears not to be a preferred food for this species (Dawson & Warman 1987).

1278: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Physical control using manual/mechanical control or dredging
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mechanical control could be used to remove Crassula helmsii from affected waterways, either by removing vegetation using mechanical or manual methods, or by dredging entire waterbodies. This approach may reduce the dominance of the plant, but is often not fully effective. This is because of the difficulty of removing all the vegetation without small sections breaking off, in combination with C. helmsii’s ability to regenerate from any small fragments that remain (Dawson & Warman 1987). It may require drainage of a pond and removal of the top layer of soil to completely eradicate C. helmsii (Leach & Dawson 2000). The intervention ‘Surround with wire mesh’ discusses using mesh to surround treatment sites and minimize spread of disturbed plant fragments. Dredging and re-profiling waterbodies are included in the intervention ‘Alter environmental conditions to control plants’, and other physical approaches to removal of C. helmsii are discussed in ‘Drying-out waterbodies’ and ‘Burying plants’.

1279: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Chemical control using herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Application of chemical herbicides may offer a tool for localized management of C. helmsii, provided regulatory approvals are in place. Many herbicides apart from glyphosate are no longer approved for aquatic use in Europe. Vegetation above the water may require a different approach to that below the water, meaning that more than one herbicide may be required to eradicate all C. helmsii from a site. The most commonly-used herbicide on emergent vegetation is glyphosate and on submerged vegetation is diquat. Additives (adjuvants) can be used to improve the efficacy of application of chemical treatments. Retreatment after initial application of herbicide is often required.
The intervention ‘Surround with wire mesh’ discusses the use of mesh to surround treatment sites and minimize spread of disturbed plant fragments during herbicide application.
 

Key Messages:

Seven studies (including one replicated and controlled study) in the UK, found that applying glyphosate reduced Crassula helmsii. In one before-and-after study at a single site glyphosate applied in combination with diquat reduced C. helmsii by 98%. Another before-and-after study at a single site found that covering C. helmsii with carpet before treating with glyphosate resulted in an 80% reduction in the plant.
Three out of four studies (including one controlled study) in the UK found that applying diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii. One before-and-after study at a single site found that applying both diquat and glyphosate reduced C. helmsii by 98%. One small, before-and-after trial found no effect of diquat or diquat alginate on cover of C. helmsii. 
One out of two studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in the UK, found that treating submerged C. helmsii with dichlobenil in container trials led to partial reduction in its biomass. One small before-and-after field study found no effect of dichlobenil on C. helmsii.
One replicated, controlled container trial in the UK found that treatment with terbutryne partially reduced biomass of submerged C. helmsii. The same study found reductions in emergent C. helmsii following treatment with asulam, 2,4-D amine and dalapon.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) can kill vegetation by freezing, and has the advantage that no harmful residues are left in the environment. It could therefore be used for targeted treatment of localized patches of C. helmsii. However, a small trial suggested that only parts of the plant that came into direct contact with liquid nitrogen were killed (Leach & Dawson 2000, no data given). Dense mats of C. helmsii are therefore likely to insulate all but the top layer of vegetation from the effects of freezing. Specialist training is also  required for operators applying liquid nitrogen.

Background information and definitions:
Hot foam has been used proposed as an approach for controlling vegetation. A biodegradable, plant-based foam allows heat to remain in contact with plant surfaces for a longer period than using hot water, with the aim of rupturing plant cells and killing the plant.
The use of hot water to control C. helmsii is discussed in ‘Use hot water’.
 

Key Messages:

1293: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use dyes to reduce light levels
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Dye treatments work by reducing the amount of light that penetrates through water, and therefore reducing photosynthesis in plants under the water. This could potentially reduce the growth rate of C. helmsii. However, a study in the Netherlands suggested using soluble red and black dyes did not substantially reduce the amount of light penetrating the water. The authors concluded effective control was unlikely given the extreme adaptability of C. helmsii (EPPO 2014).
For studies covering the use of lightproof barriers to inhibit growth see ‘Use lightproof barriers’. Increasing turbidity or using shading by vegetation to reduce growth are covered under the intervention ‘Alter environmental conditions to control plants’.

Key Messages:

Five before-and-after studies in the UK found that covering Crassula helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced the cover of the plant.

1296: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Alter environmental conditions to control plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
There are several possible methods of changing environmental conditions which could be used to reduce the growth of C. helmsii.
C. helmsii is relatively tolerant of shade, but heavy shade, such as that from overhanging willow trees could potentially reduce its competitive ability.
Increasing turbidity of the water to reduce light penetration and hence restrict plant growth has been suggested as a potential control method for C. helmsii. This could be achieved by releasing bottom-feeding fish, or seeding with nutrients to encourage algal growth (Leach & Dawson 2000).
Physical modification of waterbodies to increase the depth or make the sides steeper, could potentially reduce the area available for colonisation by C. helmsii. There is little evidence that dredging is an effective approach to control C. helmsii, although the total removal of the organic matter layer at the bottom of a pond was reportedly successful in eradicating C. helmsii from one site (Leach & Dawson 2000).

Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Grazing by livestock is often used as a conservation measure to increase plant species diversity in grassland. Depending on the dietary preferences of the animals, grazing could potentially increase or reduce the competitive advantage and coverage of C. helmsii on the margins of waterbodies or marshy areas. Increased grazing pressure was observed to be related to a decrease in C. helmsii cover at waterbodies in the New Forest, but several potentially confounding factors were present (Ewald 2014).

Draining waterbodies is a potential tool for eliminating or reducing invasive aquatic organisms. One pond infested with C. helmsii was reported to have been drained over winter resulting in a reported ‘severely reduced biomass’ of the plant, although no data were provided (Dawson & Warman 1987). The ability of C. helmsii to withstand drying out (Anderson et al. 2015) and regenerate from small fragments of plant material (Dawson & Warman 1987) mean that this approach alone is unlikely to be fully effective. It is also likely to have negative impacts on native species.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mechanical control methods are widely used to control non-native and native weeds. Harvesting and cutting could be used to remove or reduce biomass of parrot’s feather from affected waterbodies. Although the method is relatively cheap compared to other control options it is not species-specific and therefore may impact non-target taxa (Hussner et al. 2017). Due to its capacity to reproduce through vegetative propagation (CABI 2017), the use of this technique may be problematic for the control of parrot’s feather as any fragments that remain may form new stands of vegetation. The use of manual harvesting to control parrot’s feather is discussed in ‘Manual harvesting (hand-weeding)’. The intervention ‘Mechanical excavation’ discusses the mechanical digging to control parrot’s feather and the use of water-jet ventilation and suction dredging are respectively discussed in ‘Removal using water jets’ and ‘Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal’.

Water jets can be used to remove plants from sediments such as sand, peat and clay (Hussner et al. 2017). Plants are unrooted and can then be removed from the water surface. Compared to conventional mechanical harvesting methods, the use of water jets produces a lower number of plant fragments. However, as with other mechanic methods, the use of water jets to wash out plants leads to high water turbidity (Hussner et al. 2017).

1573: Parrot’s feather: Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Suction dredging consists of the use of high pressure water pumps to remove submerged vegetation. This method removes the plants with their root system and therefore reduces their capacity to regrow. The use of scuba divers allows for high species specificity and a combination of suction dredging and hand weeding has successfully eradicated small populations of other invasive aquatic plants (Hussner et al. 2017), including species of the same genus as parrot’s feather (e.g. Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum; Boylen et al. 1996). The control of parrot’s feather using water jet ventilation is presented in ‘Removal using water jets’ and the use of manual and mechanical harvesting to control parrot’s feather are respectively discussed in ‘Manual harvesting (hand-weeding)’ and ‘Mechanical harvesting or cutting’. Control via mechanical excavation is discussed under ‘Mechanical excavation’.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hand-harvesting is a time-consuming yet highly species-specific method for the control of invasive aquatic plants. It has been used for the management of some problematic species (e.g. Ludwigia peploides; Husser et al. 2016); however, since parrot’s feather is capable of reproducing through vegetative propagation this method might be problematic as any fragments that remain may form new stands of vegetation (Husser et al. 2017). Parrot’s feather control using mechanical harvesting is discussed under the intervention ‘Mechanical harvesting or cutting’ and the use of water jet ventilation and suction dredging are respectively discussed in ‘Removal using water jets’ and ‘Suction dredging and diver-assisted suction removal’. ‘Mechanical excavation’ discusses the control of parrot’s feather by means of mechanical digging.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Covering submerged weeds with lightproof barriers, such as plastic foils, tarpaulins or black sheeting, can control growth and eventually kill plants by preventing photosynthesis (De Winton et al. 2013). Lightproof barriers have been used to control other species of the same genus of parrot’s feather with some success (Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum) (Laitala et al. 2012). The method is not species-specific and its usage is usually restricted to small-scale management in slow-flowing or static waterbodies (Hussner et al. 2017).

1585: Parrot’s feather: Water level drawdown
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention, although limited to waterbodies in which water levels can be regulated, has the potential to reduce or eliminate aquatic invasive plants (Hussner et al. 2017). Water level drawdown consists of reducing the water level of a waterbody to expose submerged plants to drying (or freezing) conditions (De Winton et al. 2013). Desiccation may then result in plant mortality. However, parrot’s feather plants can withstand some level of desiccation (Cook 2004) and therefore control using this technique is dependent on the duration of the water level drawdown. The reduction of water levels could also impact non-target native aquatic species.

1599: Parrot’s feather: Biological control using herbivores
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Both host-specific insects and grass carp have been used for the biocontrol of parrot’s feather with some success (Moreira et al. 1999; Hill & Coetzee 2017), however, also native vertebrate herbivores and livestock can consume invasive aquatic plants and consequently can contribute to inhibit their establishment, growth and expansion (Gassman et al. 2006).
The potential of host-specific insects to act as biocontrol agents depends on their ability to cause harm to the target plant, and may also be limited by the climatic conditions required by the insect species (Gassman et al. 2006). Although several insects have been suggested as potential control agents for parrot’s feather (e.g. the stem-boring weevil Listronotus marginicollis has been found to show a feeding and host preference for parrot’s feather, often killing its terminal bud (Oberholzer et al. 2007)), none seem to be in use. Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella consume large amounts of vegetation, and sterile fish have been used for the management and eradication of invasive aquatic plants (Hussner et al. 2017). However, grass carp are generalist herbivores and will consume all palatable plants available to them (Dorenbosch & Bakker 2011, Pine & Anderson 1991). The introduction of non-native control agents, such as herbivorous insects and grass carp, should only be considered following in-depth studies investigating possible undesired consequences to non-target species (Hussner et al. 2017).
Herbivory by both native vertebrates and livestock is often used as a conservation measure in terrestrial habitats. Depending on the dietary preferences of the animals, herbivory can also affect the competitive advantage of aquatic species such as parrot’s feather, and consequently increase biotic resistance of freshwater ecosystems to invasive plants. As an example, herbivory by North American beavers Castor canadensis reduced the abundance of parrot’s feather by 90% (Parker et al. 2007). The impact of terrestrial herbivores may be restricted to the margins of waterbodies or marshy areas, but aquatic and amphibious herbivores such as beavers can affect plant communities further away from water margins.

1602: Parrot’s feather: Decontamination / preventing further spread
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
 Parrot’s feather plants are capable of rapidly regenerating from small fragments, and are highly tolerant of desiccation (Hussner & Champion 2011). As a consequence the species can be easily transported between waterbodies when attached to fishing or watersport equipment, imported with soil or as fragments on machinery. The decontamination of equipment and matter, using for instance hot water or bleach, could therefore potentially limit the spread of the species.

Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Chemical herbicides have been used for the localized control of parrot’s feather (e.g. Morreira et al. 1999). Herbicides licensed for use around the world use a wide diversity of different active ingredients (e.g. 2,4-D, imazapyr, carfentrazone-ethyl, diquat). However, herbicide control of aquatic vegetation is prohibited in numerous countries (e.g. no herbicides are approved for submerged species in Europe) (De Winton et al. 2013; Hussner et al. 2017). Therefore it is important to consider local regulations before using herbicide control. Legislative restrictions may be lifted for herbicides under particular conditions (Hussner et al. 2017). Impacts on non-target species should be considered prior to herbicide use.
Emerged and submerged vegetation may require different herbicides, and adjuvants may increase the efficacy of the treatment. More than one application of the herbicide is often required. The use of fungal-based herbicides to control parrot’s feather is discussed under the intervention ‘Biological control using fungal-based herbicides’.

However, herbicide control of aquatic vegetation is prohibited in numerous countries (e.g. no herbicides are approved for submerged species in Europe) (De Winton et al. 2013; Hussner et al. 2017). Therefore it is important to consider local regulations before using herbicide control. Legislative restrictions may be lifted for herbicides under particular conditions (Hussner et al. 2017). Impacts on non-target species should be considered prior to herbicide use.
Emerged and submerged vegetation may require different herbicides, and adjuvants may increase the efficacy of the treatment. More than one application of the herbicide is often required. The use of fungal-based herbicides to control parrot’s feather is discussed under the intervention ‘Biological control using fungal-based herbicides’.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled laboratory studies in New Zealand and the USA found that endothall reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.
One replicated, randomized, controlled field study in New Zealand found that parrot’s feather plants treated with endohall presented lower cover soon after herbicide application but cover later increased to levels similar to pre-treatment.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled laboratory studies in New Zealand and the USA reported reduced growth of parrot’s feather following treatment with triclopyr.
One replicated, before-and-after and one replicated, controlled field study in New Zealand found that cover was reduced after treatment with triclopyr. However, one of the studies noted that cover later increased to levels close to pre-treatment.
One replicated, controlled laboratory study in New Zealand found that the application of triclopyr led to a greater reduction in cover than the application of glyphosate.

One replicated, controlled laboratory study in New Zealand found that the application of dichlobenil reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.
Two replicated, randomized, controlled field studies in Portugal and New Zealand found that the application of dichlobenil reduced cover less than the combined application of the herbicides 2,4-D and MCPA eight days after treatment but not 45 days after treatment and that plants treated with dichlobenil presented lower vegetation cover soon after herbicide application but cover later increased to levels close to pre-treatment.
Three laboratory studies (including two replicated, controlled studies and one randomized, controlled study) in the USA found that the herbicides imazamox and imazapyr reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.
One replicated, randomized, controlled field study in Portugal and one replicated, controlled, laboratory study in the USA reported reduced parrot’s feather biomass after treatment with glyphosate. One replicated, randomized, controlled field study in Portugal found that the application of gluphosinate-ammonium reduced the biomass of parrot’s feather.
Three replicated, controlled laboratory studies in New Zealand and the USA found that treatment with fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth of parrot’s feather.
One replicated, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that the application of flumioxazin reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.
One replicated, randomized, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that the application of florpyrauxifen-benzyl reduced the growth of parrot’s feather.

1709: Parrot’s feather: Multiple integrated measures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Due to the complexity of controlling parrot’s feather, multiple integrated measures may be needed for the complete removal of the species from one site. These could include a combination of mechanical and physical control techniques, biological control techniques and/or chemical control techniques. For example, suction dredging and hand-weeding could be used in combination for the removal of submerged invasive aquatic plants, or herbicide could be applied prior to grass carp stocking for faster control and a reduction of management costs (De Winton et al. 2013).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of multiple integrated measures to control parrot’s feather.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
