1422: Remove and relocate ‘problem’ animals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
So-called ‘problem’ animals are animals that cause damage to humans or their property. Problem causing animals can be captured alive in the area of conflict, and transported and released in another suitable area. Animals are either returned to their normal home range, in the hope that the negative experience will prevent them from returning to the area of conflict, or are transported further, to an area with reduced conflict potential, where it is hoped that they will stay (Linnell et al. 1997).

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in India found that ‘problem’ rhesus monkeys that were translocated, alongside other interventions, survived and remained at the release sites for at least four years.
One controlled, before-and-after study in Kenya found that after 16 years, most crop-raiding olive baboons that were translocated from farmland, alongside other interventions, had survived and had similar survival rates compared to non-translocated populations.
One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Republic of Congo and Gaboon found that 84% of the ‘problem’ western lowland gorillas that were relocated, alongside other interventions, survived for at least four years.

1423: Relocate primates to non-residential areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Primates may cause hazards to humans and their property in residential areas. For example, they may enter private homes, steal food, and cause damage to properties. Primates that live in/near residential areas may also injure people and represent a health hazard, as they can transmit various diseases to humans and vice versa. In an effort to protect both primates and humans, primates may be relocated to areas that are less densely populated by humans, or natural areas. This intervention may be implemented before the building of the residential area or at a later stage in response to primates invading an existing residential area.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of relocating primates to non-residential areas on primate populations.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fences (also called ‘fence rows’) may be used by primates as travel pathways in agricultural-forest mosaics to move from one forest patch to the next. These may be ‘living fences’, which are wide fences that have natural vegetation (trees, bushes) growing around/between them, or they can be ordinary wire or wooden fences. A study found that red howler monkeys Alouatta seniculus, squirrel monkeys Saimiri spp., tufted capuchin monkeys Sapajus apella and dusky titis Callicebus moloch in gallery forest fragments in the Eastern Colombian Llanos used living fences and wire fences as corridors to travel between forest patches (Carretero Pinzón et al. 2008). However, this study reported on personal observations and did not evaluate this intervention using a robust study design and statistics and so has not been summarised as evidence below.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many primate species display extraordinary behavioural flexibility, which allows them to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions and persist in moderately disturbed environments. For example, in Sierra Leone, small-scale subsistence farming allows areas of fallow land and secondary forest to remain where chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus can find food and shelter (Brncic et al. 2010). Therefore, retaining sufficient amounts of nesting trees and/or shelter for primates within agricultural lands may promote primate conservation in these areas.

This intervention aims to certify sustainably farmed products as ‘primate friendly’, and sell them at a premium. Several environmentally and/or socially responsible product certifications already exist, such as ‘FAIRTRADE’, Organic or ‘Rainforest Alliance’ certifications. A gorilla-specific certification, ‘Gorilla Fund Cofee’, was launched aiming to support Rwandan coffee farmers as they develop sustainable alternatives to logging and poaching, two of the largest threats facing mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei, while also raising funds to support gorilla conservation programs in Rwanda (Ellison, 2004). Recently, another certification product, ‘Grauer’s Gorilla Fund Coffee’, was launched using coffee from 3,600 co-operative Congolese farmers and aiming to support Grauer’s gorilla Gorilla beringei graueri conservation in the Congo. Both products are also Fairtrade certified. If succesfull, such schemes could be used as models for other product certifications, such as ‘lemur-friendly’ vanilla production in Madagascar or San Martin titi monkey  Callicebus oenanthe and cocoa production in Peru.

1436: Install mechanical barriers to deter primates (e.g. fences, ditches)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fencing is the most often used mechanical barrier to keep animals out of agricultural lands. However, fence design and materials can be very expensive and must constantly be maintained. In addition, primates quickly learn how to by-pass electric fences. Furthermore, the area on either side of the fence has to be kept clear of tall vegetation to prevent the animals using overhanging branches to move across the fence. This suggests that such fencing might be more effective for restraining larger, less agile animals such as great apes, than for baboons Papio spp. and guenons Cercopithecus spp. that are able to jump considerable distances. Walls and ditches, on the other hand are considered largely ineffective because of most primate species’ agility and climbing skills (Strum 1994). Canals could be useful barriers, but they have to be deep and wide enough to deter primates from crossing. However, deep, wide canals can create a drowning risk for primates and for humans, as well as pose disease risks if water becomes stagnant, and could become ineffective if problems develop with maintaining water levels. Canals and their banks must be kept devoid of items that primates might use as tools to get across (Hockings & Humle 2009).

Crops that are unpalatable to primates can be planted as buffer crops to prevent crop raiding incidents in adjacent areas with more palatable crops. Buffer crops usually constitute plants that are high in fibre and secondary compounds such as tea, timber, or sisal (Chiyo et al. 2005, Hockings & Humle 2009), or chilli. However, if not managed well, the buffer crop may attract primates. The use of buffer zones in which habitat was destroyed to make them unusable for primate species and therefore deter primates from these areas is discussed under ‘Destroy habitat inside buffer zones to make them unusable for primate species’.

This intervention entails changing crops favoured by crop-raiding primates to those less palatable or accessible to raiders. However, switching to less susceptible subsistence crops may lead to reduced dietary diversity and food insecurity possibly affecting human communities living in/near the primate habitat (e.g. Akankwasah 2008). Additionally, changes in the range and type of food crops may reduce fertility if crops are not rotated (Mc Guinness & Taylor 2014).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using telemetry tracking devices on primates to record the location of their movements can help to warn farmers when primates approach their fields. In addition, such data may become valuable in understanding spatial movement patterns and drivers of crop-raiding behaviour. Although GPS (Global Positioning System) devices have improved greatly over the past 10 years, the dense canopy cover characteristic of the habitat of many primate species can make it difficult to obtain accurate GPS readings. In addition, deploying telemetry devices to the primate usually involves tranquilizing the individual, which poses various health risks to, and may even result in the death of the primate. Primatologists generally oppose attaching telemetry devices to great apes, as these may alter their behaviour and because it is not ethical to use them on great apes (Lonsdorf et al. 2010).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers could use loud-speakers to play sounds that are perceived as threats by the problem primates to deter them from farms. These can be sounds of barking dogs, explosions, gunshots, vocalizations of predators, etc. However, one problem with this intervention is that primates could habituate to the ‘false alarms’ ultimately leading to a reduction in the long-term effectiveness of this method. This has been found to be the case with baboons Papio anubis (Strum 1994). A study that tested the influence of a combination of human and mechanical sounds, predator sounds, and vocalizations of other primates living in the same area, on primate activity budgets, found that play-backs of these sounds caused Cape baboons Papio ursinus to run more and feed less, but that there was no effect on the behaviour of vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus (Richardson, 2014).

            Using loud-speakers to broadcast sounds of potential threats to crop-raiding primates is discussed under ‘Use loud-speakers to broadcast sounds of potential threats (e.g. barking dogs, bird-fright explosions, gunshots)’.

1448: Strategically lay out the scent of a primate predator (e.g. leopard, lion)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Predator scent, which is collected from animals in game farms, zoos and preserves and sold commercially, can be used to strategically lay out predator scent around agricultural fields in an attempt to deter primates from crop raiding. There is some evidence that these techniques can be effective against the more timid animals, but bolder crop raiders appear not to be put off (Sillero-Zubiri & Switzer 2001).

1451: Minimize ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Open cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow pit. Walls of the pit are generally blast mined, creating ground vibrations and resulting in dust generation and water, air, and noise pollution. Although we are not aware of any studies evaluating the effect of open cast mining on primates specifically, one study found that species richness was higher at the site that was more distant from the mine and that species composition and characteristics of animal calls differed between the two sites, suggesting that blasting may influence vocal communication in animals and negatively affect wildlife populations (Duarte et al. 2015). Minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining can help to reduce pollution and lessen stress levels in resident primate populations.

Background information and definitions:
Watersheds in mining zones affected by active and/or abandoned hard rock mining may act as sources of metals contamination and acid mine drainage. This is because in order to cluster the mineral extractions, chemicals such as cyanide and mercury are used and are often discharged, intentionally or not, into nearby rivers and streams (A.P.E.S. undated). Establishing no mining zones in/near watersheds may help to prevent water pollution and thus help maintain primate populations.

1455: Create/preserve primate habitat on islands before dam construction  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Almost 20% of the world’s electricity is being provided by dams along rivers (Harrison-Levine et al. 2016), which can pose a severe threat to local primate population persistence (Estrada et al. 2017). In 2004, the WWF reported that 1,600 new large dams were under construction and that a high proportion of these are in primate range countries. There are also plans for 151 new dams in the Amazon basin, of which more than 80% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission lines, or inundation. At least 17 of the world’s remaining 64 large free-flowing rivers are in danger of being dammed by 2020, including several within primate habitat countries in South America and Southeast Asia (Harrison-Levine et al. 2016). To reduce/avoid the drowning of primates during flooding, this intervention makes sure that there are islands covered in primate habitat that the animals can flee to in order to survive. However, there are several problems with this approach. For example, primates that flee to such islands may encounter overcrowded habitats and increased competition with conspecifics. These individuals are unfamiliar with the new habitat, resulting in difficulties to find food, water, shelter, and mates, and they may be at a higher risk of disease and predation (Harrison-Levine et al. 2016).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Green bridges are bridges that have natural vegetation growing on them and that are usually not accessible to humans. These bridges try to combat habitat fragmentation by allowing animals to safely cross human-made barriers (e.g. roads or rail tracks), thus re-connecting previously continuous habitats. In addition, they also help reduce collisions between vehicles and wildlife. Green bridges could be used by terrestrial or semi-terrestrial primates, such as chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, baboons Papio spp. and sooty mangabeys Cercocebus atys.

Furthermore, primates may be able to cross roads more easily in areas where speed limits are enforced compared to areas with no traffic regulations. However, a study investigating the barrier effect of roads on the bank vole Myodes glareolus, yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and common shrew Sorex araneus found that traffic intensity did not affect crossing rates in any of these species (Rico et al. 2007).

The aim of this intervention is to ensure that mining operators keep the number of newly built primary and secondary roads at a minimum in order to limit negative road effects on biodiversity. This will involve careful planning prior to implementation. For this to be achieved, it is important that infrastructure engineers and natural resource managers work together to consider distributions of endangered plants and animals and their key spatial resources, habitat use during events such as wildlife migrations, as well as the economic viability when planning a new road network in an environmentally sensitive area (Caro et al. 2014).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many national parks and other protected areas are intersected by roads, especially in the developed world, and more recently, in tropical nations. For example, in Indonesia, the government is planning large, paved roads through Gunung Leuser Ecosystem and Kerinci Seblat, the two most important national parks for Sumatran tiger conservation (Bass et al. 2010). Apart from heavy vehicle traffic and the threats associated with that, vehicles that transport goods from around protected areas (e.g. charcoal and other natural resources collected outside and inside the protected area) to cities pose an exceptional threat to primates and their habitats. First, they increase the probability of successful alien plant invasions into pristine areas (Caro et al. 2014). Secondly, heavy vehicles like trucks have different stopping characteristics from passenger cars and so collisions between trucks and wildlife may be particularly severe. For example, trucks may require 50% more distance to stop than passenger cars (Zimmermann 2009). This intervention involves re-routing trucks around protected areas and/or high primate density areas to prevent the spread of invasive species into natural primate habitat and to reduce primate-vehicle collisions.

1469: Encourage use of traditional hunting methods rather than using guns 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is based on the assumption that when indigenous people hunt with modern weapons (e.g. shotguns), their harvest is larger than when they hunt with traditional hunting gear (e.g. bow and arrow, blow-gun, spear). This has been shown for example for indigenous forest dwelling people in the Amazon (Alvard 1995) and in tropical rainforests of south-eastern Peru (Mena et al. 1999). Similarily, a ban on firearms after 1974 on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, meant that by 1986 primates appeared to have increased in abundance and were recolonising some areas despite ongoing hunting for bushmeat using traps (Butynski & Koster, 1994). Based on this assumption the argument is that encouraging indigenous people to use traditional hunting methods rather than modern firearms will ultimately lead to a reduction in off-take rates and therefore more sustainable hunting practices.

To control the illegal trade in primates, road blocks can be installed on main transport routes used by traders to bring bushmeat and live animals from their natural habitats to urban areas for sale or to hubs of international transport. Law enforcement officers posted at these roadblocks typically inspect cars that pass through, confiscate bushmeat of species that are legally protected and punish these traders (e.g. officially warn them, fine them, arrest them). One correlative study (Stokes et al. 2010) showed that Forestry Management Units (selective logging occurs), in which installing road blocks formed part of several conservation management strategies implemented at these sites, had higher densities for both gorillas and chimpanzees, when compared to a logging concession where no conservation management activities were in place.

Some teams may also capture and arrest illegal hunters on site, seize bushmeat, and destroy hunting camps. Correlative studies have shown that in areas where anti-poaching patrols were conducted, primate densities were higher (Stokes et al. 2010) and at sites where law enforcement guards were present, the probability that gorilla Gorilla spp. and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes populations would persist in the long-term, was higher (Tranquilli et al. 2012). However, while anti-poaching patrols reduced illegal hunting in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, including of primate species, they were inadequate to cope with higher levels of poaching pressure during armed conflict (De Merode et al. 2007). Removing of snares by teams that may form part of anti-poaching patrols is discussed separately under ‘Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares’, and the training of-, and the providing of equipment to anti-poaching patrols is discussed under ‘Provide training to anti-poaching ranger patrols’, and ‘Provide better equipment (e.g. guns) to anti-poaching ranger patrols’. The use of monitoring surveillance strategies and/or monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols is discussed under ‘Implement monitoring surveillance strategies (e.g. SMART) or use monitoring data to improve effectiveness of wildlife law enforcement patrols’.

1475: Regularly de-activate/remove ground snares 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some primate species, especially larger and more terrestrial species, such as gorillas Gorilla spp. and chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, may be injured by getting caught in snares typically set out to catch animals such as duikers Cephalophus spp. and bush pigs Potamochoerus larvatus. These primate species can get their hands or feet trapped in snares while travelling through the forest, often resulting in life threatening injuries and even death. This intervention involves the regular patrolling of teams to de-activate/remove ground snares.
            The patrolling of areas by anti-poaching teams to reduce hunting is discussed separately under ‘Conduct regular anti-poaching patrols’, and the providing of training and equipment to anti-poaching patrols is discussed under ‘Provide training to anti-poaching ranger patrols’, and ‘Provide better equipment (e.g. guns) to anti-poaching ranger patrols’, respectively.

Background information and definitions:
We know that in many areas of the world, people, communities and religions have taboos against the killing and/or eating of certain primate species (e.g. Brncic et al. 2010, Costa 2010, Jimoh et al. 2012, Xiang et al. 2013). However, it has also been suggested that the presence of other tribes, new religions/westernization, use of modern hunting equipment and poverty pose a threat to the effectiveness of taboos as a conservation tool (Jimoh et al. 2012). The strengthening, supporting or re-installing of traditions/taboos that forbid the killing of primates may therefore lead to a reduction in hunting rates.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention entails using surveillance strategies, such as SMART (http://smartconservationtools.org/), or monitoring data, such as spatial data on hunting intensity and/or primate density, to improve the efficiency of law enforcement patrols. For example, an analysis by N’Goran et al. (2012) of monitoring and patrol data from Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, found that patrol teams spent more time in areas of high human activity and poaching, implying that the monitoring data helped to guide law enforcement patrols to areas where hunting was concentrated, thereby increasing their efficiency. However, the study did not relate patrol effort to primate densities and therefore conclusions could not be drawn about the effectiveness of patrols.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to replace primate bushmeat with other domestic- or wild animal protein sources, such as e.g. fish, snails, chickens, pigs, or goats, which are bred and raised at small-scale animal farms. Some very abundant wild mammal species (e.g. agricultural pests) may also be used as a food source and potentially serve as substitutes for primate bushmeat. An example of such a species is the greater cane rat Thryonomys swinderianus, which is raised in cages and sold for meat in many African countries. A correlative study by Junker et al. (2015) found that in areas where fish protein was relatively affordable to people, chimpanzee density was higher than in other areas, suggesting that people may replace bushmeat with fish protein when they can afford it.

It is believed that one way to control the hunting of primates is to offer employment to hunters in the conservation sector, for instance as anti-poaching rangers, monitoring and data collection officers, or eco-tourist guides. Employment provides the hunter with a regular income source and the hunter will gain knowledge on the importance of conserving primates and potentially pass this knowledge on to other hunters/members in the community. Furthermore, employing hunters as conservation practitioners makes use of the excellent tracking skills and large knowledge base.

1485: Use selective logging instead of clear-cutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Logging is the third greatest threat to primates in all regions worldwide (Estrada et al. 2017). Selective logging is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clear-cutting, which entails removing all trees at the same time. The idea behind selective logging is to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well. Selectively logged areas can sustain primates at varying densities, depending on the logging intensity and history (e.g. Bortolamiol et al. 2014). Although several correlative studies have shown that high logging intensity spatially correlates with low primate density (e.g. Weisenseel et al. 1993) and local extinction in very heavily-logged or clear-cut areas (e.g. Ancrenaz et al. 2010), in some moderately-logged areas, densities of some primate species, including eastern chimpanzees Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and western gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla for example, were reported to be relatively high (e.g. Bortolamiol et al. 2014, Stokes et al. 2010). For orangutans Pongo pygmaeus morio, a simulation study by Wilson et al. (2014) has suggested that reduced-impact logging practices, coupled with additional protection may be a strategy that could even outperform habitat protection.

1486: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clear-cutting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Patch-retention harvesting, also called ‘clear-cutting with reserves’, entails retaining a certain percentage (typically 10%) of a harvested unit within discrete patches of mature and/or immature trees. It is hoped that primates will resettle and survive in these patches in the long-term. Clear-cut logging (i.e. the removal of all trees at the same time) is practiced on the remaining e.g. 90% of the harvesting unit. The spatial properties of the patches (i.e. size, shape and distance between patches) need to be considered as they are likely to play an important role for their effectiveness in ensuring the long-term survival of the displaced primate populations (Diamond 1975). This logging strategy has been applied mostly in the sub-boreal Spruce Bioclimatic zone.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is particularly important for territorial primate species that live in social groups with spatially well-defined home ranges. If logging were conducted at multiple sites within an area similar to the size of the primate species core range and over a short span of time, then an entire social group could be displaced. It has therefore been recommended that relatively small logging compartments that will be exploited simultaneously should lie at a distance of each other that equals at least the distance between different groups/communities (Morgan & Sanz 2007).

1490: Clear open patches in the forest
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Selective logging can substantially change the forest structure. For example, Thiollay (1997) showed that regenerating stands in northern French Guiana (northeastern Amazonia) had dense undergrowth and an open canopy, which was the inverse of that of the primary forest, which typically has an open understorey and a closed canopy. This change in forest structure as a result of selective logging may negatively affect primates, both arboreal and terrestrial in acquiring resources, shelter and their ability to move through the forest. This intervention aims at reducing part of the impact described above (at least for the more terrestrial primate species) by clearing open patches in the forest to get rid of the dense undergrowth.
            The removal of trees to reduce density is discussed under ‘Thin trees within forests’. The clearing of secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation is discussed under ‘Manually control or remove secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation’.

1491: Thin trees within forests
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Thinning of trees entails the removal of trees to reduce density. This intervention, which is usually undertaken in commercial forestry to ensure that stands are made up of healthy even-spaced trees, aims to restore more natural open forest by increasing structural diversity in young even-aged stands and promoting the development of larger trees, multi-level canopies, and understorey vegetation. Although originally used in the context of commercial forestry, this intervention is believed to also promote primate conservation in selectively-logged forest.
            The clearing of open patches in the forest to reduce undergrowth density is discussed under ‘Clear open patches in the forest’. The clearing of secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation is discussed under ‘Manually control or remove secondary mid-storey and ground-level vegetation’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of thinning trees within forests on primate populations.

1493: Avoid slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Climbers, lianas, hemi-epiphytic figs Ficus spp.  and ground vegetation represent important food sources to many primate species. As lianas physically link trees together, they also provide canopy-to-canopy access for many arboreal primates. This intervention aims to prevent cutting or damaging of these plants during selective logging activities in the hope that this will also promote primate conservation. 
            The avoidance of important primate food tree species during selective logging operations is discussed under ‘Avoid/minimize logging of important food tree species for primates’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of avoiding slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation on primate populations.

Background information and definitions:
Uncontrolled roads threaten primate populations through providing access for poaching and forest encroachment (e.g. Laurance et al. 2009), and because they promote habitat loss, fragmentation, and wildfires. Therefore, to promote primate conservation in logging concessions, it is critical that logging companies close non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete.

Background information and definitions:
The idea behind this intervention is to take into account physical barriers in the environment that may restrict primate movement, such as rivers, dense vegetation, mountains, steep valleys, roads or other human-made barriers, etc. when planning logging activities. In this context it is important that the logging company works inwards from such barriers to avoid pushing primates toward these, thereby allowing them to relocate to more suitable habitat.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of working inward from barriers or boundaries to avoid pushing primates toward an impassable barrier or inhospitable habitat on primate populations.

1499: Reduce the size of forestry teams to include employees only (not family members)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention is based on the observation that high human densities correlate with higher primate threat intensity prevalent in these areas. In other words, primate species facing the most threat are those that occur in regions of higher than average human density (Harcourt & Parks 2003). To promote primate conservation in logging concessions, it is therefore advisable to restrict the number of people in forestry teams (only employees, not family members) and to control the influx of people into logging concessions.
            The provisioning of employees with meat protein is discussed under ‘Provide domestic meat to workers of the logging company to reduce hunting’.

1500: Certify forest concessions and market their products as ‘primate friendly’
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
More than fifty certification standards already exist worldwide aiming to ensure the sustainable logging of forests (e.g. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)). Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed as defined by a particular standard, and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale. None of these certifications, however, directly relate to primates or their habitats. This intervention involves the certification of wood logged by companies that adhere to strict impact minimization/mitigation/compensation schemes to promote the conservation of key primate populations and their habitat. Certified products could then be marketed as ‘primate friendly’ and sold at a premium.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of certifying forest concessions and marketing their products as ‘primate friendly’ on primate populations.

1501: Provide domestic meat to workers of the logging company to reduce hunting
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Several studies have shown that bushmeat consumption is not solely taste-driven (e.g. Jenkins et al. 2011), but that other factors, such as price (Schenck et al. 2006) and availability (e.g. Fa et al. 2003) may play an important role in human meat choice. Because of this, it is believed that providing workers employed by the logging company with alternative domestic meat sources will reduce illegal hunting for bushmeat.
            Reducing the size of forestry teams in an effort to reduce human density-dependent threat levels to primates and their habitat, particularly poaching, is discussed under ‘Reduce the size of forestry teams to include employees only (not family members)’.

1502: Implement a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The deliberate and long-term provision of food to wildlife by people, e.g. tourists, or for attracting tourists, can have a variety of negative impacts. For example, it can alter natural behavioural patterns and wildlife population levels, has resulted in the dependency of animals on the human provided food and their habituation to human contact, has increased intra and inter-species aggression, and has various health implications arising from artificial food sources causing injury and disease (Orams 2002). This intervention involves enforcing a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy to prohibit the provision of food to primates.
The use of signage to warn people not to feed primates is discussed under ‘Put up signs to warn people about not feeding primates’. The use of garbage bins inaccessible to primates is discussed under ‘Install ‘primate-proof’ garbage bins’. Prohibiting people from consuming food in natural primate habitat is discussed under ‘Do not allow people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them’.

1505: Install ‘primate-proof’ garbage bins
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Because primates have opposable digits, they can easily open garbage bins that are inaccessible to other wildlife species and therefore, garbage bins at tourist sites or other areas that are frequented by both humans and other primates are frequently raided by the latter. The consumption of human food wastes by primates can result in their dependency on the human provided food, their habituation to human contact, increased intra and inter-species aggression, and various health implications arising from artificial food sources causing injury and disease (Orams 2002). This intervention aims to reduce the raiding of garbage bins by primates by designing garbage bins in such a way that their content becomes inaccessible to them (e.g. mounting bins to the ground, adding lids and locks to prevent primates from opening the lids).
            The use of signage to inform people about not being allowed to feed primates is discussed under ‘Put up signs to warn people about not feeding primates’. The implementation and enforcement of ‘no-feeding’ policies is discussed under ‘Implement a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy’. Prohibiting people from consuming food in natural primate habitat is discussed under ‘Do not allow people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them’.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
In areas where primates and humans come into close contact with one another, such as at tourist sites, some primate species may develop extremely effective strategies to access the food that is eaten by humans at these sites. However, the consumption of human food wastes by primates can result in their dependency on the human provided food, their habituation to human contact, increased intra and inter-species aggression, and various health implications arising from artificial food sources causing injury and disease (Orams 2002). This intervention aims to reduce the negative impact of consumption of human foods by primates, by disallowing people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them.

1513: Coppice trees
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Coppicing takes advantage of the fact that many trees make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down. It is a pruning technique where a tree or shrub is cut to near ground level, or higher, before bud break to encourage vigorous young shoots. In subsequent growth years, many new shoots will emerge, and, after a number of years the coppiced tree is ready to be harvested and the cycle begins again. This intervention could help to reduce the loss of mature trees, thereby reducing the negative impact of wood harvesting on the intactness of primate habitat.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of coppicing trees on primate populations.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The resettlement of people from existing or newly-established protected areas to increase protection of the habitat and the species living in it, is inherently political and hotly debated (Adams & Hutton 2007). The intervention is based on the notion that settlements and the actions of the people living in these settlements threaten the integrity of the natural area that is under protection. Therefore, the intervention involves moving the people from inside the protected area to the outside. Examples of resettled communities include the people from the Nechasar National Park in southern Ethiopia, before handing the area over to the African Parks Foundation, displacements in Korup National Park, Cameroon, through a progressive resettlement scheme of the Ekundukundu Village, or the eviction of Bushmen from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (Adams & Hutton 2007).

1516: Use prescribed burning within the context of home range size and use 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Controlled burning alters forest structure and opens up the tree canopy, which can affect primates in different ways, depending on their habitat and ecology, as well as fire intensity, frequency and size of the burnt area. While some species, like the Siamang Symphalangus syndactylus, avoid fires, others, like some baboon- Papio spp., Guenon- Cercopithecus spp. and Macaque species Macaca spp., as well as western chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus, forage in burns and consume cooked fruits and seeds (Herzog et al. 2014). Furthermore, fire-induced primate range expansions have been observed and documented for yellow baboons Papio cynocephalus and vervet monkeys Chlorocebus aethiops. Prescribed burning may result in immediate foraging improvements post-fire, as well as delayed foraging opportunities in burned habitats. Therefore, controlled burning could potentially be used to promote primate conservation through improving foraging opportunities.

1532: Control habitat-altering mammals (e.g. elephants) through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves excluding mammals that alter the habitat in such a way that it may negatively affect primate populations. For example, elephants may destroy large numbers of trees when they occur at very high densities (e.g. Laws 1970). If, for example, the destruction of trees by elephants resulted in food shortages for resident primate population, then this intervention may indirectly benefit primates that depend on these plants for food through allowing the habitat to recover, once the elephants are removed.  This is an invasive intervention and its usefulness should be carefully considered from an ethical perspective before implementing it.

1533: Remove alien invasive vegetation where the latter has a clear negative effect on the primate species in question
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The negative impact of alien invasive vegetation on resident native species, communities or ecosystems has been demonstrated by a wide range of studies (Vilà et al. 2011). This intervention involves the removal of alien invasive vegetation and could be implemented in the cases where such vegetation has a negative effect on the primate species in question. For example, alien invasive vegetation may replace native plant species that present important food sources to primates or that were used for shelter by the primate species in question. Furthermore, alien invasive vegetation may also alter fire regimes thereby representing a direct (death or injury) and indirect (habitat destruction) threat to resident primate populations (Brooks et al. 2004).

1536: Prevent gene contamination by alien primate species introduced by humans, through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to prevent the breeding/mixing of genes (hybridizing) of alien (non-native) and native primate species through exclusion by e.g. primate-proof fences or by translocation of the alien species. There are not many cases in the world where alien and native primate species co-occur and breed with one another. One example is the threatened golden-headed lion tamarin Leonthopithecus chrysomelas that was introduced in Niterói city forests (Rocha et al. 2011). L. chrysomelas hybridizes with the native species L. rosalia thereby weakening the latter’s gene pool (Rocha et al. 2011). Rocha and Bergallo (2012) recommend that for populations of threatened species in areas outside their original distribution, a programme is needed that includes identification of areas within the natural range where the species is extinct, removal of the causes of extinction in those areas, then gradual removal of the species from its introduced range and release in the relocation areas following the IUCN guidelines for reintroduction of species.’

Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to prevent the spread of viral and bacterial diseases from humans to primates and can be implemented in situations where humans regularly come into close contact with primates, such as when researchers or tourists observe habituated primates in their natural habitat. Another argument for limiting human-primate interactions is that regular contact with humans may influence the behaviour of primates. For example, Riedler et al. (2010) could show that Sumatran orangutans Pongo abelii that were allowed to spend only a limited amount of time with the caretakers, acted more like wild orangutans after release than individuals that had regular and close contact to them.

Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves detecting and treating sick or injured primates to increase their chance of survival. This intervention frequently forms part of-, but is not necessarily restricted to reintroduction or translocation programmes. To implement this intervention, primates may be temporarily captured, treated and re-released, or they may be treated using remote drug delivery methods.

1552: Control 'reservoir' species to reduce parasite burdens/pathogen sources
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The transmission of infectious agents from reservoir animal populations (e.g. domesticated species) to sympatric (occurring within the same geographical area) wildlife presents a particular threat to endangered species, because the presence of infected reservoir hosts can lower the pathogen's threshold density and lead to local wildlife population-level extinctions. For example, African wild dogs Lycaon pictus became extinct in the Serengeti in 1991, concurrent with epizootic canine distemper in sympatric domestic dogs (e.g. Daszak et al. 2000). This intervention aims to control such reservoir species to reduce parasite burdens/pathogen sources for wild primate populations.
            Controlling the actions of humans as ‘reservoir’ species to reduce pathogen sources is discussed under: ‘Ensure that researchers are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy’, ‘Regularly disinfect researcher's clothes, boots etc.’, ‘Wear gloves when handling primate food, tool items, etc.’, ‘Implement quarantine for people arriving at, and leaving the site’, ‘Wear face-masks to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates’, ‘Keep safety distance to habituated animals’, and ‘Limit time that researchers are allowed to spend with habituated animals’.

1553: Conduct veterinary screens of animals before reintroducing/translocating them
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention aims to detect potentially dangerous diseases in primates that are being introduced/translocated to prevent disease transmission to resident, wild primates. The IUCN guidelines suggest that disease screening should test primates for infectious agents that are not found naturally in wild populations of the species/taxonomic group of concern (such as pathogens acquired from people or other animals) and agents that may result in the introduction or spread of potentially dangerous diseases. The infectious agents that are ultimately tested for depend on the geographical region, taxon of concern, available technologies, funding, and other such factors (Soorae & Baker 2002).

1561: Remove human food waste that may potentially serve as food sources for primates to avoid disease transmission and conflict with humans  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Food provisioning to primates in the form of human food waste is a common problem in tourist areas/near tourist lodges and in other areas where primates and humans co-occur (e.g. urban areas). It can lead to an increased risk of human-primate disease transmission (Beisner et al. 2016), changes in individual activity and ranging patterns (e.g. Altmann & Muruthi 1988, Sengupta et al. 2015), an increase in intra-group aggression levels (e.g. Brennan et al. 1985), and increased human-animal conflict (e.g. Brennan et al. 1985, Altmann & Muruthi 1988), all of which may have negative consequences for the primate individuals involved. Furthermore, provisioning may result in a decrease in the efficiency of primates in dispersing seeds, thereby indirectly altering the entire ecosystem (Sengupta et al. 2015). This intervention aims to prevent primates from consuming human food waste by removing it before it can serve as potential food sources to primates.

1562: Reduce noise pollution by restricting development activities to certain times of the day/night  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Noise pollution is produced by motorized vehicles, trains and planes on and near transportation routes, resource extraction activities (i.e. mining, logging), motorized recreation (i.e. ‘driving-safaris’) and urban development. Noise pollution can cause hearing loss, elevated stress hormone levels, and hypertension in humans and other animals. This in turn, can affect animal foraging and anti-predator behaviour, reproductive success, population density and community structure (Barber et al. 2010). Therefore, this intervention restricts noise to only certain periods of the day to reduce the potential effect of noise pollution on the primate species of interest. For example, development activities may be limited to times of the day/night where the primate is active (depending on the species), so that it can rest during quiet time periods. Alternatively/additionally, it may be decided that development activities are prohibited during sensitive time periods, such as the mating season or hibernation, during which it is crucial that the species can vocalize effectively and efficiently and is not exposed to any additional stress factors.

1571: Implement multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, discussions  
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There are different types of media that can be used to inform people and raise their awareness about threats to primates and their conservation. Environmental education campaigns frequently use film or print media, theatre plays, group discussions, or a combination of these. For example, Mujaasi et al. (2006) found that after an education programme that involved lectures, distributed working papers, cross word puzzles, discussions, debates, and a visit to the Limbe Wildlife Centre in Cameroon where a wide variety of primate orphans, including chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla were housed, was implemented, students were able to list at least three endangered primate species in Cameroon. They also learnt which human activities had negative impact on the environment and many agreed that keeping primates as pets was wrong. An education and outreach programme implemented by CERCOPAN, a non-profit, non-governmental sanctuary, resulted in increased knowledge of students about primates after participating in the programme. The data also showed that the number of students that thought that primates made good pets, decreased significantly after participating in the programme and students were able to give examples of why primates should remain in the wild (Akparawa 2006). The results of an evaluation study of an education programme implemented across 14 schools outside the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda (Kuhar et al. 2010) demonstrated both long-term consistency in the effectiveness of delivering conservation-related knowledge and long-term retention of that information. Another study from Uganda showed that the ‘Great Ape Education Project’ designed to educate children and rural communities about the threats to great apes through ape-focused conservation films and supporting educational materials (magazines, brochures, posters), resulted in children being able to identify with and frequently cheer on the main characters in the film and encouraging them to save the great apes in their communities (Slavin 2014).
            The above studies were not included in the synopsis, because their measure of effectiveness of the intervention was too indirect (Mujaasi et al. 2006), the study was not available as a full-text document thus lacking detailed information on results (Akparawa 2006), or the intervention did not specifically address primate species (Kuhar et al. 2010).

1574: Integrate religion/local taboos into conservation education  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Several studies have demonstrated the positive influence that taboos may have on primate populations (Colding & Folke 2001, Jones et al. 2008, Jimoh et al. 2012). Religion may also contribute to the protection of particular primate species. For example, Muslims do not generally consume chimpanzee Pan troglodytes/primate meat (East et al. 2005, Costa 2010). This, however, does not necessarily imply that Muslims do not kill primates for example to sell the meat to those who eat it, or to control crop-raiding (Brugiere & Magassouba 2009). This intervention integrates religion/local taboos into conservation education programmes to re-enforce/strengthen local taboos against the killing and consumption of primates.

1577: Create buffer zones around protected primate habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Buffer zones are areas peripheral to a specific protected area, where restrictions on resource use and special development measures are undertaken in order to enhance the conservation value of the protected area. Buffer zones therefore act as a transition zone between the protected area where no/very limited resource use is permitted and the area outside the protected area where no resource use restrictions are enforced. Buffer zones have been suggested as a particularly suitable practice for climate change mitigation, as they may facilitate the shifting of populations from reserves to adjacent areas according to the climatic needs of species.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of creating buffer zones around protected primate habitat on primate populations.

1578: Legally protect primate habitat  
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Efforts to reduce habitat destruction rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. However, conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas can be biased, because protection is not randomly assigned and because humans can respond to protection in one location by changing land uses in neighboring locations, and thereofore protection can induce habitat destruction of neighboring forests. Such ‘spillovers’ can also be positive, for example enhanced law enforcement on private lands or establishment of private reserves nearby (Andam et al. 2008). Andam and colleagues (2008) controlled for these biases and found that in 1960-1997 about 10% of the protected forests in Costa Rica would have been deforested had they not been protected. Protection therefore seems to reduce deforestation, but does it also protect primate populations? A correlative study in northern Republic of Congo by Stokes et al. (2010) compared wildlife densities and distributions among areas with varying degrees of conservation management. The authors found that both elephant Loxodonta africana and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes density decreased with increasing distance to Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park, the only protected area included in their study. The study found no permanent human habitation or roads and no sign of poaching in the national park during their survey. Furthermore, a modelling and decision analysis study that compared two conservation strategies for orangutans Pongo spp., namely rehabilitation and reintroduction of ex-captive or displaced individuals; and protection of their forest habitat, found that reintroduction, which costs twelve times as much per animal as compared to protection of forest, was only a cost-effective strategy at very short timescales. For time scales longer than 10-20 years, forest protection was the more cost-efficient strategy for maintaining wild orangutan populations (Wilson et al. 2014).

1580: Create/protect habitat corridors  
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Corridors are areas of natural habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones) and enable particular plant and animal species to disperse and migrate, processes which are necessary for their survival (Rouget et al. 2006). For example, a simulation study by Bruford et al. (2010) examined the genetic implications of management options for the highly fragmented orangutan population in the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Malaysia and demonstrated that a combination of modest translocation rates (one individual every 20 years) and corridor establishment enabled even the most isolated subpopulations to retain demographic stability and constrain localised inbreeding to small levels. Simiarily, a study in Kenya (Anderson et al. 2007) found that perennial plantations of cashew nut, mango or coconut as well as timber plantations and remnants of indigenous shrubland vegetation were frequently used by Angolan black-and-white colobus Colobus angolensis palliatus to move between fragments of their main coastal forest habitats.

1581: Create/protect forest patches in highly fragmented landscapes  
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of primate populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas of habitat, populations become isolated, which in turn can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Creating/protecting patches of suitable primate habitat (e.g. forest patches) in highly fragmented landscapes may enable them to move between these different areas and help maintain primate populations. Some primate species, such as chimpanzees Pan troglodytes (e.g. McLennan 2008), orangutans Pongo spp. (e.g. Spehar & Rayadin 2017), or samango monkeys Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus (e.g. Nowak et al. 2017) show very high behavioural flexibility enabling them to survive in human-modified landscapes. However, it remains to be seen whether such populations will also survive in the long-term.

1582: Demarcate and enforce boundaries of protected areas  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Demarcation is the act of creating a boundary around a place, in this case a protected area. To be able to define the spatial limits of important primate habitat to be protected, it is important that the distribution and possibly abundance of the primate species is known (e.g. through survey work). Protected area boundaries can then be demarcated by physical structures, such as fences (not to keep primates in, but to keep people or livestock out), by raising awareness programmes involving communities bordering these boundaries, or by drawing the boundary only on the map. The enforcement of boundaries can be done by maintaining the physical boundary demarcation, boundary patrols by law enforcement guards, and/or continuous education of local people to environmental issues and protection. A correlative study that assessed the impacts of anthropogenic threats on 93 protected areas in 22 tropical countries found that the degree of border demarcation correlated with management effectiveness (Bruner et al. 2001). Another correlative study in northern Congo found that elephant Loxodonta africana and chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes density decreased with increasing distance outside the NNNP boundary. Chimpanzee density decreased rapidly outside the national park up to a distance of 40 km and increased rapidly inside its boundary. Elephant density within the national park boundary and at short distances up to about 20 km outside its border was relatively stable, but then decreased rapidly with increasing distance away from national park boundary. In contrast, gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla density increased with increasing distance outside the park boundary, up to distances of approximately 100 km (Stokes et al. 2010).

As an alternative to protecting natural habitat for primates, restoring damaged habitats or creating new habitat patches may help to maintain/increase primate populations. Habitat restoration or creation is often required by law as a response to mining or other activities that destroy large areas of natural habitats. This intervention may entail planting vegetation, removing invasive species, or creating shelter habitats and sleeping sites for example.

1584: Plant indigenous trees to re-establish natural tree communities in clear-cut areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the planting of indigenous trees to re-establish natural tree communities after clear-cutting. It should be noted, however, that planting trees will almost always be more expensive than preserving natural forests from clear-cutting and that natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests (which is not to say that primates cannot survive in young regrowth forest). In addition, it can take centuries and even millennia for the forest to regrow to its pre-disturbance state. For example, an Atlantic rainforest needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of animal-dispersed species (80% of the species), the proportion of non-pioneer species (90%) and of understorey species (50%) found in mature forests. On the other hand, much more time is necessary (between one and four thousand years) to reach the endemism levels (40% of the species) that exist in mature forests (Liebsch et al. 2008). Therefore, this intervention should only be considered if the natural habitat is already lost or if preserving it will not be possible.

1586: Plant indigenous fast-growing trees (will not necessarily resemble original community) in clear-cut areas  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the planting of indigenous fast-growing trees after clear-cutting. Because the focus of this intervention is to regrow a forest in a relatively short period of time with the aid of fast-growing indigenous trees, the planted forest will not necessarily resemble the original forest community when it has fully regrown. In addition, it should be noted that natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests. Therefore, this intervention should only be considered if the natural habitat is already lost or if preserving it will not be possible.
            In terms of facilitating the establishment and growth of indigenous tree species in severely degraded areas, plantations of fast-growing trees have been shown to facilitate the establishment and growth of indigenous tree species. For example, Zanne & Chapman (2001) found that five plantations in Kibale National Park in Uganda had higher tree species richness and stem density than nearby human-modified grasslands from which they were derived.

We therefore separated the scientific evidence for captive breeding and subsequent reintroductions into three different interventions, which refer to different methodological approaches (see sections 12.21-12.23):
1) ‘Captive breeding and reintroduction of primates into the wild: Born and reared in cages’
2) ‘Captive breeding and reintroduction of primates into the wild: Limited free-ranging experience’
3) ‘Captive breeding and reintroduction of primates into the wild: Born and raised in a free-ranging environment’

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Brazil found that only two out of three reintroduced black lion tamarins survived over four months, despite being raised in a free-ranging environment, alongside other interventions.
One controlled study in Madagascar found that the diet of reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs that were born and raised in a free-ranging environment alongside other interventions, overlapped with that of wild lemurs.

1597: Rehabilitate injured/orphaned primates 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
When primates are injured or orphaned, rehabilitating them (e.g. at a sanctuary or other facility) may increase their chance of survival. For example, primate infants are frequently captured to be sold via the illegal pet trade and many such primates underwent severe physiological and psychological stressors and thus need intensive care after being confiscated. Rehabilitation can include all activities from rescuing injured/orphaned primates, providing medical/psychological care, raising orphans, to fostering behaviour and reintroducing them back into the wild.
            The fostering of certain behaviours to facilitate the species’ survival in the wild (e.g. foraging, hunting, nest building, climbing) is discussed separately under ‘Fostering appropriate behaviour to facilitate rehabilitation’ and the reintroduction of primates back into the wild, using slightly different methodologies, is discussed under ‘Reintroduce primates in groups’, ‘Reintroduce primates as single/multiple individuals’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is absent’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat where the species is present’, ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat without predators’ and ‘Reintroduce primates into habitat with predators’.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years, despite being rehabilitated, alongside other interventions. Two before-and-after studies in South Africa found that most reintroduced vervet monkeys survived over six months after being rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions.
Two before-and-after studies in the Republic of Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees survived over 3.5–5 years after undergoing pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions. One study in The Gambia found that numbers of reintroduced chimpanzees that underwent pre-release rehabilitation, alongside other interventions, increased by 38% over 25 years.
One review on bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas in 13 African countries found that rehabilitated bonobos living in sanctuaries did not reproduce but the reproductive rate of chimpanzees was 14% and of gorillas was 2%.
One controlled study in Indonesia found that Bornean agile gibbons that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, behaved similarly to wild gibbons.
One controlled study in Malaysia found that numbers of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years, despite orangutans being rehabilitated before release. One controlled study in Indonesia found that most translocated orangutans that were rehabilitated before release, along with other interventions, survived over three months.
One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Congo and Gabon found that most western lowland gorillas that were rehabilitated before release, alongside other interventions, survived over four years. One before-and-after study in Gabon found that one out of two western lowland gorillas that were reintroduced died despite being rehabilitated, alongside other interventions.

1600: Fostering appropriate behaviour to facilitate rehabilitation 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the context of this primate synopsis, fostering refers to promoting behaviour in primates by human care-takers likely to increase their chance of survival post-reintroduction to the wild. Behaviours that may be included here are foraging on natural foods, hunting, climbing and other locomotive behaviours, building nests, grooming and other social behaviours, etc.

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over 1–7 years, despite being fostered to survive in the wild, alongside other interventions but in one study they reproduced successfully which partly compensated mortality.
Two before-and-after studies in Liberia and Congo found that most reintroduced chimpanzees that were fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions, survived over 1-3.5 years. One before-and-after study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements despite being fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions.
One controlled study in Indonesia found that reintroduced orangutans that were fostered natural behaviour, alongside other interventions, did not act more like wild orangutans than individuals that were not fostered. One study in Indonesia found that reintroduced orangutans that were fostered to facilitate reintroduction, alongside other interventions, fed on fewer plant species and spent more time building nests.
One site comparison study in Vietnam found that all reintroduced pygmy slow lorises were assumed dead despite being fostered natural behaviour prior to release, alongside other interventions.
