2742: Modify aquaculture gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be attracted to aquaculture systems to feed and can subsequently become entangled in gear. Modifications to aquaculture gear, such as using stiffened or rigid materials, may reduce the risk of entanglement. This may also reduce mammal predation on fish stocks thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of modifying aquaculture gear on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

2743: Modify anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anti-predator nets may be placed around fish pens or cages to physically exclude marine or freshwater mammals to reduce predation. However, such nets may entangle mammals, causing injury or death (e.g. Díaz López et al. 2007).  Reducing mesh size, using stiffened or tensioned materials, and/or enclosing nets at the bottom may reduce the risk of entanglement (Kemper et al. 2003). These measures may also deter mammal predation more effectively thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.

2754: Divert shipping routes
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Diverting shipping routes away from important areas for marine and freshwater mammals may reduce the risk of lethal collisions (Vanderlaan et al. 2009, van der Hoop et al. 2012, Chion et al. 2018). Diversions may be permanent or temporary (e.g. seasonal or in response to mammal sightings), mandatory or voluntary, and may apply to all vessels or to certain vessel types or sizes. Careful planning may be required as diverting shipping routes to avoid one species could increase the collision risk for other species in new areas (Redfern et al. 2013). Enforcement may also be required if compliance is low.
This intervention is often combined with vessel speed restrictions, see Set and enforce vessel speed limits.

2755: Use observers on board vessels to detect mammals and allow vessel course or speed to be altered
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Trained, dedicated observers on board vessels may be used to alert crew to the presence of marine or freshwater mammals within shipping lanes so that avoidance measures can be taken, such as slowing the vessel or changing course. Dedicated observers have been found to detect more marine mammals than standard vessel crew and often at larger distances from the vessel (Weinrich et al. 2010). However, the ability of observers to detect mammals will depend on the environmental conditions and speed of the vessel, among other factors, and collisions may still occur if mammals are not seen or seen too late to take avoidance measures (Wiley et al. 2016).

2761: Use acoustic devices on moving vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
With the aim of reducing collisions, acoustic devices may be mounted on the bow of moving vessels, such as ships, to deter marine and freshwater mammals. Although large vessels emit high levels of noise, there may be a quieter area or ‘acoustic shadow’ directly in front of vessels due to shielding of noise by the ship’s hull, and also at the water surface (Trevorrow & Vasiliev 2008). Acoustic devices may also be useful for deterring mammals from quieter vessels, such as sailing yachts. However, it should be noted that high amplitude acoustic devices may cause hearing damage to target and non-target mammal species, and may disrupt biologically important behaviour or exclude mammals from important habitats (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002, Götz & Janik 2013).

2765: Introduce regulations for flying aircraft over marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be disturbed by aircraft flying overhead, such as helicopters and small airplanes (Richardson et al. 1997, Patenaude et al. 2006). Underwater noise pollution from commercial passenger airplanes is also likely to be audible to marine mammals and may be of conservation concern for species inhabiting coastal waters close to airports (Erbe et al. 2018). This intervention involves introducing regulations for flying aircraft over marine and freshwater mammals to reduce disturbance. This may include setting limits on minimum altitude and the duration or number of flights over individual mammal groups.

2774: Replace or repair damaged anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Anti-predator nets may be placed around fish pens and cages to physically exclude marine or freshwater mammals to reduce predation and human-wildlife conflict. However, such nets may entangle mammals causing injury or death.  Frequently replacing or repairing anti-predator nets may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled within holes or loose sections of damaged nets (Kemper et al. 2003). This may also prevent mammals from breaching the nets thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.
For studies that involve modifying anti-predator nets, see Modify anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems.

2775: Use acoustic devices at aquaculture systems
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Acoustic devices may be used to deter marine or freshwater mammals from aquaculture systems. These are high power devices that operate by emitting sounds of an intensity and frequency that are aversive to the target mammal species. The primary aim has usually been to reduce mammal predation on fish stocks and damage to gear (therefore reducing human-wildlife conflict), although the risk of mammal entanglement may also be reduced. However, the high intensity sounds produced by acoustic devices have the potential to cause hearing damage to target species (Götz & Janik 2013). Negative and far-reaching effects have also been reported for non-target marine mammal species, such as killer whales and harbour porpoises (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002). The use of multiple acoustic devices within an area has the potential to cause significant noise pollution (Findlay et al. 2018).

2777: Set and enforce vessel speed limits
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Introducing vessel speed limits may reduce disturbance and the risk of lethal collisions and severe injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Vanderlaan & Taggart 2007, Currie et al.  2017, Chion et al. 2018). Speed limits may be permanent, seasonal (e.g. during migration, breeding, or nursing periods) or temporary (e.g. in response to mammal sightings within an area) and may apply to all vessels or to certain vessel types or sizes. Speed limits may also be mandatory or voluntary, although greater compliance has been reported with mandatory speed limits (Lagueux et al. 2011). Enforcement may be required if compliance is low (Silber et al. 2014). 
This intervention is often combined with changes to shipping routes, see Divert shipping routes.

2780: Prohibit or restrict hunting of marine and freshwater mammal species
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may be hunted for their meat, oil, furs, or skins. Historically, hunting of marine mammals has occurred worldwide and has resulted in population declines of many species, and in some cases extinctions (Reeves 2009). This intervention involves prohibiting or restricting hunting specifically where hunting is a major threat to a population of a species. Enforcement may also be required as illegal hunting may still occur (e.g. Consentino & Fisher 2016).

Background information and definitions:
Limiting the number of fishing vessels or days in which an area can be fished may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This may involve the rotation of fishing areas. Careful planning may be required to ensure that fishing effort is not redirected to other areas with a high mammal density.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

Background information and definitions:
Reducing the duration of time that fishing gear is in the water (‘soak time’) may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This may include reducing the amount of time that gear is used for active fishing, as well as avoiding leaving static gear in place when not being fished, e.g. to store gear or reserve a fishing patch.

2797: Use weakened fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using weakened fishing gear may allow entangled or hooked marine and freshwater mammals to release themselves more easily. This may involve using nets and ropes with a reduced breaking strength (e.g. Knowlton et al. 2016), or weak links between fishing lines, buoys, or net panels. The bending strength of hooks may be decreased to a level that retains the target catch but allows caught mammals to release themselves by straightening the hook (sometimes referred to as ‘weak hooks’; Bayse & Kerstetter 2010, Bigelow et al. 2012). However, mammals may still be injured by weakened gear, and it is important to assess the survival of released animals (McLellan et al. 2014). This intervention may also increase the amount of debris and derelict fishing gear in marine and freshwater environments.

2803: Use a larger mesh size for fishing trap-nets
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Trap-nets are stationary nets that have a series of net chambers, which fish can enter but not easily escape from. It has been suggested that using a larger mesh size for trap-nets may discourage marine and freshwater mammals, such as seals, from feeding on trapped fish, which may reduce the risk of entanglement as well as human-wildlife conflict. Fish chased by mammals could escape through a larger mesh and would be less likely to become entangled in the side panels of the trap-net. This may make trap-nets less attractive to feeding mammals.

One study evaluated the effects on freshwater mammals of using a larger mesh size for fishing trap-nets. The study was in the River Indal (Sweden).

Background information and definitions:
Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials, such as nylon infused with chemicals or metal oxides, may increase the detectability of gear for marine and freshwater mammals that use echolocation. This may allow mammals to avoid fishing gear reducing the risk of entanglements. However, it should be noted that using gear materials that are acoustically reflective can also change the density, stiffness and/or colour of the gear, making it difficult to determine which mechanism is causing a deterrent effect (Larsen et al. 2007, Mooney et al. 2007).

2808: Use acoustic devices on fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Acoustic devices (sometimes referred to ‘pingers’) may be deployed on fishing gear to deter marine or freshwater mammals. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in fishing gear. Mammal predation on fish catches may also decrease, which may reduce human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. However, acoustic devices should be used with caution as the effects can span large distances and mammals may be deterred from important habitats or migration routes (Carlström et al. 2009). The use of multiple acoustic devices in an area may also have cumulative effects (Findlay et al. 2018).
Studies have been included that tested acoustic devices on both active and simulated fishing gear. For similar interventions, see Use acoustic devices on fishing vessels and Use acoustic devices on moorings.

2819: Use noise aversive conditioning to deter mammals from fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Aversive conditioning is the process of associating a negative stimulus with a secondary behaviour or outcome. For this intervention, it involves associating a negative stimulus (a loud startling sound) with a neutral one (a non-startling sound) when marine and freshwater mammals are carrying out undesirable behaviour (predating on fish catches) to the extent that the neutral stimulus alone deters this behaviour. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in fishing gear. Mammal predation on fish catches may also decrease, which may reduce human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. The study summarised below tested the effects of the first step of this approach only, i.e. pairing a negative stimulus with a neutral one.

Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Catch and hook protection devices may be used to cover caught fish and hooks during hauling to reduce predation by marine and freshwater mammals and the subsequent capture of mammals. This may include ‘net sleeves’ which cover caught fish and hooks with the downward pressure of hauling, or triggered devices (e.g. chains, cages, cones etc.) that automatically release when a fish is hooked. This may prevent mammal injury or death due to hooking. A reduction in mammal predation on fish catches may also reduce human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries.

Reduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (1 study): One study in the South Pacific Ocean found that using cage or chain devices on fishing hooks resulted in fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales.
Human-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Two of four studies (including three controlled and one before-and-after study) in the South Pacific Ocean, the Southwest Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean found that net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to fish catches by sperm whales, killer whales and toothed whales. The two other studies found that attaching ‘umbrella’ or ‘spider’ devices on fishing hooks did not reduce predation and/or damage to fish catches by sperm whales or toothed whales. One controlled study in the Indian Ocean found that attaching catch protection devices made from streamers to fishing lines reduced Indo-Pacific bottlenose and spinner dolphin predation on fish bait, but only during the first two trials.

2822: Modify fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may predate on catches in fishing pots and traps, which can result in mammals being trapped or entangled. Modifying traps to exclude mammals may reduce this risk. Losses to fishers and damage to gear may also be reduced, thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict at wild fisheries. Methods to exclude mammals may include changing the pot/trap configuration, securing pot/trap doors, using strengthened materials, or adding a physical device (sometimes referred to as a ‘Depredation Mitigation Device’) to prevent entry, such as a metal grid or rods.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects on marine mammals of modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals. Two studies were in the North Sea (UK, Sweden) and one study was in each of the Indian River Lagoon (USA), the Gulf of Finland (Finland), the Bothnian Sea (Finland), the Indian Ocean (Australia) and the Baltic Sea (Sweden).

Reduction in entanglements/unwanted catch (2 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the Indian Ocean, and the Baltic Sea and North Sea found that installing steel rods on lobster pots or metal frames on fishing pots reduced the number of Australian sea lion pups or grey seals and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots.
Human wildlife conflict (4 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated study) in the Bothnian Sea and the North Sea found that installing wire grids or steel bars on fishing trap-nets or bag-nets, along with strengthened netting or other modifications to prevent seal access, reduced damage to salmon catches by seals. One controlled study in the Indian River Lagoon found that one of two methods of securing crab pot doors with a bungee cord reduced the number of common bottlenose dolphin interactions. One controlled study in the Gulf of Finland found that installing wire grids on trap-nets, along with strengthened netting, resulted in higher catches of undamaged salmon but not whitefish, likely due to reduced seal predation.

2823: Install exclusion and/or escape devices for mammals on fishing nets
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may become trapped or entangled in fishing nets, such as trawl nets. Exclusion devices, such as rigid or flexible grids, are designed to prevent access to mammals while allowing the target species to pass through into the narrow end (‘cod-end’) of the net. Escape holes may be installed in the top or bottom of the net in combination with exclusion devices to allow mammals to exit. However, exclusion devices may cause injury or distress to mammals and it is important to assess the survival of animals after escape (Hamilton & Baker 2015).

Background information and definitions:
Legislation has been put in place in some countries to prohibit or restrict the use of certain types of fishing gear or methods that are harmful to marine and freshwater mammals. However, illegal fishing activities may still occur (e.g. Tudela et al. 2005). This intervention involves enforcing existing legislation to reduce illegal fishing with gear types or methods that are harmful to mammals. This may involve measures such as deploying patrol boats, introducing vessel monitoring procedures (such as onboard human observers or CCTV), establishing stricter port controls, reporting of fishing effort, and issuing fines and penalties for non-compliance. Local communities may also be involved, e.g. by reporting illegal fishing activities (Butler et al. 2017).

2847: Introduce regulations for flying drones over marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Aerial drones (also known as ‘Unmanned Aerial Vehicles’) may be used for research and monitoring of marine and freshwater mammals, or for recreational activities. However, flying drones over mammals may cause disturbance and elicit an avoidance response (e.g. Ramos et al. 2018). Introducing regulations for the use of aerial drones in proximity to mammals may reduce disturbance. This could involve setting minimum flight heights, avoiding direct approaches, minimising flight times above the same group of animals, avoiding flights over animals with young, using camouflaged or low-noise devices and/or aborting flights if disturbance occurs.

2853: Limit, cease or prohibit ballast water exchange in specific areas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ballasting is the process by which sea water (ballast water) is discharged from a ship when at port or at sea. Ballast water can contain species from other locations taken up during water intake, which are then accidentally released in a new environment during de-ballasting (water release). Ballast water is one of the major processes of introduction of invasive or problematic species, including those that form harmful algal blooms (Barry et al. 2008, Molnar et al. 2008). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting ballast water exchange in specific areas may help prevent the introduction, establishment and spread of invasive and problematic species. This may involve setting zones where ballasting is allowed, setting timings for ballasting when risk is reduced, or setting limits on the number of ships allowed to ballast in an area.

Background information and definitions:
Some sewer systems collect rainwater runoff, sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe, where it is then transported to a sewage treatment plant. During heavy rainfall events or snow melt, the volume of wastewater can exceed the capacity of treatment facilities. In such instances, sewer systems can overflow and discharge untreated storm water and wastewater directly into rivers and seas (Moffa 1997). Untreated wastewater reaching aquatic environments may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria and viruses, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting the amount of untreated storm and wastewaters overflowing, for instance by increasing the capacity of treatment facilities, may reduce pollution levels and associated risks to marine and freshwater mammals.

Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can cause serious harm to marine and freshwater mammals (Helm et al. 2014). The control and remediation of oil spills can be undertaken in a multitude of ways, e.g. using booms (floating barriers that contain a spill to a delimited zone) and skimmers (devices that collect oil) to remove oil from the water surface, dispersants that break oil into small droplets, sorbents (materials that adsorb oil), or by controlled burning of the oil (Dave & Ghaly 2011). Different methods have different outcomes and side-effects, but when successful may potentially reduce the risks of toxicity and direct harm to marine and freshwater mammals.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals affected by oil spills may be rescued, rehabilitated, and released back into the wild. One study in the USA reported that a live-stranded dolphin was successfully de-oiled at a rehabilitation facility using vegetable oil and detergent and subsequently survived (Wilkin et al. 2017). However, the dolphin was considered unsuitable for release due to its young age and was kept in captivity.

2875: Set regulatory ban on marine burial of nuclear waste
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The disposal of nuclear and radioactive waste at sea was practised by 13 countries from 1946 until 1993, when it was banned following international treaties. However, enforcement is lacking in parts of the world, where illegal dumping is reported to occur. Disposal within the sediment (sub-sea burial) is currently prohibited but has been proposed by various countries and may be an option in the future (Hollister & Nadis 1998). Setting pre-emptive regulatory bans on the sub-sea burial of nuclear waste may help prevent the occurrence of associated threats to marine mammals.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Chemicals are often used in agriculture, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. They are designed to have long-lasting effects on living organisms, are often toxic to non-target species, and as such are a major source of pollution and toxicity in aquatic environments (Jepson et al. 2016). Agricultural run-off, including excess nutrients and toxic substances, can reach rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Reducing the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers in agriculture may reduce pollution levels and associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.

Background information and definitions:
Agricultural and forestry effluents, which may contain chemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients, solid particles, and sediment, can enter rivers and other watercourses, and be discharged into the sea. Artificial wetlands may be created with the aim of retaining such pollution. For example, solid particles and sediment may sink in areas of slow water flow and plants growing on wetlands may remove excess nutrients (Brix 1994). Creating artificial wetlands near agricultural lands or forestry plantations may reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.

Background information and definitions:
Agricultural and forestry effluents, which may contain chemicals, bacteria, excess nutrients, solid particles, and sediment, can enter rivers and other watercourses, and be discharged into the sea. Riparian buffers (uncultivated strips of vegetation along waterways) may be created to help reduce diffuse pollution from agriculture and forestry. For example, trees and plants within riparian buffers may trap sediments and solid particles and uptake excess nutrients (Collins et al. 2009). Establishing riparian buffers in agricultural and forestry areas may reduce the amount of pollutants reaching rivers and the sea, and therefore reduce the associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Intensive agriculture constitutes a major source of pollution to marine and freshwater environments. Agricultural waste and pollutants can enter rivers and other watercourses and be discharged into the sea. Excess nutrients from agricultural waste can lead to diminished water quality and eutrophication events, including harmful algal blooms. Some species used in aquaculture can naturally improve water quality through feeding (e.g. filter feeding species, such as mussels) or through photosynthesis (e.g. algae species). Establishing certain types of aquaculture near polluted areas may be an effective method for the removal of excess nutrients (Duarte & Krause-Jensen 2018).

2885: Use biodegradable fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (or ‘ghost’ gear) is a major threat to marine and freshwater mammals. Mammals may become entangled in ‘ghost’ gear, such as nets, lines and ropes, resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Synthetic materials used for fishing gear, such as nylon, may persist for decades leading to an accumulation of ‘ghost’ gear in marine and freshwater environments. Using biodegradable materials, which are naturally broken down by microbes or ultraviolet light, may reduce the persistence of ‘ghost’ gear in the environment (Kim et al. 2016), and therefore reduce the risk of mammal entanglement. The degraded products of biodegradable materials (carbon dioxide, methane, water) also have no impact on marine ecosystems, unlike synthetic materials which eventually degrade into microplastics.

Background information and definitions:
Commercial and recreational vessels can generate large amounts of garbage and solid waste (Butt 2007). Wastes discharged overboard can pollute marine and freshwater environments through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, solid particles, and litter. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area may reduce or stop the source of pollution, and therefore reduce associated impacts on marine and freshwater mammals. However, solid waste can accumulate and persist in aquatic environments for a long time due to slow degradation (Pham et al. 2014, Andrady 2015), therefore this intervention alone may not be sufficient.

2896: Use acoustic devices to deter marine and freshwater mammals from an area to reduce noise exposure
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Activities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving, dredging, explosives and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). Acoustic devices may be used to deter marine or freshwater mammals from an area prior to commencing such activities to reduce potential harm. However, it should be noted that high amplitude acoustic devices may cause hearing damage to target and non-target mammal species, and may disrupt biologically important behaviour or exclude mammals from important habitats (Johnston 2002, Morton & Symonds 2002, Olesiuk et al. 2002, Götz & Janik 2013).

2897: Use ‘soft start’ procedures to deter marine and freshwater mammals to reduce noise exposure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Activities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). ‘Soft start’ (or ‘ramp up’) procedures may be used when commencing such activities to gradually increase the sound intensity over a period of time. The aim is to deter marine and freshwater mammals from the area before the full volume is reached so that noise exposure and the risk of injury are reduced (Von Benda-Beckmann et al. 2014). For example, seismic surveys may commence with a single airgun, with additional airguns activated over a period of time until the full array is operational. However, this relies on mammals having an avoidance response. Some mammals may be attracted to initially weak sounds and thus exposed to potentially harmful levels as the sound intensity increases (Compton et al. 2008). ‘Soft-start’ procedures may also prolong the total duration of operations, possibly increasing the total amount of acoustic energy that is transmitted into the environment.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (3 studies): One study in various water bodies around the UK found that a greater proportion of cetaceans (including whales, dolphins and porpoise) avoided or moved away from vessels during ‘soft start’ procedures with seismic airguns compared to when airguns were not firing. One study in the South Atlantic Ocean found that during ‘soft start’ procedures using seismic airguns, a pod of short-finned whales initially moved away but remained within 900 m of the vessel as it passed by. One study in the South Pacific Ocean found that during ‘soft-start’ procedures with a small experimental airgun array, migrating humpback whales slowed their speed towards the vessel but did not significantly alter their course.

Background information and definitions:
Activities that produce large amounts of underwater noise, such as seismic airgun surveys, pile driving, dredging, explosives and sonar, may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003, Bailey et al. 2010). Delaying or ceasing such activities for a specified time if marine or freshwater mammals are detected within an ‘exclusion’ zone may help to reduce negative impacts and the risk of injury. This may involve using trained observers, acoustic monitoring and/or automated systems to detect mammals (Verfuss et al. 2018).

Background information and definitions:
Airguns used for seismic surveys produce high intensity sounds that may disturb or cause auditory injury to marine and freshwater mammals (Gordon et al. 2003). Using alternative ‘quieter’ methods instead of airguns for seismic surveys may reduce these impacts. For example, a method called marine vibroseis, which uses lower intensity sounds over a longer duration, may reduce some of the impacts on marine mammals (Richardson & Ellison 2013).

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Underwater noise from vessels can disturb marine and freshwater mammals and may cause behavioural changes and stress (Erbe et al. 2018). Modifications may be made to vessels to reduce noise pollution. This may involve using alternative propellor, rudder or hull designs, or ‘quieting’ technologies, such as electric propulsion. Onboard machinery (e.g. engines, generators, pumps) may also be modified to reduce noise pollution. For example, machinery may be relocated within the vessel, attached to resilient mounts or surrounded by sound dampening materials (International Maritime Organization 2014).
Reducing vessel speeds may also reduce noise pollution. See Set and enforce vessel speed limits.

Background information and definitions:
Commercial, recreational, industrial, and military vessels can generate large amounts of liquid waste, such as sewage, grey waters, and bilge waters (Welles 2003). Discharge of these wastes overboard can impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances, and solid particles. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the discharge of waste overboard from vessels in an area can potentially reduce or stop the source of pollution.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Antifouling paints and coatings are commonly used to manage ‘biofouling’ (organisms that attach to hard surfaces) on aquaculture gear (cages, nets, ponds) and other hard anthropogenic structures. However, some antifouling paints and coatings are highly toxic to aquatic wildlife, including marine and freshwater mammals. Tributyltin (TBT), for example, was widely used on vessels and has been found to accumulate in marine mammal tissues, with potentially lethal effects (Kannan et al. 1997). Using non-toxic or natural antifouling coatings (e.g. Magin et al. 2010, Kirschner & Brennan 2012) may reduce the risk of toxicity to marine and freshwater mammals.

For example, Marine Mammal Protected Area (MMPA) is a term used to define an area that is specially managed for the protection of marine mammals and their habitats (Hoyt 2010). Protected areas may be many different shapes and sizes, and may vary in the number of species protected and the range of threats addressed (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2016).
Assessing the effectiveness of protected areas is particularly difficult as there may be no suitable controls and appropriate replication can be difficult. Effectiveness is also best monitored over long timescales, but this increases the chance that other factors influence the ecosystem.
The studies summarised below are related to legally protected areas or habitats. Evidence related to the legal protection of marine and freshwater mammals from specific threats are described in the chapter on that threat category. For a general intervention related to legally protecting marine mammal species, see Legally protect marine and freshwater mammal species.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of legally protecting habitat for marine and freshwater mammals. One study was in each of the North Atlantic Ocean (Portugal), the South Pacific Ocean (New Zealand), the North Sea (UK) and the Port River estuary (Australia).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that a population of Mediterranean monk seals increased during eight years after the islands they inhabited were legally protected. One before-and-after study in the North Sea found that a population of bottlenose dolphins was estimated to be a similar size before and after part of its range was protected.
Survival (2 studies): One before-and-after study in the South Pacific Ocean found that the survival rate of Hector’s dolphins was higher after a coastal area was legally protected than before. One before-and-after study in the Port River estuary found that after the area became legally protected a similar number of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin strandings were recorded compared to before protection, but the number of strandings caused by humans decreased.

Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Protected areas are usually subject to the influence of human activities in surrounding areas. Retaining or creating buffer zones around important habitats may help to reduce disturbance and degradation on the periphery of protected areas. Buffer zones are usually areas that do not receive full protection and are not subject to the same management intensity of core areas, but in which there may be a degree of limit to activities, such as fishing, shipping or development.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining or creating buffer zones around important habitats on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

2921: Create artificial habitat for marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves creating artificial habitats for marine and freshwater mammals. For example, artificial reefs are structures intentionally built on the seafloor using natural or man-made materials, such as rocks or concrete blocks. These structures may attract a variety of marine life and form reef ecosystems, providing a foraging resource for predatory marine mammals. However, some man-made materials used for artificial reefs, such as scrap tyres, may have toxic effects (Collins et al. 2002). High concentrations of fish at artificial reefs may also attract fishing activities and increase the risk of mammal entanglement in fishing gear.
For a study that restored an existing reef with boulders, see Restore habitat for marine and freshwater mammals. See also Leave anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning.

2922: Leave anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anthropogenic structures on the sea floor, such as pipelines, cable routes, wind turbines and oil rigs, may form ‘artificial reefs’ as they are colonised by marine invertebrates and provide breeding grounds and shelter for fish. This may provide a foraging resource for predatory marine mammals, such as porpoises and seals (e.g. Dähne et al. 2014, Arnould et al. 2015). Leaving such structures in place after decommissioning may therefore be beneficial to some marine mammal species. However, artificial reefs may also act as ‘ecological traps’ for mammal prey, attracting species to less favourable habitats leading to a decrease in fitness (Russell et al. 2014).

2924: Rescue and release stranded or trapped marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals that are found stranded or trapped without significant injury or impairment may be rescued and released back into the wild. Often this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation, although for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities to augment wild populations. The success of rescuing and releasing mammals can be difficult to judge without long-term survival data. It is also important to note that most studies summarised below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are unlikely to have been reported.
Evidence is summarised below for studies that released trapped or stranded mammals immediately. For studies that rescued and rehabilitated mammals in captivity prior to release, see Rehabilitate and release injured, sick or weak marine and freshwater mammals.

Key Messages:

Eleven studies evaluated the effects of rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped marine and freshwater mammals. Five studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA), two studies were in the Indian Ocean (Tasmania, South Africa), and one study was in each of the South Atlantic Ocean (Brazil), the Cachoeira River estuary (Brazil), the North Pacific Ocean (USA) and the Shannon Estuary (Ireland).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (11 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (2 studies): One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that after rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped Hawaiian monk seals, along with at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, more than a quarter of the seals reproduced. One study in the Shannon Estuary found that a stranded common bottlenose dolphin that was rescued and released was observed with a calf a year later.
Survival (11 studies): Seven studies (including one review) in the North Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and the Shannon Estuary found that 17–100% of rescued and released Atlantic white-sided dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, long-finned pilot whales, short-finned pilot whales, and Cape fur seals survived during post-release monitoring periods, which ranged in length from three weeks to three years. Three studies in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Cachoeira estuary and the Indian Ocean found that a trapped rough-toothed dolphin, two stranded tucuxi dolphins and seven stranded sperm whales were successfully rescued and released, although long-term survival was not reported. One review in the North Pacific Ocean found that rescuing and releasing stranded or trapped Hawaiian monk seals, along with at least seven other interventions to enhance survival, resulted in more than a quarter of the seals surviving.

2925: Rehabilitate and release injured, sick or weak marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals that are injured, sick or found in a weak condition may be taken into captivity by wildlife rehabilitators to be treated and released back into the wild. Often this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation, although for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities to augment wild populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without long-term survival data or benchmark data for survival of wild mammals that have not been taken into captivity. It is also important to note that most studies summarised below have small sample sizes, and that unsuccessful attempts are unlikely to have been reported.
Evidence has been summarised below for studies that brought mammals into captivity as part of a rehabilitation programme. For interventions that treat mammals for disease or parasites in the wild or during temporary confinement, see Treat disease in wild marine and freshwater mammals and Use drugs to treat parasites. For studies that rescued and immediately released stranded or trapped mammals, see Rescue and release stranded or trapped marine and freshwater mammals.

Key Messages:

Twenty-seven studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating and releasing injured, sick or weak marine and freshwater mammals. Nine studies were in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA, UK, France), six studies were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), four studies were in the Gulf of Mexico (USA), two studies were in each of the North Sea (the Netherlands) and the Gulf of Maine (USA), and one study was in each of the Indian River Lagoon (USA), Bohai Bay (China), The Wash estuary (UK), water bodies in Florida (USA), El Dorado Lake (Peru), and the Gulf of California (Mexico).

Five studies (including one replicated study) in the North Sea, the North Atlantic Ocean, Bohai Bay and the North Pacific Ocean found that two of three harbour porpoises, 152 of 188 grey seal pups, a common seal, a west Pacific finless porpoise and 14 of 35 California sea lions were successfully rehabilitated and released but survival after release was not reported. One controlled study in the North Pacific Ocean found that at least a quarter of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released back into the wild died or had to be euthanized.

2926: Hand-rear orphaned or abandoned marine and freshwater mammal young
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Young marine and freshwater mammals believed to be orphaned or abandoned are sometimes taken into captivity by wildlife rehabilitators, to be reared and released back into the wild. Often this is done more for animal welfare reasons than for species conservation, although for rare species, release of such animals may provide opportunities to augment wild populations. The success of such programmes can be difficult to judge without long-term survival data or benchmark data for survival of wild-reared mammals.

Key Messages:

Twelve studies evaluated the effects of hand-rearing orphaned or abandoned marine and freshwater mammal young. Four studies were in the North Pacific Ocean (USA), two studies were in captive facilities (USA), and one study was in each of the North Atlantic Ocean (USA), the Indian River Lagoon (USA), the Salish Sea (USA), the Guerrero Lagoon (USA), the South Atlantic Ocean (Brazil) and water bodies in Florida (USA).

Two replicated studies in the South Atlantic Ocean and water bodies in Florida found that approximately three-quarters of Antillean manatees and two-thirds of Florida manatees that were captive-reared and released were known to survive for at least one year, and some survived for more than seven years. Three studies in the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific Ocean and the Guerrero Lagoon found that three West Indian manatee calves, seven Hawaiian monk seal pups and one Antillean manatee calf that were captive-reared either died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived in the wild only with supplemental feeding. Two studies at captive facilities found that a captive-reared grey whale calf and five pygmy and dwarf sperm whale calves increased in body weight but were either not released or died in captivity. One controlled study in the North Pacific Ocean found that captive-reared, released Pacific harbour seal pups had similar survival estimates to wild pups.

2929: Remove individual marine and freshwater mammals exhibiting aggressive behaviours that may limit population recovery
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Individual marine and freshwater mammals may exhibit aggressive behaviours that may limit the recovery of threatened populations. For example, male Hawaiian monk seals Monachus schauinslandi may attack and injure adult females resulting in high levels of female mortality and reduced reproductive success (Hiruki 1993a). Pups of both sexes may also be injured and killed (Hiruki 1993b). Removing such individuals from colonies, e.g. by translocating them to other areas, may help threatened populations to recover. However, careful consideration must be given to appropriate release sites to ensure that the threat is not transferred to other colonies.

2930: Translocate marine and freshwater mammals to re-establish or boost native populations
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught marine and freshwater mammals into the wild to re-establish a population that has been lost or to augment an existing population. This can reduce the risk of inbreeding, help safeguard small populations from extinction due to catastrophic events, and/or increase the range of a species and therefore the maximum possible population. Translocations may also be used to move mammals to areas where the chances of survival are likely to be higher, such as areas with reduced predation or better foraging conditions.
For other interventions related to translocations, see Translocate marine and freshwater mammal species before onset of impactful activities, Translocate mammals away from aquaculture systems to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Translocate or temporarily bring marine and freshwater mammals into captivity to reduce exposure to disease.

Translocations involve the intentional capture, movement and release of wild-caught marine and freshwater mammals into the wild. Translocations may be carried out prior to the onset of impactful activities to reduce harm to mammals. For example, mammals may be translocated away from potential energy production sites prior to construction. However, this may not be feasible where large numbers of animals are affected. There is also the risk of disease transmission, competition and social disruption at the release site (Germano et al. 2015).

2932: Breed marine and freshwater mammals in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding involves taking wild animals into captivity and establishing and maintaining breeding populations. For conservation purposes, it tends to be undertaken when wild populations become very small or fragmented or when they are declining rapidly. Captive populations can be maintained while threats in the wild are reduced or removed and can provide an insurance policy against catastrophe in the wild. Captive breeding also potentially provides a method of increasing reproductive output beyond what would be possible in the wild. However, captive breeding can result in problems associated with inbreeding depression, removal of natural selection, adaptation to captive conditions and familiarity with humans.
The aim is usually to release captive-bred animals back to natural habitats, either to original sites once conditions are suitable, to reintroduce a species to sites that were previously occupied, or to introduce species to new sites. The studies summarised below evaluated the effects of captive-breeding only. For evidence related to the release of captive-bred mammals, see Release captive-bred marine and freshwater mammals.

Survival (4 studies): Two studies in South Africa and the USA found that a captive-born common bottlenose dolphin, and a captive-born and hand-reared common bottlenose dolphin, survived in captivity for at least two and a half years and four years respectively. One review in the USA found that 80% of common bottlenose dolphins born in captivity over two decades survived, and survival increased with improved husbandry techniques. One review in the USA, China, Indonesia and Venezuela found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity.
Condition (1 study): One study in China found that a population of Yangtze finless porpoises breeding in semi-captive conditions had low genetic diversity.

Two studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred marine and freshwater mammals to re-establish or boost native populations. One study was in the Porto de Pedras estuary (Brazil) and one in water bodies in Florida (USA).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two studies in the Porto de Pedras estuary and water bodies in Florida found that two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention.

2934: Engage policymakers to make policy changes beneficial to marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Engaging with and raising awareness amongst policymakers about specific threats to marine and freshwater mammals, and the need for conservation, may result in improved legal protection of mammals and their habitats.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of engaging policymakers to make changes beneficial to marine and freshwater mammals. The study was in the Catazajá wetlands (Mexico).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)

2935: Educate the public to improve behaviour towards marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals face a range of threats from humans. This may include exploitation through hunting or persecution if the mammal is perceived as a threat or nuisance. Education programmes may be designed to educate the public about the importance of marine and freshwater mammals and their conservation to reduce behaviours that are a threat to mammals and to encourage positive behaviours. This may involve a variety of media from broadcasting and social media through to educational events. This may also include educating the public during mammal watching tours. However, careful implementation may be required as unregulated tours can cause considerable disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals (Zapetis et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of educating the public to improve behaviour towards marine and freshwater mammals. One study was in each of the North Atlantic Ocean (USA), the Sundarbans mangroves (Bangladesh) and the South Pacific Ocean (Peru).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Change in human behaviour (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Sundarbans mangroves and the South Pacific Ocean found that after educational whale-watching tours or an educational exhibition, participants were more willing to change their behaviour to support marine conservation, to donate money to marine conservation, or to cut their fishing nets to save entangled dolphins.

2936: Involve local communities in marine and freshwater mammal conservation projects
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
When local communities are involved in conservation projects, they may have a greater interest in ensuring the long-term sustainability of conservation efforts. The engagement of local communities may also reduce persecution of marine and freshwater mammals. One study in Mexico found that local communities were successfully involved in recording sightings and rescuing threatened West Indian manatees Trichechus manatus manatus, although the outcomes for the manatee population were not reported (Rodas-Trejo et al. 2008).

2937: Use biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Biocides are chemical substances or microorganisms used with the intention of controlling an invasive or problematic species. Using biocides or other chemicals, such as chemical inhibitors, to reduce or control invasive or problematic species may lower the risk they pose to marine and freshwater mammals. However, some biocides are toxic and may contaminate marine and freshwater environments.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using biocides or other chemicals to control invasive or problematic species on marine and freshwater mammal populations.
