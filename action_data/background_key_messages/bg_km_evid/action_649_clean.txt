Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Wood pastures are open, low-intensity livestock-grazed woodlands with grassland, often of high conservation value. Due to abandonment or agricultural reversion, they have declined greatly in Europe. This intervention may involve restoring or maintaining wood pasture habitats.
See also ‘Restore or create wood pasture’ for studies on the restoration or establishment of wood pastures.
