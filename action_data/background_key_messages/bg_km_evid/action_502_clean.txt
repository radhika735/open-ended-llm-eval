502: Repair/support nests to support breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If nesting sites are limited then birds may use nests which are not suitable. Rather than move the nests or eggs (see ‘Translocations’), it may be more appropriate to repair or support the nests.
 

Key Messages:
A small study from Puerto Rico found that nine Puerto Rican parrot Amazona vittata nests were repaired, resulting in no chicks dying of cold.
