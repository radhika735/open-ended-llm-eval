1800: Increase ‘on-the-ground’ protection (e.g. rangers)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the use of an ‘on-the-ground’ human presence to protect peatlands from immediate threats. This includes rangers or wardens that may patrol peatlands, ensuring legislation and voluntary agreements are followed. It also includes creating teams to directly manage threats e.g. firefighters.
Key peatland types for which this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: raise awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management; adopt ecotourism principles/create an ecotourism site. 

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland habitats of increasing ‘on-the-ground’ protection. The study was in tropical peat swamps.
Behaviour change (1 study): One before-and-after study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia reported that the number of illegal sawmills decreased over two years of anti-logging patrols.
