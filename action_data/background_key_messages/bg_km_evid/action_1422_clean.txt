1422: Remove and relocate ‘problem’ animals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
So-called ‘problem’ animals are animals that cause damage to humans or their property. Problem causing animals can be captured alive in the area of conflict, and transported and released in another suitable area. Animals are either returned to their normal home range, in the hope that the negative experience will prevent them from returning to the area of conflict, or are transported further, to an area with reduced conflict potential, where it is hoped that they will stay (Linnell et al. 1997).

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in India found that ‘problem’ rhesus monkeys that were translocated, alongside other interventions, survived and remained at the release sites for at least four years.
One controlled, before-and-after study in Kenya found that after 16 years, most crop-raiding olive baboons that were translocated from farmland, alongside other interventions, had survived and had similar survival rates compared to non-translocated populations.
One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Republic of Congo and Gaboon found that 84% of the ‘problem’ western lowland gorillas that were relocated, alongside other interventions, survived for at least four years.
