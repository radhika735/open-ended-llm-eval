559: Provide calcium supplements to increase survival or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Calcium is vital for birds to produce eggshell and to produce strong bones, and parents of dependent young therefore feed chicks on calcium-rich foods and precocial chicks (i.e. those that can walk and forage for themselves) seek out calcium-rich foods.
In acidified environments (e.g. those subject to acid rain) the supply of calcium may be limited, leading to low reproductive success. Therefore providing birds with supplementary calcium in a useable form, frequently fragments of bone or shell may increase reproductive output and the subsequent survival of chicks.
 

Key Messages:

Eight studies from across the world, including a literature review from across the world found evidence for positive effects of calcium supplementation on several bird species. 
Positive effects included lower incidence of bone disease, higher fledging succes, larger broods, higher quality eggs or chicks and better physical condition of female parents. Not all species reacted similarly.
Six studies including a literature review did not find any evidence for increased reproductive success in at least one of the species supplied with supplementary calcium.
One replicated study from Europe found that birds took calcium supplied, and birds at polluted sites took more than those at cleaner sites. The effects on fitness were not monitored.
