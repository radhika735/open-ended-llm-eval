2606: Fit vehicles with ultrasonic warning devices
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Collisions between mammals such as deer and vehicles can result in death or injury to animals and humans alike. For example, it has been estimated that over 1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually in the USA alone (Conover et al. 1995). Wildlife warning whistles are designed to produce high frequency, ultrasonic noises to alert or frighten animals away from oncoming vehicles. Whistles can be mounted on vehicles, with the sound being emitted once the vehicle reaches a certain speed. Alternatively whistles can be mounted on poles or small trees along roads and be activated by headlights of approaching cars.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of fitting vehicles with ultrasonic warning devices. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in Australia found that Shu Roo warning whistles did not reduce animal-vehicle collisions for eastern grey kangaroos or red kangaroos

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (3 studies): Three controlled studies (two replicated), in the USA and Australia, found that ultrasonic warning devices did not deter mule deer, eastern grey kangaroos, red kangaroos or white-tailed deer from roads.
