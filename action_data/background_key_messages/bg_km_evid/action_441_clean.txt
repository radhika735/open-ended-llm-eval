441: Remove/control adult brood parasites 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Brood parasites are species that lay their eggs in other species’ nests, with the chicks cared for by the hosts. They can have extremely detrimental impacts on bird species, with parasite chicks frequently evicting all host eggs or chicks. However, some brood parasite species, such as common cuckoos Cuculus canorus are themselves declining or threatened, making control or the reduction of parasitism undesirable.
However, in North America, brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater are increasingly abundant and expanding in their range. Brown-headed cowbirds have also been implicated in the near extinction of at least one species, the pale-headed brush finch Atlapetes pallidiceps in South America (Oppel et al. 2004), meaning that their control is seen as a conservation priority. All the studies we captured concern cowbird species.

Key Messages:

All 11 studies from across the world that investigated parasitism rates found that they were lower following cowbird Molothrus spp. control.
One study from Ecuador found an increase in host species population after cowbird control, but two American studies found no such effect.
Five studies from the Americas found higher productivities or success rates of host nests when cowbirds were removed, five found that at least some measures of productivity did not change with cowbird control.
