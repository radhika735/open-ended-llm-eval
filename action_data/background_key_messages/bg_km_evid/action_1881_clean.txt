1881: Amphibians: Play recordings of breeding calls to simulate breeding season in the wild
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Calling activity by males is usually prominent in the breeding season and plays an important part in mate selection. Playback of recorded breeding calls may stimulate breeding by increasing competition between males.

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Australia found that frogs only bred when recorded mating calls were played, as well as manipulating the sex ratio after frogs were moved into an indoor enclosure which allowed temporary flooding and had various types of organic substrates.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that clutch size of frogs increased when playing recorded mating calls, along with the sexes being separated in the non-breeding periods, providing female mate choice, and allowing females to increase in weight before breeding.
