1939: Reduce field size (or maintain small fields)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reducing field size (or maintaining small fields) means having a greater number of smaller fields, with boundaries and field margins between them. This would provide heterogeneity within the farmed landscape, and may also increase the density of linear habitat features, such as treelines and hedgerows, which are important for commuting, foraging and roosting bats.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of maintaining small fields on bat populations. The study was in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in CanadaÂ found that agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity (relative abundance) of six of seven bat species than landscapes with larger fields.
