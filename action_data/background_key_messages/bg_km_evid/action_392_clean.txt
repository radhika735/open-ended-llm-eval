Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from New Zealand found that a reintroduced population of New Zealand robins Petroica australis declined without predator control and increased with rat poisoning. Two UK studies, one non-experimental, found increased populations of some species following control of bird and mammal predators.
One replicated, controlled study from New Zealand found lower New Zealand robin survival in areas where rodent bait was broadcast, but no difference with controls when dispensers were used.
Six studies from New Zealand, Australia, UK found increased nest success or survival (in one case with artificial nests) following bird and mammal predator control.
One randomised, replicated and controlled study from the USA found no difference in nest survival in a site with mammalian predator removal.
