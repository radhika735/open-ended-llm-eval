554: Can supplementary feeding increase predation or parasitism?
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding could potentially have deleterious effects on both the target population, for example through spreading disease or drawing birds to feeding areas where they can easily be predated, or non-target species, for example by bringing large numbers of predators into the area.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that providing seeds in predictable areas did not increase predation on seven species of songbird. 
A replicated and controlled trial in Spain found higher levels of potentially dangerous gut microflora when fed on livestock carrion, compared to those fed on wild rabbits. A replicated study in Spain found higher levels of predation on artificial nests close to carcasses provided for vultures.
