763: Use antibacterial treatment to reduce chytridiomycosis infection
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Effective treatments for chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are vital to ensure the success of amphibian captive-breeding programmes. They are also required to reduce the risk of spreading the disease when animals are moved between breeding facilities, released or translocated between field sites.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled study) in New Zealand and Australia found that treatment with chloramphenicol antibiotic ointment (Bishop et al. 2009) or solution, with other interventions in some cases, cured green tree frogs and one Archey’s frog of chytridiomycosis.
One replicated, controlled study found that treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine increased survival time but did not cure blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs of chytridiomycosis.
