313: Use voluntary agreements with local people to reduce disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many people will be willing to avoid certain areas or activities to help local bird populations if they are consulted and kept informed about conservation issues. Under these circumstances, voluntary agreements to avoid birds may be at least as effective in reducing disturbance as restricting access.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after trial in the USA found significantly lower disturbance rates following the establishment of a voluntary waterfowl avoidance area (VWAA), despite an overall increase in boat traffic.
