2456: Use lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention specifically refers to use of light and sound in combination, typically delivered via a commercially-produced product designed to deter visits by wild mammals. If successful, such an intervention could reduce crop damage and, thus, reduce motivation for carrying out lethal control of herbivores.
See also: Use light/lasers to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict, Use loud noises to deter crop damage (e.g. banger sticks, drums, tins, iron sheets) by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict and Use noise aversive conditioning to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using both lights and sound to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Both studies were in the USA.

Human-wildlife conflict (2 studies): Two replicated paired sites, controlled studies (one also randomized), in the USA, found that frightening devices, emitting lights and sound, did not reduce crop intrusions by white-tailed deer or food consumption by elk and mule deer.
