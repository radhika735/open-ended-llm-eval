326: Clear or open patches in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Forests naturally undergo disturbances, from storms, lightning and even large animals. These disturbances can create a mix of different habitats, with open clearings allowing a greater range of species to survive in a forest. Deliberately creating open patches may, therefore, encourage woodland edge and ‘early-successional’ species.
 

Key Messages:

Of nine studies, seven from the UK and the USA found that early-successional species increased in clearcut areas or opened forests, compared to control areas, areas before management, or other management techniques. One study found that population increases only occurred in clearcuts up to 20 ha in size. Two studies report that mature-forest species declined in cut/opened areas of forest.
A replicated, randomised, controlled study from the USA found no differences in species richness between clearcuts of different sizes, whilst another American study found that a mosaic of cut and uncut areas supported a variety of species. A long-term study from the USA of a landscape with opened patches found that there were no consistent differences between clearcut and controlled areas, although some species were only seen in clearcuts.
