2933: Release captive-bred marine and freshwater mammals to re-establish or boost native populations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding for conservation purposes is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild (often called ‘reintroduction’) to either re-establish a population that has been lost, or to augment an existing population (‘restocking’). This intervention involves the release of captive-bred marine and freshwater mammals into the wild. For studies related to captive-breeding, see Breed marine and freshwater mammals in captivity.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of releasing captive-bred marine and freshwater mammals to re-establish or boost native populations. One study was in the Porto de Pedras estuary (Brazil) and one in water bodies in Florida (USA).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two studies in the Porto de Pedras estuary and water bodies in Florida found that two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention.
