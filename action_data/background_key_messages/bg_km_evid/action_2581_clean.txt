2581: Treat disease in wild mammals
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Treatment of diseases in wild mammals can be problematic. It can be difficult to diagnose causes of illness and the administration of medicines directly to target individuals can be challenging. Except in cases of highly threatened species, treatment of disease in wild mammals is usually only carried out when there are potential economic costs of not treating, such as a risk of transmission to domestic animals or reductions in numbers or health of animals that have sporting value. This intervention includes cases where animals are confined for treatment (and one study on captive animals that trials a delivery mechanism for treatments that might be administered to wild mammals) but in all cases, the aim is to improve the health of wild populations.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of treating disease in the wild. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Condition (2 studies): A replicated study in Germany found that medical treatment of mouflons against foot rot disease healed most infected animals. A before-and-after study in the USA found that management which included vaccination of Yellowstone bison did not reduce prevalence of brucellosis.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Uptake (1 study): A study in the USA found that a molasses-based bait was readily consumed by white-tailed deer, including when it contained a dose of a disease vaccination.
