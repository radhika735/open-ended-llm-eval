267: Add perches to electricity pylons to reduce electrocution
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raptors and other large birds can become electrocuted when they perch on pylons and touch multiple wires with their wings. Adding perches to pylons may therefore reduce mortality by allowing birds to land safely away from the wires.
 

Key Messages:
A single before-and-after study in Spain found that adding perches did not reduce electrocutions of Spanish imperial eagles Aquila adalberti.
