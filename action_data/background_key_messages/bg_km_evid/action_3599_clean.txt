3599: Install exclusion devices on fishing gear: Snakes & lizards
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Aquatic reptiles may become trapped or entangled in fishing nets (e.g. trawl nets, hoop nets, fyke nets) and traps. Exclusion devices, such as grids, mesh, funnels, rings, or rectangular inserts, can be installed in an attempt to reduce the number of non-target animals that are caught.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for:Â Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles or Crocodilians. 
For studies that discuss the effect of using devices that allow reptiles to escape from fishing gear, see Install escape devices on fishing gear, and for studies on the effect of using a combination of exclusion and escape devices see Install exclusion and escape devices on fishing gear.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of installing exclusion devices on fishing gear on snake and lizard populations. This study was in Australia.
