3504: Alter road surfaces
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Due to the way that reptiles regulate their body temperature using external sources, it is possible that sun-warmed roads surfaces may contribute to road-related mortality. Gravel roads are cooler than surrounding natural habitats and may offer an intervention option to prevent reptiles from crossing roads (Shine et al. 2004).
