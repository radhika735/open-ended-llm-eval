1314: Use herbicides to remove invasive plant species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Invasions by non-native species are considered a major threat to biodiversity.  One way of controlling invasive plants is by using herbicides. This action may also affect the abundance of plants other than the targeted species, and as result influence the forest structure and composition.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness.
