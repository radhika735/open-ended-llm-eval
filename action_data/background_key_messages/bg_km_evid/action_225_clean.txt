225: Plant cereals for whole crop silage
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Cereal-based wholecrop silage (CBWCS) is an intervention that involves growing crops, not grass, to turn into silage. This may provide seed resources for grain-eating farmland birds throughout the year.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled trial in the UK found that seed-eating birds used CBWCS fields, especially those planted with barley, more than other crops in both summer and winter. Insect-eating species used other crops and grassland more.
