1308: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Decontamination to prevent further spread
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
C. helmsii is able to rapidly regenerate from small fragments of plant, and is also highly tolerant of drying out (Dawson & Warman 1987). This means it can easily be spread between water bodies, for example on equipment used for fishing or other watersports. Effective methods to decontaminate equipment, such as hot water or bleach, are therefore important in minimising the spread of C. helmsii.
Dawson F. H. & Warman E.A.  (1987) Crassula helmsii (T. Kirk) Cockayne: Is it an aggressive alien aquatic plant in Britain? Biological Conservation, 42, 247-272.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled, replicated container study in the UK found that submerging Crassula helmsii in hot water led to higher mortality than drying out plant fragments or a control.
