584: Translocate nests to avoid disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some birds return year after year to the same nest, making moving them difficult: birds are likely to return to the old site the next year. If nesting sites are threatened by development or are unsuitable for some reason then moving birds could be beneficial. However, it is possible that if the nest can be moved whilst it is in use, the birds will return to its eventual site rather than its original position.
 

Key Messages:

Four small trials from the USA and a replicated study from Chatham Island, New Zealand found some success in relocating nests whilst they were in use.
However, one study from the USA found that only 40% of burrowing owls Athene cunicularia were moved successfully, another found that American kestrels Falco sparverius tolerated movement of their nest, but not repeated disturbance and another found that barn swallow Hirundo rustica may follow their nest as it is slowly moved on a car, but may not stay at the new site.
