293: Dye baits to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most seabirds are visual predators, and so are less likely to take bait if it is difficult to see. Dyeing bait blue so that it is hard to see against the water may therefore reduce bait loss and bycatch rates.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised replicated and controlled study in Hawaii found that dying bait blue significantly reduced the number of attacks from albatross on baits being set.
