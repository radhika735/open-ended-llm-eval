3523: Manually remove reptiles from roads
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many reptiles are killed by vehicles, particularly when crossing roads when moving to and from breeding habitats. In some areas, local volunteers may try to reduce deaths by collecting reptiles and releasing them on the other side of the road.
Ideally evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention would consist of survival rates, counts of animals in the population or numbers killed on the road before and after or at sites with and without human assistance. However, such evidence is rarely available.
For other interventions that involve engaging volunteers to help manage reptiles or their habitats see Education and awareness raising – Engage local communities in conservation activities.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effect on reptile populations of manually removing reptiles from roads. This study was in the USA.

Survival (1 study): One study in the USA reported that when turtles were being removed from a road following installation of a fence and artificial nesting mounds, fewer turtles were killed on the road than in the year before any interventions began.
