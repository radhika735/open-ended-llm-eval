403: Can nest protection increase predation of adults and chicks?
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Nest cages and individual barriers are distinctive and may attract predators if they learn to associate the cages with potential prey. As with the previous section, unless studies specifically mention increased predation, they are discussed in ‘Physically protect nests with individual exclosures/barriers’.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated and controlled studies from North America and Sweden found higher levels of predation on adult birds with nest exclosures, one study from Sweden found that predation was no higher.
A replicated and controlled study from Alaska found that long-tailed jaegers Stercorarius longicaudus learned to associate exclosures with birds, targeting adult western sandpipers Calidris mauri and quickly predating chicks when exclosures were removed.
