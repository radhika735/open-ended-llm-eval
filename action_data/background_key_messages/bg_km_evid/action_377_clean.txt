377: Control mammalian predators on islands for rails
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Rails have been especially badly affected by introduced predators and other human impacts, with an estimated 800 species becoming extinct in the Pacific alone (Steadman 1995). They have diversified on islands across the world, with many species losing the ability to fly, thus rendering them extremely vulnerable to invasive predators.
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:
Two before-and-after studies from Australia and the Galapagos Islands found increases in survival or population density of rails on islands following the removal of feral pigs Sus scrofa.
