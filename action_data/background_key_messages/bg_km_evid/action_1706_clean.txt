Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding mulch to soil alongside planting and seeding may help to increase survival of shrubland plants by increasing the amount of moisture in the soil.

Key Messages:

A replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that using mulch did not increase the number of shrubs, or the height of California sagebrush. A randomized, controlled study in South Africa found that applying mulch and sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings, but not their survival.
