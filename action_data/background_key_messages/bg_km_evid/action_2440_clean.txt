2440: Install metal grids at field entrances to prevent mammals entering to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild herbivores can compete with domestic herbivores for food and can damage crops. Fencing can exclude wild herbivores from fields but entranceways remain vulnerable to incursions, especially were regular vehicle access is required. Metal grids (sometimes known as cattle grids) fitted across field entrances may be used to exclude wild herbivores. If successful, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such species.
Â 
See also Install wildlife exclusion grate/cattle grids for studies where the intention is to exclude herbivore access to roads rather than into fields.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammal incursions of installing metal grids at field entrances to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Both of these studies were in the USA.

Human-wildlife conflict (2 studies): One of two replicated studies (including one controlled study), in the USA, found that deer guards (horizontal, ground-level metal grids) reduced entry into enclosures by white-tailed deer whilst the other found that they did not prevent crossings by mule deer or elk.
