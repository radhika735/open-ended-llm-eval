1646: Use grazing or alter livestock to control grass
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Livestock often preferentially feed on palatable grasses. Increasing the number of livestock or altering the type of livestock therefore may reduce grass cover of problematic species and allow shrubland plant species to increase in cover.

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that grazing to reduce grass cover had mixed effects on cover of common heather and cross-leaved heath.
One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Netherlands found that cover of wavy-hair grass increased and one before-and-after study in Spain found a reduction in grass height.
