819: Plant riparian buffer strips
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Uncultivated strips of vegetation at the edge of waterways are often used to help reduce pollution entering the water within agricultural and forestry systems. These buffer strips therefore help to protect aquatic and semi-aquatic species.
Studies that investigated retaining riparian buffers are discussed in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Logging & wood harvesting – Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest’, ‘Habitat protection – Retain buffer zones around core habitat’ and ‘Threat: Agriculture – Exclude domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing’.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles.
