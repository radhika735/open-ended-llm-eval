3336: Install physical supports for planted non-woody plants: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Planted vegetation could be supported with structures such as stakes or wire mesh. Supports may be used in areas disturbed by wind, waves or human activity to hold vegetation in place whilst it establishes.
Related actions: Use fences or barriers to protected planted areas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of installing physical supports for emergent, non-woody plants planted in freshwater wetlands. The study was in the Netherlands.

Biomass/plant (1 study): One replicated, controlled study at the edge of a freshwater lake in the Netherlands found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on biomass of individual plants after 1–2 years.
Stems/plant (1 study): The same study found that supporting planted bulrushes Scirpus  with wire mesh had no significant effect on number of shoots/plant after 1–2 years.
