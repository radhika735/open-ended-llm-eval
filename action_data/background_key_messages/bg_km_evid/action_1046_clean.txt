1046: American bullfrog control: Direct removal of juveniles
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Direct removal of the early lifecycle stage may offer a tool for localised population reduction when used as part of an integrated pest management strategy for controlling invasive bullfrog populations.  For example, a replicated field based and modelling study from 1999 to 2003 on Southern Vancouver Island, Canada (Govindarajulu et al. 2005) found that culling bullfrog metamorphs in autumn was the most effective method of decreasing population growth rate.

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Belgium found double fyke nets were effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds. 
One before-and-after study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping, when carried out as part of a combination treatment.
