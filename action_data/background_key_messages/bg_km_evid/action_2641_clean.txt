2641: Clear or open patches in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Gaps in forests can be natural features that add diversity to the habitat. They can be created by natural events, such as mature trees falling, and maintained by grazing animals. In absence of natural gaps (such as in a younger forest) artificially creating gaps may mimic the same conditions. This intervention considers some cases where gaps are created primarily as a conservation action and others where gaps are created as part of timber harvesting.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of clearing or opening patches in forests. Two studies were in the USA, one was in Bolivia and one was in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (4 STUDIES)

Abundance (4 studies): Two of four replicated studies (including three controlled studies and a site comparison study), in Bolivia, the USA and Canada, found that creating gaps or open patches within forests did not increase small mammal abundance relative to uncut forest. One study found that it did increase small mammal abundance and one found increased abundance for one of four small mammal species.
