473: Water nesting mounds to increase incubation success in malleefowl
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata and other megapodes build large nesting mounds, filled with vegetation. This vegetation rots and produces heat which then incubates the eggs. This process requires the vegetation to be damp, meaning that eggs may die in dry conditions. Artificially adding water to the mounds may help prevent this.
 

Key Messages:
A small controlled in Australia found that two malleefowl Leipoa ocellata nests were abandoned after they dried out, despite being watered, although unwatered nests were abandoned much earlier.
