488: Provide artificial nesting sites for raptors
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many birds of prey return every year to the same nesting site, adding material so that the nest gets larger and larger. In extreme cases, this can damage the tree or structure that the nest is on, resulting in the nest falling. Providing platforms or other robust structures for birds to build on may, therefore, help to increase reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:

Nine studies from North America and Spain found that raptors used artificial nesting platforms, although one describes low levels of use and another describes use increasing over time.
Two studies from the USA describe increases in populations or population densities of raptors following the installation of artificial nesting platforms.
Three studies describe successful use of platforms, whilst three describe lower productivity or failed nesting attempts, although these studies only describe a single nesting attempt each.
