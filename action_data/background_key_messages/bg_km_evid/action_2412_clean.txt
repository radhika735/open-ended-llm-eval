2412: Change type of livestock
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Domestic herbivores differ in the way that they graze. In particular, some species are more selective than others, and so will concentrate grazing in areas with highly palatable plant species. This may generate different effects on vegetation dynamics than does grazing by more generalist herbivores (Evans et al. 2015). Furthermore, large herbivores, such as cattle, may disturb the ground more through their footprints than is the case for smaller grazers, such as sheep. Such effects may produce a vegetation sward and structure than is more or less suited for wild mammals.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effect of changing type of livestock on mammals. One study was in the UK and one was in the Netherlands.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, paired sites, controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that sheep and cattle grazing increased field vole abundance relative to sheep-only grazing. One replicated, randomized, paired sites study in the Netherlands found that cattle grazing increased vole abundance relative to horse grazing.
