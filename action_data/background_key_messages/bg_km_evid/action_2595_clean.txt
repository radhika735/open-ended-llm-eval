2595: Provide more small artificial breeding sites rather than fewer large sites
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
When providing artificial breeding sites for colonial mammals, there may be a trade-off between providing large sites, which may support larger, more-resilient populations at each site, or a greater number of small sites, which may increase the chance of at least some sites surviving threats such as predation or disease. The size of the overall population may also be influenced if the density of animals occupying these sites differs between different sized sites.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of providing more small artificial breeding sites rather than fewer larger sites. This study was in Spain.
