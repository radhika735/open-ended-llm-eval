833: Regulate water levels
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Drying of amphibian breeding sites before terrestrial life stages have developed can have significant detrimental effects on populations. In some cases it may be possible to maintain water levels until after metamorphosis by using a local water source or by bringing in water from an outside source.
Occasional drying of breeding sites can increase diversity, as it can help control predators, non-native species or more dominant species.
Studies that manipulated water levels to restore wetlands are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Restore wetlands’.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated, site comparison study) in the UK found that habitat management that included maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations. One replicated, controlled study in Brazil found that keeping rice fields flooded after harvest changed amphibian species composition, but not numbers of species or abundance.
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that draining ponds, particularly in the summer, significantly increased abundance and numbers of amphibian species.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that maintaining pond water levels enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs.
