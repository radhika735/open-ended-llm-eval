2598: Install traffic calming structures to reduce speeds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the design speed of a road can be used to reduce vehicle speed rather than reducing the legal speed limit. Traffic calming methods include speed bumps, rumble strips, curb or pavement extensions (to reduce road width) and raised central medians/islands. Such structures get the attention of drivers and encourage them to slow down, which may help to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of installing traffic calming structures to reduce speeds. This study was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A before-and-after study in Australia found that following installation of barriers to create a single lane, rumble strips, reflective wildlife signs, reflective wildlife deterrents, wildlife escape ramps and production of an educational pamphlet, a small population of eastern quoll population re-established in the area.
Survival (1 study): A before-and-after study in Australia found that following installation of barriers to create a single lane, rumble strips, reflective wildlife signs, reflective wildlife deterrents, wildlife escape ramps and production of an educational pamphlet, vehicle collisions with Tasmanian devils, but not eastern quolls decreased.
