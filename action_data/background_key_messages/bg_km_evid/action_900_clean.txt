900: Incorporate leys into crop rotation
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This action involves converting arable land to grass or legume pasture (leys) for at least one growing season. We found evidence for one study examining different extents of grass pasture in leys.
 

Key Messages:
One replicated study from Denmark showed that reducing the extent of grass pasture in leys reduced the undesirable uptake of nitrogen by grasses, therefore requiring lower rates of fertilizer for subsequent crops.
SOIL TYPE COVERED: sandy-loam.
