214: Create skylark plots for bird conservation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis require short vegetation to nest in and skylark plots are small (usually 4–16 m2) undrilled patches within cereal fields that provide this, with little impact on overall yield. They are similar to lapwing plots (see above) but much smaller.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study found an increase in Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis population on a farm after the creation of skylark plots; a replicated, controlled study from the UK found higher densities of skylarks on fields with plots, compared to those without. No other studies investigated population-level effects.
Two UK studies, one replicated and controlled, found that skylark productivity was higher in plots or in fields with plots than in controls. One replicated and controlled study from Switzerland found no differences in productivity between territories that included plots and those that did not.
Two replicated studies (one controlled) from Denmark and Switzerland found that skylark plots were used by skylarks more than expected. A replicated and controlled study from the UK found that seed-eating songbirds did not use skylark plots more than surrounding crops.
