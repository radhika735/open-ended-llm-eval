1964: Maintain microclimate in closed/abandoned mines
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Closing mines and physically obstructing mine entrances can alter the internal microclimate and make conditions unsuitable for roosting bats. Adverse impacts on airflow and water drainage should be avoided. For a similar intervention, see ‘Restore and maintain microclimate in modified caves’. See also ‘Install and maintain cave gates to restrict public access’ for a study in which a stone wall and gate influenced the microclimate of a cave with an effect on hibernating bats.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of maintaining the microclimate in an abandoned mine on bat populations. The study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the USA found that modifying the microclimate of an abandoned mine by closing a man-made entrance resulted in a greater number of bats hibernating within the mine.
