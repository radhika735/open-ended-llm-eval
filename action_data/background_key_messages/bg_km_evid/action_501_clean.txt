501: Provide nesting material for wild birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some habitats nesting sites may be abundant, but material to create or line nests may be lacking. In these situations, conservationists may wish to provide this material.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in the UK found that songbirds used feathers provided at a very low rate and nest construction did not appear to be resource limited.
A replicated, controlled study from Australia found that four species of egrets used supplementary nesting material provided, preferentially taking material from raised platforms over water compared to plots on dry land.
