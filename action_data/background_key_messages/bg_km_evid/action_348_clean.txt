348: Employ grazing in natural grasslands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
This section contains studies describing the effects of grazing on natural grasslands, such as prairies in the USA and Canada. The effects of grazing on semi-natural or artificial grasslands and pastures are discussed in ‘Graze artificial grasslands/pastures’.
 

Key Messages:

Five of 12 studies from the USA and Canada, four replicated, found that some species studied were found at higher densities on grazed than ungrazed sites. Eight studies from the USA, Canada and France, six replicated, found that some or all species studied were found at lower densities on grazed sites compared to ungrazed sites or those under other management, or that there were no differences.
Two controlled studies from the USA and Canada, one replicated, found that duck nesting success was higher on grazed than ungrazed sites. Two studies from the USA found that songbird nesting success was lower on grazed than ungrazed sites. Three replicated and controlled (one randomised) studies from the USA and Canada found that grazing had little or no effect on nesting success in a variety of species.
