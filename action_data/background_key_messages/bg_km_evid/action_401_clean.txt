401: Can nest protection increase nest abandonment?
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Placing individual barriers over nests is likely to disturb incubating parents, and in extreme cases, this may lead to them abandoning the nest. Unless nests are abandoned, studies are unlikely to mention it and so will be discussed in ‘Physically protect nests with individual exclosures/barriers’.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated before-and-after study from the USA found that nest abandonment increased after nest exclosures were installed. Two replicated studies in Sweden and the USA found small levels of abandonment, or non-significant increases in abandonment following nest exclosure installation.
A meta-analysis from the USA found that some designs of nest exclosures were more likely to lead to abandonment than others.
