159: Use repellents on baits for predator control
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If repellents that discourage birds from taking bait but do not affect bait consumption by target species can be identified then the risk of incidental mortality during eradication programmes may be greatly reduced.
Most birds (unlike most mammals) are visual hunters and foragers, meaning that strangely coloured baits may not be taken as readily, and so using them during eradication programmes may reduce incidental mortality.

Key Messages:

A replicated, randomised and controlled experiment in the USA found that methyl anthanilate and aminoacetophenone did not reduce consumption of baits by American kestrels Falco sparverius.
A replicated, randomised and controlled experiment in New Zealand found that treating baits with pulegone or Avexâ„¢ reduced pecking rates in North Island robins Petroica australis longipes.
