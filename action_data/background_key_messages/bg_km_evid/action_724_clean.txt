724: Grow non-crop plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves growing non-crop plants which produce volatile chemicals (quickly evaporating scents or odours) that attract natural enemies, thereby encouraging the enemies to the main crop. Non-crop plants could be grown in field margins or interspersed into the main crop. Lab studies demonstrating an attractive effect of a plant species or variety to a natural enemy are also included.
Here we present evidence from four of six studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Natural enemies: Four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya tested the effects of growing plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Three (including one replicated, randomised, controlled trail) found higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals, and one found that the attractive plant also attracted natural enemies in lab studies. One found no effect on parasitism but the plant used was found not to be attractive to natural enemies in lab studies. Pests: All four studies found a decrease in either pest population or pest damage in plots with plants that produce chemicals that attract natural enemies. Yield: One replicated, randomised, controlled study found an increase in crop yield in plots with plants that produce attractive chemicals.
Crops studied were lettuce, orange, safflower and sorghum.
