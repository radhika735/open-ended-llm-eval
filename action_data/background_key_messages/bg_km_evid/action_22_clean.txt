22: Reduce the intensity of farmland meadow management
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the intensity of grassland management involves reducing or stopping the use of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides and delaying the mowing date until later in the summer.

Key Messages:
Four replicated trials in Europe have compared farmland meadows managed extensively with conventionally farmed meadows or silage fields. Two found enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with a delayed first cut and little agrochemical use. Two found no difference in bee diversity or abundance between conventional meadows and meadows with reduced fertilizer use or cutting intensity.
