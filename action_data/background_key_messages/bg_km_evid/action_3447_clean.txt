3447: Cease or alter maintenance activities on subtidal artificial structures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Definition: ‘Ceasing or altering maintenance activities’ includes actions taken to avoid or reduce the disturbance, damage or removal of native organisms from structures, with the aim of enhancing their biodiversity.
Subtidal rocky habitats experience intermittent disturbance from storms, sedimentation, pollution and other human activities, which lead to fluctuations in biodiversity (e.g. Balata et al. 2007). These pressures are often more pronounced and frequent on artificial structures, especially those built in urban areas with high human activity and poor water quality, and/or in areas of high wave energy (Airoldi & Bulleri 2011; Moschella et al. 2005). Artificial structures are also often subject to disturbance from maintenance activities carried out to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose, safe, and aesthetically acceptable. Maintenance can include repairing or reinforcing points of weakness such as eroded cracks or holes, moving or replacing dislodged components, or cleaning regimes using physical or chemical methods. Such activities can further disturb, damage or remove biodiversity from structure surfaces (Harasti et al. 2010; Mamo et al. 2020), reduce the availability of microhabitats for organisms to shelter in (Moreira et al. 2007), and leave bare space available to opportunistic non-native or other nuisance species (Viola et al. 2017).
Although some maintenance is likely to be essential, there may be opportunities to cease or alter activities that disturb, damage or remove native organisms from subtidal artificial structures, to maintain or enhance their biodiversity. Altering activities could include using lower-impact methods, reducing the frequency or adjusting the timing of maintenance to avoid disturbance, damage, removal or the creation of bare space on surfaces when non-native or problematic species are more likely to occupy it (Airoldi & Bulleri 2011; Viola et al. 2017). It could also include allowing natural weathering of structure surfaces to occur, creating texture and microhabitat spaces (Moreira et al. 2007).
Studies of the effects of real or simulated maintenance activities to illustrate their impact compared with no or altered maintenance, where it is not clear that ceasing/altering maintenance would be a feasible conservation action, are not included but are informative (e.g. Airoldi & Bulleri 2011; Mamo et al. 2020; Viola et al. 2017). Studies that investigate cleaning activities to control or remove non-native or nuisance species are similarly not included where these actions are indiscriminate, simultaneously removing all biodiversity (e.g. Novak et al. 2017).

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of ceasing or altering maintenance activities on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. One study was in an estuary in southeast Australia and one was in an inland bay in eastern USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall community composition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not alter the combined invertebrate and fish community composition on and around structure surfaces.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the combined invertebrate and fish species richness or diversity on and around structure surfaces.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the combined invertebrate and fish abundance on and around structure surfaces.
Algal abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures increased the macroalgal abundance on structure surfaces.
Fish abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia found that reducing the area cleaned on a subtidal artificial structure increased the seahorse abundance on structure surfaces.
Survival (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the survival of transplanted oysters.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that reducing the frequency of cleaning on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the growth of transplanted oysters.
