1953: Use non-lethal measures to prevent bats from accessing fruit in orchards to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Bats may be culled by farmers or injured/killed by entanglement with inappropriately installed nets at fruit orchards. Various non-lethal alternatives have been suggested to prevent bats from accessing fruit in orchards to reduce human-wildlife conflict. These include using fixed nets (that prevent entanglement), netting individual trees or branches, planting decoy crops, picking fruit before peak ripeness and deterring bats with light, noise or unpleasant smells and tastes (see Aziz et al. 2016).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using non-lethal measures to prevent bats from accessing fruit in orchards to reduce human-wildlife conflict. The studies were in Madagascar and Mauritius.

Human-wildlife conflict (2 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in Madagascar and Mauritius found that using an organic deterrent spray, hanging plastic flags in trees, or covering individual tree branches with nylon net bags reduced damage to lychees caused by Madagascan flying foxes or Mauritius fruit bats. One of the studies found that ringing bells in lychee trees deterred most Madagascan flying foxes.
