1882: Amphibians: Allow female mate choice
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Female mate choice has been observed in captivity, with possible factors that are selected including call frequency, territory size or type and body size. By providing multiple males or moving females around enclosures, choice and the probability of compatibility is increased. 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Australia found that frogs only bred after females carrying eggs were introduced to males, sex ratios were manipulated, recorded mating calls were played, and after being moved to an indoor enclosure which allowed temporary flooding and had various types of organic substrates.
One replicated, before-and-after study in Australia found that clutch size of frogs increased when female mate choice was provided, alongside playing recorded mating calls, sexes being separated in the non-breeding periods, and allowing females to increase in weight before breeding.
