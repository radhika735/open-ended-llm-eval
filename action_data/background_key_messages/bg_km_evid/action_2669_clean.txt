2669: Cease or prohibit mobile midwater (pelagic) fishing gears
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Mobile midwater (pelagic) fishing gears are nets deployed in the water column above the seabed, typically used to catch pelagic fish species such as herrings Clupeidae, tunas Thunnus spp. and salmon Salmonidae. They include midwater trawls and semi-mobile gears such as purse seines, ring nets and pelagic drift nets. Mobile pelagic gears are generally considered less damaging to seabed habitats than towed bottom fishing gears as they do not purposefully contact the seabed and thus the impact is reduced. However, they are still capable of catching large numbers of fish of both target and non-target species, and accidental contact with seabed features may still occur. Ceasing or prohibiting fishing with mobile pelagic fishing gears may reduce overall fishing effort and fishing mortality in an area, and subsequently reduce the effects on fish populations.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of ceasing or prohibiting fishing with towed (mobile) midwater fishing gears on marine fish populations. The study was in the Norwegian Sea (Norway).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Condition (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after drift netting was prohibited in an area, the weights of young salmon returning to rivers were higher than before, and weights of older salmon were similar or lower.
Abundance (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the Norwegian Sea found that in the five years after the use of drift nets was prohibited, there were more young salmon returning to rivers than before, and similar numbers of older multi-returning salmon.
