1817: Build artificial bird perches to encourage seed dispersal
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial bird perches may help to restore peatland forests. Perches are placed near to remaining forest patches to encourage birds to fly out, perch and defecate onto degraded land. The seeds transported in this way might belong to peatland plants (especially tropical swamp forest trees) that would otherwise not disperse into degraded land. Consequently, the abundance and diversity of seedlings may increase in areas with perches (Agra et al. 2016).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: directly introduce herb seeds, shrub/tree seeds, or vegetation fragments containing seeds.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of building artificial bird perches. The study was in a tropical peat swamp.
Vegetation cover (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia found that artificial bird perches had no significant effect on seedling abundance.
