616: Artificially incubate and hand-rear songbirds in captivity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Artificial incubation involves removing eggs from incubating parents and using an incubator to hatch them. Techniques can be extremely complex, with precision humidity and temperature control and turning of the eggs to ensure correct development Hand-rearing can be used with chicks from artificially-incubated eggs or with chicks removed from parents after hatching and involves manually feeding chicks until independence. Both techniques can be used to encourage parents to produce more offspring, or when naturally-raised chicks and eggs have low survival.

Key Messages:

Four studies from the USA found high rates of success for artificial incubation and hand-rearing of songbirds.
The one study to compare techniques found that crow chicks fed more food had higher growth rates, but that these rates never matched those of wild birds.
