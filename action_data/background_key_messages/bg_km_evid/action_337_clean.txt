337: Manually control or remove midstorey and ground-level vegetation (including mowing, chaining, cutting etc) in shrubland
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Conservationists may wish to remove woody vegetation from shrublands if they are dominating the habitat and excluding some open-habitat species. Chaining is sometimes used to do this: a large heavy chain is dragged over the ground to clear vegetation. However, shrubs can also provide habitat complexity and additional niches for species.
 

Key Messages:

Of seven studies, one controlled study from the USA, found that overall bird diversity was similar between chained areas, burned areas and controls. A replicated and controlled study from the USA found that overall diversity was lower on mown sites than  controls, but that grassland-specialist species were present on managed sites.
Five studies from the USA and Europe found than some study species were found at greater densities or abundances on sites with mechanical vegetation control than on sites with prescribed burning or  no management, or that abundances increased after management. One study investigated several interventions at once.
One study from the USA found that total bird densities were similar between chained, burned and control sites. A replicated controlled study from the USA found that mown sites had lower bird abundances than control sites. Three studies from the USA found that some species were less abundant on sites with mechanical vegetation removal, compared with burned or control sites, or showed smaller increases after management.
One replicated, controlled study from the USA found no differences between areas cut in winter and those cut in summer.
