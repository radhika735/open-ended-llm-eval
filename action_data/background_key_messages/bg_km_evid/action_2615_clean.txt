2615: Use chemical repellents along roads or railways
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Large number of mammals, especially deer and other ungulate species, are killed in collisions with road vehicles (e.g. Conover et al. 1995) or trains. This could be reduced if the application of repellents could deter animals from accessing roads.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using chemical repellents along roads or railways. Two studies were in Canada and one each was in Germany, Norway and Denmark.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two studies (one before-and-after, one site comparison), in Germany and Norway, found that chemical-based repellents did not reduce collisions between ungulates and road vehicles or trains.

BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (4 studies): Two of four studies (including three replicated, controlled studies), in Germany, Canada, and Denmark, found that chemical repellents, trialled for potential to deter animals from roads, did not deter ungulates. The other two studies found mixed results with repellents temporarily deterring some ungulate species in one study and one of three deterrents deterring caribou in the other.
