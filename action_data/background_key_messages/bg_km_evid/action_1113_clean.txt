1113: Asian clams: Reduce oxygen in the water
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Very low levels of oxygen in the water for a prolonged period may kill Asian clams Corbicula spp. However, even mild reductions in oxygen may offer advantages by increasing the vulnerability of the clams to predation. When attacked, bivalves protect their soft tissues by closing their protective valves. This reduces vulnerability to small predators, but ventilation and oxygen uptake are suspended. In a laboratory study it was found that after a simulated attack, Asian clams under low oxygen conditions reopened their valves sooner than clams under high oxygen conditions, suggesting that low oxygen levels increases vulnerability to predation (Saloom & Duncan 2005).
Saloom M.E. & Duncan R.S. (2005) Low dissolved oxygen levels reduce anti-predation behaviours of the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea. Freshwater Biology, 50, 1233-1238.

Key Messages:

A controlled laboratory study conducted in the USA found that Asian clams were resistant to extreme very low levels of oxygen, irrespective of water temperature or length of immersion in the test conditions.
