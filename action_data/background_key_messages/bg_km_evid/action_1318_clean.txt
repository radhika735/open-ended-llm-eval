1318: Primates: Present food in puzzle feeders
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Puzzle feeders are seen as a form of enrichment to make more natural and more rewarding ways to provide food to captive animals. The aim is to make the puzzle both mentally and physically challenging to increase their activity and foraging time.
 

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in the USA and the UK found that the use of puzzle feeders decreased food sharing, increased foraging behaviour, and the use of tools but also aggression. 
One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that the use of puzzle feeders increased time spent feeding and less time inactive.
