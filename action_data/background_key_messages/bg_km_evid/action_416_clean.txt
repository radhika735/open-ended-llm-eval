416: Use collar-mounted devices to reduce predation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Cat collars can be modified to carry either simple bells or more complex sonic alerts which scare birds before cats can catch them. Another option is a ‘bib’ which hangs in front of the cat’s legs, preventing them from hunting effectively.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated randomised and controlled studies in the UK and Australia found that significantly fewer birds were returned by cats wearing collars with various anti-hunting devices, compared to controls.
A replicated, randomised and controlled study from the UK found no significant differences between different devices.
Both UK studies found that collars were easily lost.
