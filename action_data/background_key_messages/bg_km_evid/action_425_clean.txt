425: Reduce inter-specific competition for nest sites by modifying habitats to exclude competitor species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Because of the potential controversies over control and eradication efforts, it may be more appropriate to attempt to modify habitats so that they suit one species more than the others. Studies specifically designed to favour one competitor are discussed below, whilst more general habitat modifications are discussed in ‘Natural system modifications’.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated controlled study from the USA found no impact of midstorey clearance on the occupation of red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis nesting cavities by southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans.
