733: Use vaccinations
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Atlantic salmon cultured in commercial farms are at an increased risk of contracting and transferring infectious bacterial diseases and other pathogens. Administering vaccinations that target specific infections aims to reduce or eliminate disease contraction which may spread within the salmon farm, from wild salmon to cultured salmon and vice versa.

Key Messages:
 

Two controlled studies from Iceland and Norway found higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups. This was post exposure to the disease-causing bacteria, Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri, respectively.
Two controlled studies inÂ Australia and Canadia reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease, post vaccination.
Two controlled studies in Norway reported similar results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia.
