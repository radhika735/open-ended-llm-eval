491: Provide artificial nesting sites for oilbirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Oilbirds Steatornis capripensis are a unique, nocturnal species in their own family Steatornithidae, related to nightjars, potoos and frogmouths. However, unlike their relatives oilbirds feed entirely on fruit and nest and roost in caves in northern and central South America. It is thought that the availability of nesting and roosting sites in these caves may limit populations, although increasing habitat destruction is also threatening the species (Thomas 1999).
