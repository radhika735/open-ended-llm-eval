196: Offer per clutch payment for farmland birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most agri-environment schemes aim to compensate farmers for the cost of conservation management on their land, irrespective of the outcomes. The Netherlands, however, also has a scheme where farmers are paid directly, based on the number of breeding bird pairs on their land.
 

Key Messages:

One of two replicated and controlled studies from the Netherlands found that farms with per clutch payments held slightly higher breeding densities of waders, but not higher overall numbers than control farms. One study found no population effects over three years. 
A replicated and controlled study found higher hatching success on farms with payment schemes than control farms.
