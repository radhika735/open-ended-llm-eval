98: Make selective use of spring herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:


This intervention aims to reduce herbicide inputs in fields which do not contain undesirable weed species. It involves not applying an autumn herbicide and reducing spring herbicide applications to a single treatment of a selective herbicide. Reducing spring herbicide treatment to a single application may allow a diverse weed community to develop.



Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled, randomized study in the UK found that spring herbicides had some benefits for beneficial weeds and arthropods.
