2828: Use ‘mammal-safe’ nets to capture and release mammals trapped in fishing structures
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may enter fixed fishing structures, such as herring weirs, and become trapped. This intervention involves the use of specially designed nets, e.g. made with buoyant materials and a larger mesh size, to capture and release mammals instead of conventional fishing nets. This may reduce the risk of injury or death during release.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on marine mammals of using ‘mammal-safe’ nets to capture and release mammals trapped in fishing structures. The study was in the Bay of Fundy (Canada).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One controlled study in the Bay of Fundy found that using ‘marine mammal nets’ with a larger mesh size to release harbour porpoises from herring weirs resulted in lower porpoise mortality compared to using conventional herring nets.
