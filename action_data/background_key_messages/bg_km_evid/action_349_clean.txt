349: Employ grazing in artificial grasslands/pastures
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Studies described below include those on water meadows and pastures and non-native grasslands but not those on coastal marshes. Studies that graze water meadows amongst other interventions designed to restore traditional water meadows are described in ‘Restore or create traditional water meadows’.
 

Key Messages:

Of ten studies captured, one replicated, controlled study from the USA found lower species richness in grazed areas than ungrazed. Another replicated, controlled study from the USA found no consistent differences in community composition between grazed and ungrazed areas.
A small study from Canada found an increase in duck populations following the start of grazing amongst other interventions.
Five studies from the UK and USA, four replicated, found higher use of, or higher nesting densities in, grazed areas compared to ungrazed. Seven studies from the UK, Canada and the USA, five replicated, found no differences in use or nesting densities, or lower abundances of birds on grazed, compared with ungrazed areas. One found that several species appeared to be excluded by grazing. 
Three studies from the UK, USA and Canada, two replicated, found that nesting success or productivity was similar, or lower, on grazed sites compared with ungrazed.
