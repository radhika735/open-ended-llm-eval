1601: Parrot’s feather: Biological control using plant pathogens
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Plant pathogens have been used to control invasive aquatic plants by inducing plant mortality (Charudattan 2001). The introduction of pathogens may impact non-target species and therefore in-depth studies investigating possible undesired consequences should be undertaken prior to the application of any plant pathogen. The use of fungal-based herbicides to control parrot’s feather is discussed under ‘Biological control using fungal-based herbicides’ and the use of herbivores for the biocontrol of control parrot’s feather is discussed under ‘Biological control using herbivores’

Key Messages:

One study in South Africa found that parrot’s feather plants survived after being treated with a strain of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris.
