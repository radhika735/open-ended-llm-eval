291: Use bait throwers to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The turbulence created by a boat’s wake can stop bait from sinking quickly, allowing birds more time to become hooked. Bait throwers work by throwing bait clear of the wake, so that it sinks faster. Throwers also allow fishermen to direct lines, for example aiming them to lie under streamer lines (see ‘Use streamer lines to reduce seabird bycatch on longlines’

Key Messages:
A study from Australia found significantly lower seabird bycatch on longlines set with a bait thrower.
