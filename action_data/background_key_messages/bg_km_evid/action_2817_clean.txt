2817: Play predator calls to deter mammals from fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Playing predator calls may deter marine and freshwater mammals from fishing gear. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in gear, as well as human-wildlife conflict resulting from mammal predation on fish catches. Caution is required, as this intervention may cause stress to mammals and could have negative impacts on mammal behaviour and habitat use.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of playing predator calls to deter mammals from fishing gear. The study was in the South Atlantic Ocean (Africa).
