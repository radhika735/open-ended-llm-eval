115: Provide short grass for birds
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife, with short vegetation allowing birds access to the ground for foraging and potentially reducing predation risk. However, high vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats.
See also ‘Raise mowing height on grasslands’.


Key Messages:

A replicated UK study found that common starlings and northern lapwing spent more time foraging on short grass, compared to longer grass, and that starlings captured more prey in short grass.
