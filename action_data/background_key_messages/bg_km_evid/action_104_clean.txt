104: Control invasive non-native plants on farmland (such as Himalayan Balsam, Japanese knotweed)
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves controlling invasive non-native plant species such as giant hogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum, Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera and Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica. Invasive non-native plants may have negative effects on both native plants and animals (Natural England 2011). Techniques to control these species can involve a range of methods including mechanical control such as cutting or cultivation, or herbicide application (Environment Agency 2010).

Key Messages:

Two randomized,      replicated, controlled trials in the Czech Republic found that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants at peak flowering      time dramatically reduced seed production in giant hogweed.
