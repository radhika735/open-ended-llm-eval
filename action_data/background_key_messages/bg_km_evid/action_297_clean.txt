Seabirds may be predated by large fish such as sharks and so may show avoid the smell of them. Dripping shark liver oil whilst setting lines may, therefore, reduce bycatch.
 

Key Messages:

A third replicated and controlled trial in found no differences in the number of seabirds following a bait-laying boat with shark liver oil.
