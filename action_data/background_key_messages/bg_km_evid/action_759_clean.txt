759: Create artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Amphibians need damp sheltered places for overwintering or aestivating during hot arid summers. Overwintering or aestivating sites, or ‘hibernacula’, can be created for amphibians where natural sites are limited or where these habitats have been lost, for example at newly restored sites or in gardens.
Other studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in ‘Create refuges’ and ‘Biological resource use - Leave coarse woody debris in forests’.
 
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that providing artificial hibernacula, along with other terrestrial habitat management, maintained populations of great crested newts.
One replicated study in the UK found that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts, but not great crested newts. One replicated study in the UK found four amphibian species close to hibernacula at two of three sites.
