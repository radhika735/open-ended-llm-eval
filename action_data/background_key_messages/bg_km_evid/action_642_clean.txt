Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

This intervention involves sowing rare or declining arable plant species, such as common corncockle Agrostemma githago, to re-establish populations in the farmed landscape.

 

Key Messages:

Two studies from the UK (both replicated, controlled and randomized) found that the establishment of rare or declining arable weeds depended upon cover crop, cultivation, timing of cut and year or a combination of cultivation in autumn and herbicide treatment.
