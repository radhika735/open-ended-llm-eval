1887: Amphibians: Supplement diets with carotenoids (including for colouration)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In captivity, amphibian diets are often dramatically simplified, and prey species are often those that can be bred cheaply and efficiently in captivity. By providing amphibians with prey that have been in reared on a substrate dusted with carotenoids, which may not naturally be present in the prey, nutritional deficiencies could be avoided. Carotenoids are found in the yolk of eggs and are thought to provide a range of benefits, including improving neonate health.

Key Messages:

One study in the USAÂ found that adding carotenoids to fruit flies fed to frogs reduced the number of clutches, but increased the number of tadpoles and successful metamorphs.
