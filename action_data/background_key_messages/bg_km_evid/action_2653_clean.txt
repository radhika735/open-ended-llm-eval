2653: Gather coarse woody debris into piles after felling
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Coarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches that are left during tree harvesting. Gathering coarse woody debris into piles, either at a single point or as a line of debris across the forest floor, can increase structural diversity on a forest scale relative to evenly spreading the material.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of gathering coarse woody debris into piles after felling. Both studies were in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in Canada found higher mammal species richness where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two randomized, replicated, controlled studies in Canada found higher counts of San Bernardino long-tailed voles where coarse woody debris was gathered into piles. The other study found higher small mammal abundance at one of three plots where debris was gathered into piles.
