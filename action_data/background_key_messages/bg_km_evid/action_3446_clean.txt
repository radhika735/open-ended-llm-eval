3446: Create natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Definition: ‘Natural rocky reef topography’ refers to the full fingerprint of substrate topography found in natural rocky habitats.
Topography influences the settlement and survival of marine organisms on subtidal rocky substrates. Variation in topography generates variation in the physical environment and plays an important role in sustaining biodiversity and ecological functioning (Levin 1974). On rocky reefs, many habitat features that offer refuge from physical stressors and predation, such as bumps, crevices and holes, are generated as a function of substrate topography and geomorphology. The full fingerprint of natural rocky reef topography encompasses a variety of habitat features of different scales interacting within a mosaic.
Marine artificial structures often have much lower topographic variability than natural rocky reefs, which is thought to be a key reason for their reduced biodiversity (Wilhelmsson & Malm 2008). Natural rocky reef topography can be created on subtidal artificial structures by moulding or casting material during construction or retrospectively (see Evans et al. 2021).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures. The study was on an open coastline in Italy.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Algal abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy found that creating natural rocky reef topography on subtidal artificial structures did not increase the abundance of juvenile canopy macroalgae that settled onto structure surfaces, regardless of the topography depth.
