3921: Increase crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural landscapes are often homogenous, with the same crops being grown across a large area. Increasing the diversity of crops within a single farm, or across a farmed landscape, may improve the habitat suitability for butterflies and moths by increasing the availability of resources, or making that availability more consistent over time. For example, differences in flowering time or harvest time may increase the permability of the landscape for butterflies and moths, or mean that nectar resources are available for longer across the summer than if only a single crop type was present.
For studies on increasing diversity within a field, see “Plant more than one crop per field (intercropping)”.

Key Messages:
     

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of increasing crop diversity across a farm or farmed landscape. Both studies were in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Switzerland found that farms and landscapes with a greater number of habitats or crop types had a similar species richness of butterflies to farms and landscapes with fewer different habitats or crop types.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a greater number of habitats had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with fewer different habitats.
