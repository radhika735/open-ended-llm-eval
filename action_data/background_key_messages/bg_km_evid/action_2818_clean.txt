2818: Use an electric current to deter mammals from fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Low-voltage electric currents may be used to deter marine and freshwater mammals from fishing gear. This may reduce the risk of mammals becoming entangled or captured in gear, as well as human-wildlife conflict resulting from mammal predation on fish catches. However, caution is required to ensure that mammals that have contact with the gear are not injured. There may also be safety risks for fishers operating electrified gear.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using an electric current to deter mammals from fishing gear. The study was in the Fraser River (Canada).
