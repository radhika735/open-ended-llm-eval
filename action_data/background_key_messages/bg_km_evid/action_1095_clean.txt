1095: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Add chemicals to the water
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Adding toxic chemical to the water offers the potential for localised control of invasive gammarid shrimps. Chemical ‘dips’ for fishing and sampling gear can also be an effective biosecurity method for preventing the transport of gammarids between water bodies.  Most chemicals will have an impact on non-target organisms, and so their use must be carefully considered before being dosed. In many instances, the use of chemicals may be subject to local or national approval by regulatory authorities.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled laboratory study in the UK found that iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite added to freshwater killed invasive killer shrimp, but were considered impractical for field application. Methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp when added to freshwater.
