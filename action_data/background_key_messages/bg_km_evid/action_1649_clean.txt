1649: Add mulch to control grass
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mulch is usually an organic material such as leaves, grass cuttings, or wood chips that is applied to the top layer of soils. Using mulch directly on unwanted plants can reduce the amount of light they receive and therefore may reduce their abundance.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled study in the USAÂ found that areas where mulch was used to control grass cover had a similar number of shrub seedlings to areas where mulch was not applied. The same study found that mulch application did not reduce grass cover.
