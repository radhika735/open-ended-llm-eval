479: Provide artificial nesting sites for grebes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Like divers/loons, grebes are highly specialised for swimming and diving and are therefore vulnerable on land. Providing artificial islands or floating rafts may increase both the number of birds nesting at a site, and their reproductive success.
 

Key Messages:
A single study from the UK found that grebes used nesting rafts in some areas of the UK but not others, and that the characteristics of used rafts differed geographically.
