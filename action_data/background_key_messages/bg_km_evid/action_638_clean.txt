638: Use ‘flying training’ before release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Birds in captivity will rarely fly as far or as often as those in the wild, potentially leading to weaker flight muscles.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the Dominican Republic found that captive-reared Hispaniolan parrots Amazona ventralis had higher initial survival if they were given pre-release predator training, although this difference was not present a year after release.
