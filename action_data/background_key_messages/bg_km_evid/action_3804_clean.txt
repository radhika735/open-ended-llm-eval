3804: Limit the number of fishing days
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Overfishing leads to volumes of fish being caught that are unsustainable, both ecologically and economically, as well as to damage of fish habitats. Restriction of fishing capacity or effort may therefore help to reduce the effects of overfishing. One way to achieve this may be to limit the duration of fishing by capping the number of days that may be spent at sea. However, other measures may also be needed (by limiting the number of licenced vessels, for example) to prevent the same amount of fish being caught in a shorter period by an increased number of vessels, as was reported for Pacific halibut in the late 1980s (Szymkowiak et al. 2020).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of limiting the number of fishing days on marine fish populations. The study was in the Mediterranean Sea (Italy).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One before-and-after study in the Mediterranean Sea reported that in the 10 years following a decrease in overall number of days fished by a bottom trawl fleet, there was a higher biomass of thornback and brown rays.
