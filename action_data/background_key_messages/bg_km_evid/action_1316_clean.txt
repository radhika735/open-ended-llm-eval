1316: Primates: Hide food in containers (including boxes and bags)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves using boxes or bags to hide daily meals given to primates. This would normally be put in bowls or scattered within an enclosure, but instead it is put within a box or bag hidden within browse, with the aim of increasing individual foraging behaviours. 
 

Key Messages:


Two before-and-after studies in the USA and Ireland found that the addition of browse to food in boxes, baskets or tubes increased activity levels and foraging behaviours in lemurs and gibbons.
