358: Plough habitats 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Ploughing can be used to reduce the dominance of some species, such as Spartina spp. on wetlands, or heathers, on heathland.
 

Key Messages:

One of four studies (of two experiments), from the USA, found that bird densities were higher on ploughed wetland areas, compared to unploughed areas.
Three studies of a site comparison study from the UK found that few whimbrels nested on ploughed and re-seeded areas of heathland, but these areas were used for foraging in early spring. There were no differences in chick survival between birds that used ploughed and re-seeded heathland and those that did not.
