3537: Modify vessels to reduce or prevent injuries to reptiles from collisions
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Many sorts of propeller guards or design changes have been suggested to prevent human injuries, ranging from polypropylene to stainless-steel cages or baffles on outboard motors and these may also help prevent or limit injuries to aquatic reptiles.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of modifying vessels to reduce or prevent injuries to reptiles from collisions. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One controlled study found that using a horizontal-fin propeller guard or a cage propeller guard did not reduce catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells compared to using no guard, but that the types of injuries sustained were different. One controlled study found that using a jet drive outboard motor reduced catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells compared to using a standard outboard motor.
