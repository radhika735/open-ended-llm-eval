432: Remove problematic vegetation 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
We captured four studies describing the effects of species-specific control programmes for plant species. Studies describing more general interventions, such as thinning forests or cutting grasslands are described in ‘Natural system modifications’.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from Japan found higher numbers of long-billed plovers Charadrius placidus after the removal of invasive black locust Robinia pseudoacacia.
A study from Australia found lower mortality of Gould’s petrels Pterodroma leucoptera leucoptera following the removal of most of an island’s (native) bird-lime tree Pisonia umbellifera population, whilst a study from New Zealand found that Chatham Island oystercatchers Haematopus chathamensis could nest in preferable areas following invasive marram grass Ammophila arenaria control.
A site comparison from the USA found lower densities of several birds in areas with (native) velvet mesquite Prosopis juliflora control.
