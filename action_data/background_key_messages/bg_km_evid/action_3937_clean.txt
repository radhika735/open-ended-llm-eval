3937: Replace non-native species of tree/shrub with native species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The conversion of natural habitat to other land uses often leads to the replacement of native vegetation with non-native species. Native trees and shrubs often support a greater abundance and species richness of caterpillars than non-native trees (Clem & Held 2018). Therefore, replacing non-native species with native ones may improve native butterfly and moth populations.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replacing non-native species of tree/shrub with native species. This study was in Panama.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Panama found that established plantations of native trees had a similar species richness of butterflies to plantations of exotic trees, but a greater species richness than old growth forest.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Panama found that established plantations of native trees had a similar abundance of butterflies to plantations of exotic trees, but a higher abundance than old growth forest.
