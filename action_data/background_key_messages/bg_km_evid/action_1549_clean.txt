1549: Preventative vaccination of habituated or wild primates 
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Vaccinations for primates exist for several diseases that may be transmitted to primates by humans, including e.g. measles, poliomyelitis, mumps, and rabies. This intervention aims at preventing the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases from e.g. researchers or tourists to primates.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Puerto Rico found that annual mortality of rhesus macaques decreased after a preventive tetanus vaccine campaign, alongside other interventions.
Two before-and-after studies in the Republic of Congo found that 70% of reintroduced chimpanzees vaccinated against poliomyelitis and tetanus, alongside other interventions, survived over 3.5-5 years after release.
One before-and-after study in the Republic of Congo and Gabon found that more than 80% of the reintroduced gorillas that received preventive vaccination, alongside other interventions, survived over a 10 year period.
