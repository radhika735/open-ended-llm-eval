3431: Use erosion blanket after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many degraded grasslands suffer from erosion due to lack of vegetation. One method of reducing this is by using erosion blankets – biodegradable materials made of natural or synthetic fibres. Combining this with sowing or planting may aid the establishment of grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding an erosion blanket after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot without an erosion blanket). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Key Messages:

Three studies examined the effects of using erosion blankets after seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. Two studies were in the USA and one study was in Spain.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (3 studies): Two of three replicated, controlled studies (two of which were paired and two randomized) in the USA and Spain found that using an erosion blanket after seeding and planting did not alter vegetation cover. The other study found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant density.
