2643: Use thinning of forest instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. By thinning, rather than felling a whole forest, larger areas would need to be managed in order to achieve the same timber harvest though some degree of forest cover can be retained over that area. Thinning forest may benefit some species that prefer an open forest structure whilst not having detrimental effects on forest mammals that clearcutting would be likely to have.
See also Thin trees within forest for where thinning is an intervention in woodland that would otherwise be left without removing trees.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of using thinning of forest instead of clearcutting. This study was in the USA.
