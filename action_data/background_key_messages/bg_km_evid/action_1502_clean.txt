1502: Implement a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The deliberate and long-term provision of food to wildlife by people, e.g. tourists, or for attracting tourists, can have a variety of negative impacts. For example, it can alter natural behavioural patterns and wildlife population levels, has resulted in the dependency of animals on the human provided food and their habituation to human contact, has increased intra and inter-species aggression, and has various health implications arising from artificial food sources causing injury and disease (Orams 2002). This intervention involves enforcing a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy to prohibit the provision of food to primates.
The use of signage to warn people not to feed primates is discussed under ‘Put up signs to warn people about not feeding primates’. The use of garbage bins inaccessible to primates is discussed under ‘Install ‘primate-proof’ garbage bins’. Prohibiting people from consuming food in natural primate habitat is discussed under ‘Do not allow people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them’.

Key Messages:

One controlled, before-and-after study in Japan found that several previously increasing Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning.
