959: Create artificial water sources
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Artificial water sources may be created to provide foraging and drinking resources for bats in arid areas, or in areas where natural wetlands have been lost.
For an intervention that relates to managing livestock water troughs for bats, see ‘Manage livestock water troughs as a drinking resource for bats’. For an intervention that involves using small dams to create water sources, see ‘Create or maintain small dams to provide foraging and drinking habitat for bats’.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial water sources for bats on bat populations. One study was in each of the USA, Germany, South Africa, Israel and Mexico.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds and in grassland/crops, trees, vineyards or orchards.

POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (5 studies): Five replicated studies (including four site comparisons and one paired sites study) in Israel, the USA, Germany, South Africa and Mexico found that bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs and waste water treatment pools, heliponds and drainage ditches, retention ponds and farm/cattle ponds compared to over natural wetlands, nearby vineyards, surrounding forest or grassland/crops, trees and orchards.
