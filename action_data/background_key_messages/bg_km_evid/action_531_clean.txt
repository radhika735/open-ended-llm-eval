Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies from the USA and Greece found that there were population increases in local populations of two vultures (one New World, one Old World) following the provision of food in the area. A study from Israel found that a small, regularly supplied feeding station could provide sufficient food for breeding Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus.
A before-and-after study from Italy found that a small population of Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus declined following the provision of food at a feeding station, and only a single vulture was seen at the feeding station.
