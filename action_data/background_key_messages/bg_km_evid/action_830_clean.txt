830: Remove or control viperine snakes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Introduced species can have significant effects on native species, particularly on oceanic islands. For example, the viperine snake Natrix maura is an invasive species on Mallorca and as one of the main predators of the threatened midwife toad Alytes muletensis, contributed towards its decline (Guicking et al. 2006).

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Mallorca found that numbers of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae increased after intensive, but not less intensive, removal of viperine snakes.
