238: Mark fences to reduce bird collision mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fences erected around young plantations (to exclude deer and other browsers) or to delineate property can be hard to see and low-flying birds such as grouse can be killed by flying into them. See ‘Mark power lines to reduce incidental mortality’ for similar interventions designed to reduce collision mortality with power lines.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that fewer birds collided with deer fence marked with orange netting than with unmarked sections.
