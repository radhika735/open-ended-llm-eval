2576: Create or maintain corridors between habitat patches
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Corridors are areas of natural habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones; Rouget et al. 2006). They may enable animals to disperse and migrate between intact habitat patches, which may increase their chances of survival. They may be particularly important in landscapes where there is relatively little remaining natural habitat.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of creating or maintaining corridors between habitat patches. One study was in each of Canada, the USA, Norway and the Czech Republic.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (4 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): Four studies (three replicated) in Canada, the USA, Norway and the Czech Republic found that corridors between habitat patches were used by small mammals. Additionally, North American deermice moved further through corridors with increased corridor width and connectivity and root voles moved further in corridors of intermediate width.
