2326: Keep cats indoors or in outside runs to reduce predation of wild mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Domestic cats Felis catus can be major predators on wild mammals. For example, one study estimated that domestic cats in the UK brought home 52–63 million mammals over a five-month period (Wood et al. 2003). Keeping them indoors, or in enclosed outdoor runs, may substantially reduce their impact on wild mammals.
