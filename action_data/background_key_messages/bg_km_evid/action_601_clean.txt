601: Use artificial insemination in captive breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Artificial insemination involves artificially introducing sperm into a female’s reproductive tract to fertilise her eggs. It may have advantages over natural insemination through mating if, for example, captive birds will not form pair bonds, or if males in some pairs are infertile. The ability to transport frozen sperm between geographically isolated populations can also substantially increase the genetic diversity of species. However, the methods used may be very species-specific and research may be needed before it can be adopted for any one species.
 

Key Messages:

A review of artificial insemination argued that it could be a useful tool to conservationists, but that there were challenges to its use. Deep and repeated inseminations increased fertility.
Two trials from the USA found that artificial insemination of raptors achieved approximately 50% fertility or 0%.
A review of a houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii captive breeding programme in Saudi Arabia found that artificial insemination increased fertility, whilst another review found that the highest fertility levels were achieved with inseminations of at least 10 million spermatozoa every 4–5 days.
