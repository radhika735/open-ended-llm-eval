276: Mark eggs to reduce their appeal to egg collectors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Egg collecting involves removing eggs from nests, blowing them to remove the contents and presenting the eggs in a collection. This practice can be extremely damaging for some slow-reproducing species (Ewins 1997) and is made more so by the greater value of, and demand for, rarer species’ eggs. This has led to the prohibition of egg collecting in many countries, but the practice still continues.
Marking eggs in a non-damaging way may reduce the desirability of eggs because collectors are interested in eggs for their aesthetic appeal.

Key Messages:
A single before-and-after study found that marking eggs greatly increased the number of chicks fledging from six raptor nests in Australia in 1979 and 1980.
