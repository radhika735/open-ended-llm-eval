732: Use of probiotics and immunostimulants
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Atlantic salmon cultured in commercial farms are at an increased risk of contracting and transferring infectious bacterial diseases and other pathogens. Immunostimulants and probiotics are drugs administered with the aim of improving immune response and gut health, in turn improving survival rates and condition of the fish.

Key Messages:
 

One replicated study in Scotland found increased survival in salmon fed a probiotic before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over a 28 day period compared with controls.
A replicated, controlled study in Norway found the number of salmon infected with lice was reduced by 28% when fed a diet composed of fish meal and 28% plant-based protein. Adding beta-glucans to the diet decreased lice infection levels by a further 28% compared with controls.
The same study found the addition of mannan oligosaccharides improved gut function by preventing the development of soybean-induced enteritis compared with controls.
