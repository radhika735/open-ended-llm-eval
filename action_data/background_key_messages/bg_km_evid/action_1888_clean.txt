1888: Amphibians: Increase caloric intake of females in preparation for breeding
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In the wild, females are thought to consume large amounts of prey prior to the breeding season and during seasonal increases of prey availability. This may act as a breeding cue and help the females meet the increased energy demands of the breeding season and egg laying. 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in AustraliaÂ found that clutch size of frogs increased when females increased in weight before breeding, as well as having mate choice, recorded mating calls, and sexes being separated in the non-breeding periods.
