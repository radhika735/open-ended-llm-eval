1117: Asian clams: Use gas-impermeable barriers
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Gas-impermeable barriers can be placed on the river or lake bed as a possible management tool for Asian clams Corbicula spp.. As organisms beneath die, oxygen levels fall and this can result in clam death.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled study in North America found that placing gas-impermeable barriers across the bottom of the lake (several small fabric covers or one large cover) significantly reduced the abundance of Asian clams.
