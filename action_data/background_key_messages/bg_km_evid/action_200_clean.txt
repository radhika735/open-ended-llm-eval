200: Reduce conflict by deterring birds from taking crops using repellents
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some parts of the world, the persecution of birds that take crops can be a serious threat to the survival of populations. Methods to reduce the damage done by birds can therefore be important in reducing the pressure on populations.

Key Messages:
A replicated, randomised and controlled ex situ study in the USA found that dickcissels Spiza americana consumed less rice if it was treated with two repellents, compared to controls. Two other repellents did not reduce consumption as effectively.
