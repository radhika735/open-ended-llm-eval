555: Provide supplementary food through the establishment of food populations 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Supplementary feeding can be an intensive and potentially expensive intervention. However, it may be possible to achieve the same results by planting crops or establishing prey populations.
 

Key Messages:

One pre-1950 study in the USA found that waterfowl fed on specially-planted rye grass.
Three studies from North America and Sweden found that attempts to support populations by establishing prey did not succeed. Whooping cranes Grus americana in the USA preferentially fed on scattered grains, over planted crops; attempts in Sweden to boost macroinvertebrate numbers were not successful and great horned owls Bubo virginianus in Canada did not respond to induced increases in prey populations.
