762: Add salt to ponds to reduce chytridiomycosis
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been found to survive in lake water for seven weeks after introduction (Johnson & Speare 2003). Treating the aquatic environment may help to reduce the effect of the disease on amphibians. Salt is often used for fungal diseases in aquaculture and for veterinary treatments of fish and amphibians (Wright & Whitaker 2001; Mifsud & Rowland 2008) and has been found to kill the chytrid fungus (Johnson et al. 2003).

Key Messages:

One study in Australia found that following addition of salt to a pond containing the chytrid fungus, a population of green and golden bell frogs remained free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months.
