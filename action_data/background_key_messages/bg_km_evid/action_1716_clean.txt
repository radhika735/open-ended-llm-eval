1716: Add root associated bacteria/fungi to introduced plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many plants have symbiotic relationships with bacteria and fungi associated with their roots. These fungi can help to reduce the effects of plant pathogens as well helping to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thereby potentially increasing plant survival and growth.

Key Messages:

Two controlled studies (one of which was randomized) in Spain found that adding rhizobacteria to soil increased the biomass of shrubs. One of these studies also found an increase in shrub height.
