385: Control predators not on islands for seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Seabirds frequently nest on the ground, where they are vulnerable to predation by both mammals and other birds. In addition, they are often poor walkers, as they are specialised for flying and swimming, and are poor at evading predators.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from New Zealand found an increase in a tern population following intensive trapping of invasive mammals.
A before-and-after study from Canada found increases in tern fledging success following gull control.
