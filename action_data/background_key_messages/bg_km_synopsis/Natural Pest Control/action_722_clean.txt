722: Grow plants that compete with damaging weeds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves planting species that out-compete damaging weeds, suppressing them by reducing their ground cover, growth or reproduction rate, or by increasing their mortality. The intervention is generally applied to pastureland or uncropped areas such as field margins and buffer strips. Plants grown to suppress weeds on large parts of arable land are not included here but are relevant to cover cropping actions, e.g. ‘Grow cover crops when the field is empty’, ‘Grow cover crops beneath the main crop (living mulches) or between crop rows’, ‘Grow crops in strips within a cover crop’ and ‘Incorporate leys into crop rotation’ (actions for inclusion in a future synopsis).
Here we present evidence from nine of 13 studies testing this intervention.

Key Messages:
Weed weight and cover: Nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA tested the effects of planting species to compete with weeds. All (including four replicated, randomised, controlled trials) found reduced weed plant weight or ground cover, although two found this only in some years or conditions. Weed reproduction and survival: Five studies (including three replicated, randomised, controlled trials) also found that competition reduced weed reproduction, survival or both. One of these found an effect only in one year only.
Crops studied were clovers, fescues, ryegrass, other grasses and turnip.
