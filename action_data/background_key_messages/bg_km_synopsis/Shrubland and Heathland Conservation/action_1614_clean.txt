1614: Reduce the frequency of prescribed burning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed burning is often used in the context of game management in the UK to create a mosaic of differently aged heathland patches. These patches provide areas of shorter, succulent heather Calluna spp. on which red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica can feed and taller, denser areas which can be used as cover (Harris et al, 2011).
