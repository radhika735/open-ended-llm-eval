1670: Burn shrublands to reduce impacts of pollutants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Pollutants such as nitrogen can accumulate in the soils and vegetation of shrublands. Burning of vegetation may help to reduce nitrogen pools and aid recovery of plant species supressed by pollution.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that prescribed burning to reduce the impact of nitrogen deposition did not alter the shoot length of common heather or the number of purple moor grass seedlings compared to mowing.
A controlled study in the UK found that burning to reduce the concentration of pollutants in a heathland affected by nitrogen pollution did not alter the cover or shoot length of heather relative to areas that were mowed.
