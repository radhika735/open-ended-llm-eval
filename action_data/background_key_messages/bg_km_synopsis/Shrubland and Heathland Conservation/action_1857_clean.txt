1857: Add topsoil (alongside planting/seeding)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Adding topsoil from shrublands to degraded shrubland sites may help to increase the number of seeds in the soil, thereby increasing the probability of shrubland plants becoming established. The addition of topsoil may also help to increase soil fertility or reduce the effects of processes that dramatically alter soil structure, such as mining or quarrying. Combined with planting or seeding addition of topsoil may help to increase germination and survival of shrubland plants.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, paired, controlled study in the USAÂ found that addition of topsoil alongside sowing of seed increased the biomass of grasses but reduced the biomass of forbs in comparison to addition of topsoil alone.
