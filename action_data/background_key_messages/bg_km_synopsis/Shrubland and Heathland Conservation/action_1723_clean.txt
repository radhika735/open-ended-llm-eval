1723: Use prescribed burning to control grass
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the use of prescribed fire to control problematic grass species in shrublands. Fire may damage or kill grasses therefore reducing competition between with other shrubland vegetation. This may allow shrubland plants to increase in abundance.

Key Messages:

One replicated controlled, paired, before-and-after study in the UK found that prescribed burning to reduce the cover of purple moor grass, did not reduce its cover but did reduce the cover of common heather.
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that prescribed burning initially reduced vegetation height, but this recovered over time.
