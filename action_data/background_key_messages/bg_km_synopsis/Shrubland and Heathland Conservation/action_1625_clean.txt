1625: Reinstate the use of traditional burning practices
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Traditional burning practices in shrublands are used to create a mosaic of differently aged shrub vegetation and increase habitat openness, as well as to limit succession (Bartolomé et al. 2005, Fernandes et al. 2013, Moreira et al. 2011).

Key Messages:

One before and after study in the UK found that prescribed burning initially decreased the cover of most plant species, but that their cover subsequently increased. A systematic review of five studies from the UK found that prescribed burning did not alter species diversity.
A replicated, controlled study in the UK found that regeneration of heather was similar in cut and burned areas. A systematic review of five studies, from Europe found that prescribed burning did not alter grass cover relative to heather cover.
