1208: Shorten livestock grazing period or control grazing season in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Reducing livestock grazing can be done by reducing the number of animals per area unit or by shortening the grazing period during the year. These two methods may vary in their effects on tree regeneration and forest biodiversity, for example if the livestock is removed in critical seasons of seed production and germination.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that shortening the livestock grazing period increased the abundance and size of regenerating oak trees.
One paired-sites study in Australia found no effect of shortening the livestock grazing period on native plant species richness. 
One replicated study in the UK found that the number of tree seedlings was higher following summer compared to winter grazing.
