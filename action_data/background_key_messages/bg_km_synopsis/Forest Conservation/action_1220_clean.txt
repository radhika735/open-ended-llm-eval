1220: Use prescribed fire: effects on young trees
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed fires are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging 'wildfires'. They may also be used for maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional ‘wildfires’ that have been suppressed through management. Prescribed fires may remove large amounts of woody material from the forest understory and increase the amount of grasses and other herbaceous vegetation.
 

Key Messages:

Five of 15 studies (including four replicated, randomized, controlled studies) from Canada, France and the USA found that prescribed fire increased the density and biomass of young trees. Two studies found that fire decreased new tree density. Eight found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species, location and fire frequency.
Two of the above studies found mixed effects of prescribed fire on species diversity of young trees depending on the location.
Two replicated, controlled studies from the USA found mixed effects of prescribed fire on the survival of young trees.
