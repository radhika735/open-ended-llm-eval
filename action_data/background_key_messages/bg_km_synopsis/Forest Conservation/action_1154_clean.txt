1154: Water seedlings
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Watering seedlings can relieve drought stress in young trees and may therefore enhance their survival and growth. However, it may also enhance growth of undesired competing plants.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Spain found that watering tree seedlings increased survival during a dry summer but only increased the survival of some species during a wet summer, depending on the habitat. Watering increased or had no effect on seedling emergence depending on habitat and water availability.
