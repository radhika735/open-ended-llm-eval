1217: Use prescribed fire: effects on mature trees
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Prescribed fires are undertaken to reduce the amount of combustible fuel in an attempt to reduce the risk of more extensive, potentially more damaging 'wildfires'. They may also be used for maintenance or restoration of habitats historically subject to occasional ‘wildfires’ that have been suppressed through management. Prescribed fires may remove large amounts of woody material from the forest understory and increase the amount of grasses and other herbaceous vegetation.
 

Key Messages:

Four of eight studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled studies) from the USA found that prescribed fire decreased  tree cover, density and diversity. One study found it increased tree cover and three found no effect or mixed effects of prescribed fire on cover and density of trees.
Seven studies from the USA (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) found that prescribed fire increased tree mortality.
One of three studies from the USA (including one replicated, controlled study) found that prescribed fire increased tree size while two found no effect of prescribed fire on tree size.
