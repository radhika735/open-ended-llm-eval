1252: Use soil disturbance to enhance germination (excluding scarification or ploughing)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Soil disturbance treatments are often used to improve degraded soils, mainly before restoration planting. These actions may have mixed effects on different plant groups and may have a significant effect on biodiversity and forest structure.
Studies on the effects of mechanically scratching the soil are discussed in ‘Use soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination’.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies from Canada and Finland found that disturbance of the forest floor decreased understory vegetation cover.
