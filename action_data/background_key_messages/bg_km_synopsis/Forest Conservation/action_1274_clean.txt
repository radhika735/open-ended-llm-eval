1274: Use vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance to the soil
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Soil disturbance is often used to improve degraded soils, mainly before restoration planting. In many cases it is applied after clear cutting the existing vegetation. This sequence of actions has mixed effects on different plant groups and may have a significant effect on biodiversity and structure of forests.
Other studies on the effects of soil disturbance are discussed in ‘Use soil scarification or ploughing to enhance germination’ and in ‘Use soil disturbance to enhance germination (excluding scarification or ploughing)’.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies (including one replicated, randomized, controlled study) in Portugal and France found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the cover and diversity of understory plants. One of the studies found it also decreased understory shrub cover.
One replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that vegetation removal together with mechanical disturbance of the soil increased the density of young trees.
