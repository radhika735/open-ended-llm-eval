Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:
Plants (9 studies)

Abundance (7 studies): 4 studies (2 replicated, randomized, and controlled) in  wetlands, riparian zones, and wet habitat features in the USA found higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups (or lower cover of non-native species), in areas with cattle, sheep or goats excluded, compared to grazed areas, in some or all comparisons. One replicated, randomized and controlled study from the USA found lower cover of native plants, in areas with grazers excluded, compared to grazed areas. Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found no difference in the cover or density of native plants between ungrazed and grazed areas.
Diversity (3 studies): One replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands in the USA found more species, or fewer non-native species, in areas with cattle excluded, compared to grazed areas. One replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands and grasslands in the USA found fewer species of native plants in areas with cattle excluded, compared to grazed areas. ne replicated, randomized, and controlled study in wetlands in the USA found no differences in the number of species or relative cover of native and non-native plants between areas grazed by cattle and ungrazed areas. 
Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study along creeks in the USA found that similar percentages of planted willows survived in pastures with or without cattle excluded.
