2340: Habituate mammals to visitors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals can show aggressive behaviour towards humans. This can be a problem especially where the species is one in high demand from humans for opportunities to watch them, and one that is capable of causing serious injury or death to humans if it does attack. This is most likely to involve large charismatic carnivores. Where animals are predictable in their movements, there may be opportunities for habituating them to humans, thus reducing the risk to visitors. This may also, then, reduce instances in which there are pressures on wildlife managers to carry out lethal control of animals that show aggressive behaviours.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of habituating mammals to visitors. This study was in the USA.
