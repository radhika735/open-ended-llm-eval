2568: Restore or create savannas
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through under-grazing or burning suppression, savannah vegetation can revert to denser scrubland. Restoring savanna may benefit mammals typically associated with the habitat.
See also: Restore or create grassland.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of restoring or creating savannas. One study was in Senegal and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A replicated, randomized, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that restoring savannas by removing trees increased small mammal diversity.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): A study in Senegal found that in a population of dorcas gazelle translocated into a fenced enclosure where vegetation had been restored, births outnumbered deaths. A replicated, randomized, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that restoring savannas by removing trees did not, in most cases, change small mammal abundance.
