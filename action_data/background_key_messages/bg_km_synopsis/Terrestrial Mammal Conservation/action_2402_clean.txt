Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Establishing long-term cover on cropland that is highly susceptible to erosion may be carried out for a number of reasons including conserving soil fertility, limiting carbon emissions and enhancing habitat for biodiversity. The provision of long-term cover has potential to benefit mammals that are able to exploit increased shelter and food resources.
