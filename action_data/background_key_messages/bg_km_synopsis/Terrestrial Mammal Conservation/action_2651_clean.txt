2651: Retain wildlife corridors in logged areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Corridors are areas of habitat that are contiguous or isolated (i.e. linkages or stepping stones) that enable species to disperse and migrate through the landscape. In a managed forest environment, corridors may enable recolonization of isolated forest blocks. This intervention includes corridors of natural unharvested vegetation and of cover provided by arrangement of felling debris.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining wildlife corridors in logged areas. One study was in Australia and one was in Canada.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): A replicated study in Australia found that corridors of trees, retained after harvesting, supported seven species of arboreal marsupial. A replicated, controlled study in Canada found that lines of woody debris through clearcut areas that were connected to adjacent forest were not used more by red-backed voles than were isolated lines of woody debris.
