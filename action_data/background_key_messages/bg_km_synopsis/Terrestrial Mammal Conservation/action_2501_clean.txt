2501: Remove/control non-native invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Non-native invertebrates can affect mammals in a number of ways. Alterations to habitats and predation on other species could reduce feeding resources available to mammals and, in some cases, direct predation on mammals can occur (Masser & Grant 1986). Such effects can lead to mammals avoiding areas occupied by non-native invertebrates (Killion & Grant 1993). Control of such species may be carried out in an attempt to reverse these impacts.
