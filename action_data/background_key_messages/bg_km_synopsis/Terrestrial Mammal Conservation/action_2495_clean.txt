2495: Use fencing to exclude grazers or other problematic species
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In areas that are occupied by non-native grazers or where domestic animals range freely over large areas, fencing may be used to prevent grazing in some areas. This may benefit some native mammals, such as herbivores that may otherwise be outcompeted for food resources.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using fencing to exclude grazers or other problematic species. One study was in each of the USA, Australia and Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that after fencing to exclude introduced herbivores, native mammal species richness increased.

POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two controlled studies (including one replicated, paired sites study) in Spain and Australia found that using fences to exclude large or introduced herbivores increased the abundance of Algerian mice and native mammals. A replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that in areas fenced to exclude livestock grazing and off-road vehicles, abundance of black-tailed hares was lower compared to in unfenced areas.
