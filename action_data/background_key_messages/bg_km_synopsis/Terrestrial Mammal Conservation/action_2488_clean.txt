2488: Use target species distress calls or signals to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some animals, especially species that routinely form social groups, produce calls or other audible signals when they detect danger. If artificially playing calls or signals from the same species can restrict movements of animals, this may assist in reducing damage to crops. If effective, the intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such species.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of using target species distress calls or signals to deter crop damage by these species to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Two studies were in the USA and one each was in Namibia, Australia and Sri Lanka.

Human-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Two of five replicated studies (including four controlled studies), in the USA, Namibia, Australia and Sri Lanka, found that white-tailed deer and Asian elephants were deterred or repelled from areas by playing their respective distress calls. Two studies found that, in most cases, elephants and white-tailed deer were not deterred from entering or remaining at sites when distress calls were played. The fifth studyÂ found mixed results but, overall, eastern grey kangaroo foot-thumping noises did not increase numbers leaving a site.
