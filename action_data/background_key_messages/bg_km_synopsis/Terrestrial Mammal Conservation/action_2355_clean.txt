2355: Install underpasses beneath ski runs
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Infrastructure and land management associated with the ski industry has, on balance, a negative effect on mammals (Sato et al. 2013). One source of impact is habitat fragmentation, through construction of ski runs across previously forested slopes. Underpasses could facilitate mammal movements between habitat patches, especially if they mimic previous ground conditions across rocky slopes.
