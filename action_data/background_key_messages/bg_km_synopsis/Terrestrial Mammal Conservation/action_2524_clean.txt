2524: Dig trenches around culverts under roads/railways
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with vehicles can be a large cause of mortality for mammal species (e.g. Forman & Alexander 1998). Underpasses installed beneath roads or drainage culverts may be made accessible to mammals with the intention of increasing connectivity of habitats and reducing the animal-vehicle collision risk associated with crossing the road. A range of means may be employed to help funnel animals towards such crossing points. These are usually fences or similar barrier features to prevent animal crossings. However, trenches may be dug at some sites with the intention of inhibiting crossings, especially of small mammals.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of digging trenches around culverts under roads and/or railways. This study was in South Africa.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in South Africa found that digging trenches alongside culverts did not reduce mammal mortality on roads.
