2589: Control ticks/fleas/lice in wild mammal populations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Although the effects of parasites, such as ticks, fleas and lice, on their hosts are often undetectable, there can be serious adverse health effects of high parasite burdens, including reduced reproductive output and increased mortality (Wall 2007). Furthermore, in some cases, parasites can be carriers of disease that can have severe adverse effects on populations (e.g. Biggins & Kosoy 2001). Treatments, developed primarily for domestic animals, may be administered to wild mammals to reduce parasite burdens. The administering of such treatments, though, can be challenging.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of controlling ticks, fleas or lice in wild mammal populations. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Condition (2 studies): A replicated, paired sites, controlled study in the USA found that a grain-bait insecticide product did not consistently reduce flea burdens on Utah prairie dogs. A controlled study the USA found that treating wolves with ivermectin cleared them of infestations of biting dog lice.
