2640: Retain undisturbed patches during thinning operations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Thinning is a forestry practice that involves the selective removal of trees to reduce tree density and improve the growth rate, health and timber quality of remaining trees. Thinning has been done historically to maximize timber production but may have ecological benefits, such as opening up the canopy and allowing more light in, which may benefit some species. However, some species may benefit from the shelter available within retained undisturbed forest patches.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining undisturbed patches during thinning operations. Both studies were in the USA.

Use (2 studies): Two randomized, replicated, controlled studies (one also before-and-after) in the USA found that snowshoe hares and tassel-eared squirrels used retained undisturbed forest patches more than thinned areas.
