2508: Use ‘shock collars’ to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Using electric shock collars on mammalian herbivores is a form of aversive conditioning. A shock is administered if the animal wearing a ‘shock collar’ approaches a pre-determined area, containing a crop. The potential for the technique to be effective may be assessed using captive animals in controlled experimental settings. Whilst not directly assessing the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing crop damage, such studies may provide evidence as to the potential for shock collars to alter animals’ behaviour in a way that could potentially be applied to wild herbivores in crop production areas. If the intervention is successful, it may reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of such animals.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of using ‘shock collars’ to deter crop damage to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in the USA.

Human-wildlife conflict (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that electric shock collars (combined with loud noise) reduced damage caused by black-tailed deer to tree seedlings.
