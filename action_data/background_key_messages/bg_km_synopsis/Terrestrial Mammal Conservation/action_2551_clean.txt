2551: Retain/provide migration corridors
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals undertake long-distance migrations between sites occupied in different seasons. Some routes are used for such migrations by mammal populations over many generations. The availability of these routes may become especially important in the face of climate change, which may alter the duration over which some parts of an animal’s range are suitable. Habitat destruction and fragmentation may make some routes less suited for migrations, but their provision or retention may become increasingly important as climate change drives changes in seasonal land-use or migrations of mammal populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining or providing migration corridors.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
