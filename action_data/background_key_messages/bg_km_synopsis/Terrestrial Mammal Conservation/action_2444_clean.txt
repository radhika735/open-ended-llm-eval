2444: Deter predation of livestock by mammals by having people close by to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Domestic livestock may be vulnerable to mammalian predators. Livestock can be guarded by animals, especially dogs Canis lupus familiaris, or by people (or both). This intervention involves people remaining close to livestock, either actively guarding or simply as a passive deterrent, such as by bringing livestock in at night to an area adjacent to human habitation. If the intervention results in fewer livestock being predated, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of deterring predation of livestock by mammals by having people close by to reduce human-wildlife conflict. This study was in Kenya.
