2511: Use repellents that smell bad (‘area repellents’) to deter crop or property damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention covers use of manufactured repellents that emit a smell that is designed to repel animals from areas of crops or other property that is vulnerable to damage. If such repellents can prevent or reduce crop or property damage by wild mammals, this could reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of these animals.
