2520: Train captive-bred mammals to avoid predators
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mammals raised in captivity, free of predators, may be poorly adapted if released into areas where they are likely to encounter predators. It may be possible to train captive animals to avoid predators once they are released. This intervention covers specifically training attempts on captive-bred mammals. For wild mammals, see: Invasive and problematic species - Train mammals to avoid problematic species.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of training captive-bred mammals to avoid predators. One study was in Australia and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): A randomized, controlled study in the USA found that training captive-born juvenile black-tailed prairie dogs, by exposing them to predators, increased post-release survival.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): A before-and-after study in Australia found that rufous hare-wallabies could be conditioned to become wary of potential predators.
