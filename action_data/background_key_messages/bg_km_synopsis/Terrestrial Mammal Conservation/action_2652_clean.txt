2652: Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Retained riparian forest buffer strips can help to shield waterways from potentially negative impacts of tree harvesting, such as sedimentation. Such retained habitat may also enable persistence of forest mammals following clearfelling (Hannon et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvesting.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
