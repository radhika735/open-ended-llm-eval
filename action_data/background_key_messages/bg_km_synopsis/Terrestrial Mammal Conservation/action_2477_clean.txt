2477: Thin trees to reduce wildfire risk
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Through fire suppression, some forest areas have become denser than was the case under natural fire regimes. To reduce fuel loads and associated wildfire risk, trees may be thinned. By creating a more open woodland structure, this may encourage growth of herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees at lower levels, thus potentially providing increased resources for mammalian herbivores.
See also Biological resource use - Thin trees within forest, in which thinning is usually done for extraction of merchantable timber though reducing fuel loads may sometimes be a secondary motivation.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of thinning trees to reduce wildfire risk. All three studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): A replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that reducing tree density increased abundances of two of four small mammal species. A systematic review in the USA found that, in thinned forests, two mammal species were recorded in higher densities compared to in unmanaged forests, while three species showed no effect.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

(1 study): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that thinning followed by prescribed burning did not increase use of forest areas by North American elk in most season, stand age and sex comparisons.
