2627: Install crossings over/under pipelines
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Pipelines can extend hundreds of kms and may represent substantial barriers to mammal movements if they lie at or just above the surface of the ground. Crossing points can be either elevated sections of pipe with space for mammals to pass beneath, buried sections or sections with crossing ramps constructed over the pipe.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of installing crossings over/under pipelines. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Canada.

POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): A study in USA found that buried pipeline sections were used more frequently than their availability as crossing points by caribou. A study in USA found that pipeline sections elevated specifically to permit mammal crossings underneath were not used by moose or caribou more than were other elevated sections. A controlled study in Canada found that a range of large mammal species used wildlife crossings over pipelines.
