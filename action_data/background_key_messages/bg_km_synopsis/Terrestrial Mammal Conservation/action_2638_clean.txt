2638: Provide mammals with escape routes from canals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may be attracted to canals and other artificial waterways for drinking. When such waterways have steep sides, mammals may fall in and be unable to escape. Such waterways may also act as barriers to animal movements and mammals may attempt to cross them but be unable to exit the water whilst some aquatic mammals may also enter deliberately but struggle to exit the water. In such cases, mammals may be at risk of drowning (e.g. Peris & Morales 2004). Escape routes may be installed to enable mammals that have fallen in or otherwise entered the water to escape back onto land. These may take the form or ramps, ladders, shallow inlets or other structures that mammals could use to climb out.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing mammals with escape routes from canals. Two studies were in Germany and one each was in the USA, the Netherlands and Argentina.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): One of two studies (one before-and-after), in Germany and the USA, found that ramps and ladders reduced mule deer drownings whilst the other study found that ramps and shallow-water inlets did not reduce mammal drownings.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): Three studies (one replicated) in Germany, the Netherlands and Argentina, found that ramps and other access or escape routes out of water were used by a range of medium-sized and large mammals species.
