2431: Translocate predators for ecosystem restoration
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In areas where predators have historically been made locally extinct or populations severely reduced, often due to hunting, they may be translocated from other areas and released in an attempt to restore the ecosystem. Predators may help to reduce medium to large herbivore populations for example, and thus allow some recovery of the habitat and other species groups.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of translocating predators for ecosystem restoration. These studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)                               
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): A before-and-after study in the USA found that following reintroduction of wolves, populations of beavers and bison increased. A before-and-after study in the USA found that after the translocation of wolves to the reserve, adult elk numbers approximately halved.
Reproductive success (1 study): A before-and-after study in the USA found that after the translocation of wolves to the reserve, elk calf:cow ratios approximately halved.
