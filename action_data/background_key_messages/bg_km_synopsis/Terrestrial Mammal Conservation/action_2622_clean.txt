2622: Commercially breed for the mammal production trade
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some mammal species have economic value for products derived from them, such as fur. Captive breeding of these species, on a commercial scale, could reduce incentives for hunting or trapping wild individuals. This could, in turn, relieve pressures on populations of rare or threatened species.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of commercially breeding mammals for trade on wild populations of those species.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
