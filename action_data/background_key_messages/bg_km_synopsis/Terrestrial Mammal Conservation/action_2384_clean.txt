2384: Use conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some animals, such as bears, may exhibit “nuisance behaviour” that may bring them into conflict with humans. This may especially be caused by animals attempting to raid foodstuffs, such as at campgrounds, picnic areas or other places that people gather. As well as causing damage to property and spreading rubbish, such individuals may then be perceived as representing a threat to humans. As an alternative to lethal control, attempts may be made to make such animals associate human food sources with pain or discomfort by lacing foodstuffs with substances that cause gastrointestinal upset. If successful, such animals may subsequently avoid seeking out human sources of food.
Studies considered under this intervention are those concerning human-wildlife conflict away from permanent settlements. For related interventions, see also the Chapter, Residential and commercial development.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of using conditioned taste aversion to reduce human-wildlife conflict in non-residential sites. Both studies were in the USA.

Human-wildlife conflict (2 studies): Two studies, in the USA, found that lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness led to these foods being avoided by coyotes and black bears.
