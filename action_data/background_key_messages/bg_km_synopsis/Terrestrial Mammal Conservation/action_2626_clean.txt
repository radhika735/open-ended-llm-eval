2626: Close roads in defined seasons
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some mammals may avoid areas around roads (e.g. Rost & Bailey 1979). Closing these roads to traffic, especially at times of the year when they most use the habitat that the road runs through, may increase their use of such areas and, hence, increase their access to natural resources such as food and shelter.
