2617: Provide food/salt lick to divert mammals from roads or railways
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
‘Intercept feeding’ provides supplemental food sources in a particular location in an attempt to divert animals away from roads or railways. It is typically used as a technique aimed at ungulates, which can account for a large number of collisions between vehicles and wildlife (e.g. an estimated &gt;1 million deer-vehicle collisions annually in the USA, Conover et al. 1995).

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of providing food or salt licks to divert mammals from roads. One study was in the USA, one was in Norway and one was a review of studies from across North America and Europe.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that intercept feeding reduced mule deer road deaths along two of three highways in one of two years. A replicated, site comparison study in Norway found that intercept feeding reduced moose collisions with trains.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): A review of feeding wild ungulates in North America, and Europe found that feeding diverted ungulates away from roads in one of three studies.
