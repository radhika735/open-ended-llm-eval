2491: Grow unattractive crop in buffer zone around crops (e.g. chili peppers) to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some crops are vulnerable to wild herbivores, such as elephants. Some other crops, such as chilli, may have a repellent effect for wild herbivores. Planting them around the perimeter of the main crop may act as a deterrent to approach by such wild herbivores. If successful, this may reduce the incentives for carrying out lethal control of such herbivores.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of growing unattractive crops (such as chili peppers) in buffer zones around crops to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
