3823: Prohibit high grading in which only the most profitable individuals or species are landed
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
High grading is the practice by fishers of discarding marketable fish that have the lowest commercial value so they can land more fish of higher value (e.g. to maximise profit). It occurs in fisheries managed by catch limits (e.g. quotas/catch shares) or by measures requiring the landing of their total catch. Because survival of the discarded fish can be low, a ban on high grading may reduce overall fishing effort and mortality. In 2009, high grading was made an illegal practice in European Union waters. However, there is evidence that suggests its effectiveness may depend on the ability to detect and enforce it (Batsleer et al. 2015).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of prohibiting high grading in which only the most profitable individuals or species are landed on marine fish populations. The study was in the North Sea/North Atlantic Ocean (UK).

Commercial catch abundance/landings (1 study): One replicated, before-and-after study in the North Sea/North Atlantic Ocean reported that a ban on high grading did not eliminate the discarding of legal-sized but unwanted common megrim Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis that were required to be landed.
