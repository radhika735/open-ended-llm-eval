2736: Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact marine fish through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear contacting the seabed. For many fish species the reproductive potential (e.g. the annual numbers of eggs/young produced by the females) increases with size and/or age. Removal of the larger fish from a population thus reduces the overall reproductive potential and may also apply a genetic selection pressure that favours fish that mature at a smaller size that may continue breeding (Borrell 2013). Setting a maximum landing size (i.e. the largest fish measurement – usually total length – at which it is legal to retain a fish) may protect the largest fish with the highest reproductive potential, thus helping to maintain the population.
For similar interventions, see ‘Protect Reproductive Individuals - Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species’ and ‘Specify a size range of capture for commercially fished species’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
