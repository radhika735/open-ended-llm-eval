2813: Engage stakeholders/fishers in scientific research and data collection
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Engagement and agreement of stakeholders and fishers in scientific research and data collection is believed to be essential for shared problem solving and ultimately for any management plan to succeed (Mackinson et al. 2011). Engaging fishers to collect scientific data may improve the coverage of data and help give fishers a better understanding of the information underpinning management plans. This in turn may improve compliance and buy-in to proposals and help reduce the impacts of fishing.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of engaging fishers in scientific data collection on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
