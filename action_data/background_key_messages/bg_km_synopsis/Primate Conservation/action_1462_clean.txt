1462: Implement a minimum number of roads (& minimize secondary roads) needed to reach mining extraction sites 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The aim of this intervention is to ensure that mining operators keep the number of newly built primary and secondary roads at a minimum in order to limit negative road effects on biodiversity. This will involve careful planning prior to implementation. For this to be achieved, it is important that infrastructure engineers and natural resource managers work together to consider distributions of endangered plants and animals and their key spatial resources, habitat use during events such as wildlife migrations, as well as the economic viability when planning a new road network in an environmentally sensitive area (Caro et al. 2014).
            Re-using existing roads instead of building new roads is discussed under ‘Re-use old roads rather than building new roads’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of implementing a minimum number of roads needed to reach mining sites on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
