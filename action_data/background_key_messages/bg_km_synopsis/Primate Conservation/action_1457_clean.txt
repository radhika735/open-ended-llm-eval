1457: Install rope or pole (canopy) bridges
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Rope and pole bridges, or so-called ‘canopy bridges’, allow safe crossing of human-made barriers (e.g. roads) by arboreal primates that spend most of their time in the forest canopy.
     The use of green bridges (overpasses) to re-connect primate habitat and avoid primate road kills is discussed under ‘Install green bridges (overpasses)’.

Key Messages:

One study in Brazil found that black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road.
One before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased after the construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps.
One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines.
