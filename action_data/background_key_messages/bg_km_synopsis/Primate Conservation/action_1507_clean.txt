1507: Put up signs to warn people about not feeding primates 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The consumption of human food wastes or the feeding by tourists of primates can result in their dependency on the human provided food, their habituation to human contact, increased intra and inter-species aggression, and various health implications arising from artificial food sources causing injury and disease (Orams 2002). This intervention aims to reduce the negative impact of consumption of human food wastes by primates, by installing signage to warn people about not feeding primates.
            The implementation and enforcement of ‘no-feeding’ policies is discussed under ‘Implement a ‘no-feeding of wild primates’ policy’. The use of garbage bins inaccessible to primates is discussed under ‘Install ‘primate-proof’ garbage bins’. Prohibiting people from consuming food in natural primate habitat is discussed under ‘Do not allow people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them’.
