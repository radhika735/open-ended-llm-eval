1516: Use prescribed burning within the context of home range size and use 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Controlled burning alters forest structure and opens up the tree canopy, which can affect primates in different ways, depending on their habitat and ecology, as well as fire intensity, frequency and size of the burnt area. While some species, like the Siamang Symphalangus syndactylus, avoid fires, others, like some baboon- Papio spp., Guenon- Cercopithecus spp. and Macaque species Macaca spp., as well as western chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus, forage in burns and consume cooked fruits and seeds (Herzog et al. 2014). Furthermore, fire-induced primate range expansions have been observed and documented for yellow baboons Papio cynocephalus and vervet monkeys Chlorocebus aethiops. Prescribed burning may result in immediate foraging improvements post-fire, as well as delayed foraging opportunities in burned habitats. Therefore, controlled burning could potentially be used to promote primate conservation through improving foraging opportunities.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of using prescribed burning within the context of home range size and use on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
