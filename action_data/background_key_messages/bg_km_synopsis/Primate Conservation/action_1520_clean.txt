1520: Control inter-specific competition for food through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves removing animal species that compete with primates for food. This is an invasive intervention and its usefulness should be carefully considered from an ethical perspective before implementing it.
            Controlling predation by non-primate species is discussed under ‘Reduce primate predation by non-primate species through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation’, controlling predation by other primate species is discussed under ‘Reduce primate predation by other primate species through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation’, and controlling mammals that may alter the primate species’ habitat is discussed under ‘Control habitat-altering mammals (e.g. elephants) through exclusion (e.g. fences) or translocation’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of controlling inter-specific competition for food through exclusion or translocation on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
