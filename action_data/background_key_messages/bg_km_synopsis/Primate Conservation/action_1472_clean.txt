1472: Provide medicine to local communities to control killing of primates for medicinal purposes 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A review of primates in traditional folk medicine (Alves et al. 2010) found that at least 101 species of primates, belonging to 38 genera and 10 families, were used in traditional folk practices and in magic–religious rituals throughout the world. By providing medicine to local communities, it is hoped that fewer/no more primates will be killed for medicinal purposes.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of providing medicine to local communities to control the killing of primates for medicinal purposes on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
