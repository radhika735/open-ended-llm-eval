95: Provide bat boxes, bat grilles, improvements to roosts
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves providing artificial nest sites for bats or improvements to bat roosts. Summer roost sites where bats rest during the day may be found in buildings, hollow trees, under bridges or in caves (Entwistle et al. 2001). Artificial roost sites in the form of bat boxes can provide additional roosting habitat, they are typically made of wood and may be placed on buildings or trees (Entwistle et al. 2001). Existing roosting sites may be protected from disturbance by installing bat grilles. Grilles allow bats to access their roost sites whilst excluding humans (Mitchell-Jones 2004).

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of providing bat boxes, bat grilles or improvements to roosts on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
