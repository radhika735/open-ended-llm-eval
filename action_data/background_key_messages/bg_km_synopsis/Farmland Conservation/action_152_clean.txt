152: Manage heather, gorse or grass by burning
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:

This intervention may involve controlled burns to stimulate heather re-growth, modify the heathland/grassland plant communities or create a patchwork of heather of different ages.
See also ‘Maintain upland heath/moorland’ for studies that used burning as a management tool to maintain upland heath/moorland, and ‘Manage heather by swiping to simulate burning’ for studies that use swiping as an alternative to burning.

 

Key Messages:

A long-term replicated controlled trial in Switzerland found that annual spring burning of calcareous grassland did not increase plant species richness relative to abandoned plots, after 15 years.


A replicated controlled trial in Northern Ireland found that heather moorland subject to a single burn had more plant species eight years after the management, than control unburned plots.
