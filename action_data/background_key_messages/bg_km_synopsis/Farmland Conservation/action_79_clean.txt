79: Provide foraging perches (eg. for shrikes)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

 
If prey are plentiful but birds have low hunting success then it may be possible to increase population sizes by making hunting more effective, for example by providing perches for birds to use. 

 

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of providing foraging perches (eg. for shrikes) on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
