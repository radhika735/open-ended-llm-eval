91: Maintain rush pastures
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

Rush pastures are found in western Europe in lowland areas with poorly draining, typically acidic soils which receive high rainfall. Characteristic vegetation includes rushes such as sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus, as well as purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. This habitat is susceptible to agricultural modification and reclamation (UK BAP 2008).
