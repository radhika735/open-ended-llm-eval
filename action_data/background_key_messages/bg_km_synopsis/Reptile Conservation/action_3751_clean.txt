3751: Create or restore shrubland 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Loss of shrubland may be due to a range of factors, including too many grazing animals inhibiting regeneration of shrubs, too few grazing animals or fire suppression leading to reversion to woodland, or invasion by non-native species. Shrubland restoration or creation may benefit reptiles associated with the habitat.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of creating or restoring shrubland on reptile populations. This study was in Mexico.
