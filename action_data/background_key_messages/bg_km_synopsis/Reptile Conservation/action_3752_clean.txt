3752: Restore beaches
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Beach restoration may include vegetation management or removal of debris to maximise nesting site availability and access for reptiles. The process of dune re-mobilization is one commonly used management technique, though data is often insufficient for evaluating the impact of this intervention on reptile populations (e.g. Hill et al. 2018).
Studies that discuss physical rebuilding of beaches, for example by bringing sand to replenish a beach (‘beach nourishment’) are discussed in Threat: Natural system modifications – Restore or maintain beaches (‘beach nourishment’). Studies that discuss beach stabilization to protect against severe weather are discussed in Threat: Natural system modifications – Armour shorelines to prevent erosion.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of restoring beaches on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that removing beach debris from one section of beach did not increase nesting success in that section.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that after the removal of beach debris from one of three beach sections, a higher percentage of both the total nests laid and failed nesting attempts occurred in that section.
