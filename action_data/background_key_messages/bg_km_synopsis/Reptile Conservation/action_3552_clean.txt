3552: Reduce duration of time fishing gear is in the water
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reducing the length of time that the gear is left in the water (‘soak time’) reduces the opportunity for aquatic reptiles to become entangled in fishing gear. It may also reduce mortality rates, because when reptiles become entangled they are unable to reach the surface to replenish oxygen levels and so may drown.
See also: Limit the number of fishing vessels or fishing days in an area and Limit the length of fishing gear or density of traps in an area.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of reducing the duration of time fishing gear is in the water. One study was in the Gulf of Gabès (Tunisia) and one was in the Atlantic and North Pacific.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One randomized study in the Gulf of Gabès found that retrieving longlines immediately resulted in fewer loggerhead turtles dying compared to when line retrieval was delayed.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (2 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (2 studies): One randomized study in the Gulf of Gabès and one replicated study in the Atlantic and North Pacific found that the amount of time that longlines were in the water for did not affect the number of loggerhead turtles or leatherback and loggerhead turtles caught.
