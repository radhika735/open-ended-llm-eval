3616: Change hook baiting technique
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
How bait is connected to a hook may affect the likelihood of reptiles swallowing the bait and hook together. Changing the baiting technique may involve using whole bait instead of smaller chunks or changing the way that the bait is threaded onto a hook. Single baiting involves putting a fishing hook once through the bait item, whereas thread baiting involves threading the hook through the bait multiple times. As a result, it may be easier for reptiles to strip bait off fishing gear without swallowing the hooks when single baiting is used. Similarly, whole bait rather than chunks of bait may be more easily removed by reptiles.
