3631: Leave standing/deadwood snags in forests
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Standing and prone deadwood provides important microhabitat for some species and so removal of dead vegetation, for example to manage fire risk, may limit the distribution, abundance and species richness of reptiles in local areas (James & M’Closkey 2003).
For studies discussing leaving woody debris in place after logging or wood harvesting, see Leave woody debris in forests after logging. For studies discussing adding woody debris back to landscapes, see Habitat restoration and creation – Add woody debris to landscapes.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of leaving standing/deadwood snags in forests on reptile populations. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding snags and woody debris had mixed effects on reptile diversity and species richness when compared to not manipulating debris or removing debris. The other study found that increasing standing coarse woody debris had no effect on reptile diversity and species richness.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding snags and woody debris had mixed effects on reptile abundance when compared to not manipulating debris or removing debris. The other study found that increasing standing coarse woody debris had no effect on reptile abundance.
