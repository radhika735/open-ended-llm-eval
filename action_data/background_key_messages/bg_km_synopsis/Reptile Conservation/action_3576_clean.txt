3576: Use non-ringed hooks
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Ringed hooks are made of two parts: the hook itself which is connected to a separate ring that attaches to the line. Non-ringed hooks are in one piece that attaches directly to the line. Ringed hooks tend to be more mobile when underwater and this added mobility may increase the likelihood of sea turtles being caught.
Studies in this action specifically test whether non-ringed hooks are more or less likely to catch sea turtles than ringed hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to different types of J-hooks, see: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.
See also Use non-offset hooks and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test these variations in hook design. See also Modify number of hooks between floats on longlines.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using non-ringed hooks on reptile populations. This study was in the Mediterranean.

Unwanted catch (1 study): One replicated, paired study in the Mediterranean found that when non-ringed circle hooks were used in a swordfish longline fishery fewer loggerhead turtles were caught compared to when ringed hooks were used.
