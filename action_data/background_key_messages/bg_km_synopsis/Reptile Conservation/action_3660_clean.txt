3660: Regulate water levels 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Dams or ‘impoundments’ directly influence reptile populations, especially turtles, by fragmenting habitat and causing nest mortality through flooding via artificial stream regulations (e.g. artificially raising water levels in summer for boat navigation purposes; Bodie 2001). Undamming rivers and restoring ecological flow are both management interventions used to increase river health and change water levels (Bednarek 2001).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of regulating water levels on reptile populations. This study was in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in France found that autumn–spring marsh flooding with moderate levels of grazing in autumn–winter led to higher numbers of European pond turtles than winter–spring flooding with high levels of grazing in spring–summer.
