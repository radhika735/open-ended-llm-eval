3693: Protect nests and nesting sites from predation by creating new nesting sites
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
When suitable nesting habitat is limited, reptiles may nest at relatively high densities, and clusters of nests are more vulnerable to predation (Marchand & Litvaitis 2003). Increasing the available nesting habitat may reduce predation.
For other studies that discuss the effects of creating new nesting sites see Habitat restoration and creation.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation by creating new nesting sites on reptile populations. This study was in Spain.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Spain found that predation rate of artificial Hermann’s tortoise nests in newly created nesting sites was similar to the predation rate in natural nesting sites.
