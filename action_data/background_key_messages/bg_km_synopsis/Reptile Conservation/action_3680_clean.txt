3680: Offer reptile-related eco-tourism to improve behaviour towards reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Large numbers of tourists visiting important reptile habitats may pose a threat to wild reptile populations. Eco-tourism may help to promote reptile conservation and raise funds for conservation and research, as well as providing an opportunity for tourists to observe and experience wild reptiles while keeping disturbance to a minimum. However, where eco-tourism is not carefully regulated, increased levels of human disturbance may end up being detrimental to reptile populations (Iverson et al. 2006).

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on reptile populations of offering reptile-related eco-tourism to improve behaviour towards reptiles. One study was in the USA and one was in St Kitts and Nevis.

Human behaviour change (1 study): One study in the USA reported that 32% of respondents to a survey said they would have gone to look for a nesting turtle if they had not been able to join a supervised turtle watch. One study in St Kitts and Nevis found that people who attended a leatherback turtle tour reported that they would be more conscientious of how their behaviours on the beach affected sea turtles.
