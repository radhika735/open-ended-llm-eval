3703: Sterilize equipment to prevent spread of disease
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The movement of field biologists between different sites increases the risk of spreading wildlife diseases. Precautions therefore need to be taken to reduce the risk of spreading diseases between sites and populations. This is also the case within and between captive populations. A range of methods may be used to sterilize equipment, including using disinfectants, heating and drying.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of sterilizing equipment to prevent spread of disease.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
