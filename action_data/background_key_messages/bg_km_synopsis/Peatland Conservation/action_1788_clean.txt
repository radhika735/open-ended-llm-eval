1788: Remove oil from contaminated peatlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Peatlands may be affected by oil spills. North American peatlands are particularly vulnerable to oil spills from pipelines or wells: oil is extracted from large reserves in Alaska and Alberta, then transported long distances over peatlands. Spontaneous vegetation recovery following oil spills can be slow (Racine 1994). Interventions to remove oil, or increase microbial activity to break down oil more rapidly, include washing, burning, tillage, aeration and fertilization (Jorgenson & Joyce 1994; ExxonMobil 2008). Historical oil spills, such as those from wrecked military vehicles (Ardron 2013), may be harder or impossible to clean.
Caution: Interventions to clean up oil spills could kill any surviving vegetation and/or churn oil into the peat, hindering long term recovery in some situations. 
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: use artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands, or spreading from an initial source of pollution.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of removing oil from contaminated peatlands.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
