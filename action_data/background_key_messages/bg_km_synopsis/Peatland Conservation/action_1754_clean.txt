1754: Wear snowshoes to prevent trampling
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Walking on peatlands can damage the vegetation and compress or erode the peat. Pedestrians are a particular problem when they repeatedly walk on the same area of peatland e.g. in popular tourist areas or when scientists make repeat visits to sample plots (Edwards 1977). Wearing snowshoes could spread the weight of people walking on peatlands and minimise trampling impacts.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: use specialized low impact vehicles for harvest; restrict pedestrian access to peatlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of wearing snowshoes to prevent trampling.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
