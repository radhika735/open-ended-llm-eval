1787: Use biodegradable oil in farming machinery
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Lubricating oil could spill or leak from machinery used on agricultural land, or to harvest plants from natural peatlands. Using biodegradable oil could reduce impacts from oil spillage, as it will not persist in the environment (Dubowski et al. 2013).
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of using biodegradable oil in farming machinery.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
