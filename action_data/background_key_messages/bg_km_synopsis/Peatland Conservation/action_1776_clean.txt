1776: Use herbicide to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides are plant-killing chemicals. They can be applied to an entire peatland area, or specifically applied to individual plants (typically shrubs and trees).
Caution: Herbicides are not recommended as general conservation tool. Many are not specific to the target plant so can cause collateral damage. Many have negative effects side effects on biodiversity, the environment and human health (Pimentel et al. 1992). Accordingly, herbicide use is being reduced or banned in many countries.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of using herbicide to control problematic plants. The study was in fens.
Plant community composition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in fens in the USA found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) changed the overall plant community composition.
Tree/shrub cover (1 study): The same study found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that applying herbicide to shrubs (along with other interventions) prevented increases in plant species richness.
