1777: Introduce an organism to control problematic plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers biological control: controlling problematic organisms by managing their enemies. Typically, this involves releasing natural enemies of target problematic organisms, such as microorganisms (e.g. a virus or a fungus), insects or parasitic plants. More enemies usually equals more damage to the target organisms. Biological control could be particularly effective for non-native problematic plants: their success in their new range may be due to escape from natural enemies in their native range (Keane & Crawley 2002).
Caution: Organisms introduced for biological control can themselves become problematic pests (e.g. the harlequin ladybird; Roy et al. 2016) or could damage non-target plants. Introductions should not be carried out without thorough assessment of likely negative impacts, non-target effects and effectiveness of control.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related action: ‘introduce’ large grazing vertebrates, such as sheep or cows, to control problematic plants.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of introducing an organism (other than large vertebrate grazers) to control problematic plants. The study was in a fen meadow.
Plant community composition (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in a fen meadow in Belgium found that introducing a parasitic plant altered the overall plant community composition.
Vegetation cover (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant reduced cover of the dominant sedge but increased moss cover.
Overall plant richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that introducing a parasitic plant increased overall plant species richness.
