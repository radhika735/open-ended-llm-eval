Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Public education programmes on the risks of invasive gobies and the mechanisms of spread could reduce the translocation of gobies into new water bodies, thereby reducing population spread.
 

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the impact of education programmes on control of goby populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
