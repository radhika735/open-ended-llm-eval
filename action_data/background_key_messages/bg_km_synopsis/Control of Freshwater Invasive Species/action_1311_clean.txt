1311: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Public education
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
C. helmsii can easily be dispersed between water bodies via a variety of management and recreational activities. Public education about the species and the need to decontaminate equipment could reduce the spread of C. helmsii from ornamental ponds and aquaria, and between natural water bodies. Direct sales of the species were banned in the UK in 2014.
