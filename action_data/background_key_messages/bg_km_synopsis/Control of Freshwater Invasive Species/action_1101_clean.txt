1101: Skunk cabbage:  Physical removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Due to the sensitive ecosystems where skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus occurs, mechanical removal can be a useful method by which to control the population, particularly in the early years of infestation since only older plants of three years or older are capable of producing seeds (EPPO 2009).  It is likely that the whole plant needs to be removed in order to be effective, as partial removal reportedly leads to vegetative reproduction and a high level of regeneration (Fuchs et al. 2003).

Key Messages:

A study in Switzerland found that annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock. 
A study in the Netherlands found that manual removal of mature skunk cabbage plants was effective for a small outbreak of a small-growing plant.
A study in Germany reported that after the first four years of a twice yearly full removal programme of skunk cabbage, a large number of plants still needed to be removed each year.
