1029: <i>Procambarus</i> crayfish control: Trapping and removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Traps are commercially available for crayfish capture. They are typically baited with food items and set overnight, after which crayfish are disposed of in a humane way. A number of studies have investigated the use of trapping to control other invasive crayfish species. A replicated study from the UK (Holdich & Black 2007) found that trapping spiny-cheeked crayfish Orconectes limosus was ineffective at managing populations. Another before and after study in Spain (Dana et al. 2010) demonstrated that a combination of trapping, manual removal and electrofishing controlled recruitment of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus.  However, trapping contributed towards only approximately 3% of the total crayfish removed in this Spanish study.

Key Messages:

One controlled, replicated study in Italy found that baiting traps with food (tinned meat) trapped the most red swamp crayfish compared to the use of male and female pheromones or the control (no bait). Over half of all crayfish caught were found in traps baited with food.
