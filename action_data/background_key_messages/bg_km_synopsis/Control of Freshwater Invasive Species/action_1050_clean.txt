1050: Brown and black bullheads: Application of a biocide 
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Biocides may offer a tool for localised eradication or population reduction of bullheads, provided potentially negative effects on native species are carefully managed.
Rotenone has been successfully used to control populations of bullheads and other fish.  For example, in the UK, studies have reported that rotenone successfully reduced or eradicated populations of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and fathead minnows Pimephales promelas, from ponds and lakes (Britton et al. 2008; Britton et al. 2011).  A risk assessment for piscicidal formulations of rotenone suggests that mortality of bullheads can be achieved with 5-100 parts per billion of rotenone active ingredient, or 100-200 parts per billion of rotenone active ingredient in organic rich ponds, diluted in 38 litres of water, although no scientific evidence was provided (Turner et al. 2007).
It has been suggested that Antimycin is less useful for control of bullheads than rotenone as Antimycin is very toxic to scaled fishes, but is much less toxic to scaleless catfishes (Order Siluriformes), which includes the bullheads (Clearwater et al. 2008).

Key Messages:

A study in the UK reported that use of a piscicide containing rotenone achieved eradication of black bullhead.
A study in the USA found that rotenone successfully eradicated black bullhead, but one of two ponds required two separate doses.
