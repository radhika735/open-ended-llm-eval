1102: Skunk cabbage:  Chemical control using herbicides
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Application of chemical herbicides may offer a tool for management of skunk cabbage Lysichiton americanus provided regulatory approvals are in place.
 

Key Messages:

A study in the UK found that two herbicides, glyphosate and 2, 4-D Amine, both killed all skunk cabbage plants in test areas. However, another study in the UK found that although using 2,4-D amine at 9 litres/ha, successfully eradicated skunk cabbage, using glyphosate was unsuccessful at eradicating skunk cabbage, with only limited reduction in growth of the plants.
