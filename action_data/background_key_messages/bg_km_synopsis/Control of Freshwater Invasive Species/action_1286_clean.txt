1286: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use hot foam to control plants
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Hot foam has been used proposed as an approach for controlling vegetation. A biodegradable, plant-based foam allows heat to remain in contact with plant surfaces for a longer period than using hot water, with the aim of rupturing plant cells and killing the plant.
The use of hot water to control C. helmsii is discussed in ‘Use hot water’.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that treatment with hot foam, along with other treatments, did not reduce cover of Crassula helmsii. One before-and-after study in the UK found that applying hot foam partially destroyed C. helmsii.
