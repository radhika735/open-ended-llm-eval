1291: <i>Crassula helmsii</i>: Use flame-throwers to control plants
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The heat from flame-throwers can be used to destroy vegetation, and could therefore be used to control emergent C. helmsii vegetation. However, flame-throwers may not produce enough heat to kill the roots and will not be effective on underwater plants, so would need to be used in combination with other approaches (Leach & Dawson 2000).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence on the use of flame-throwers to control Crassula helmsii.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
