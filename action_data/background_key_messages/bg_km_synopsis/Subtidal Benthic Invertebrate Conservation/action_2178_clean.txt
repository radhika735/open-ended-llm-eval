2178: Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of untreated sewage
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Untreated sewage reaching the marine environment can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through the introduction of bacteria, excess nutrients, toxic substances and solid particles, and through changes in salinity (McGann et al. 2003). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the dumping of untreated sewage in an area may benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates by reducing or stopping the source of pollution and allowing communities to potentially recover over time (Bustamante et al. 2012).
Evidence for other interventions related to sewage pollution are summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Limit, cease or prohibit the dumping of sewage sludge”, “Set or improve minimum sewage treatment standards”, and “Limit the amount of storm wastewater overflow”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the dumping of untreated sewage on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
