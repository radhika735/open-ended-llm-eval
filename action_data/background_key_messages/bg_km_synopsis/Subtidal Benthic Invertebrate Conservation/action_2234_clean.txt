2234: Designate a Marine Protected Area and limit the number of fishing vessels
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear entering in contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Specific areas can be designated as protected, and specific management measures taken to limit the number of fishing vessels allowed. This could potentially reduce fishing effort in the protected area, thereby reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates. However, species and populations are still subjected to the effects of other allowed activities (for instance hand harvest or recreational boating).
Evidence related to similar intervention outside of a protected area are summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Limit the number of fishing vessels”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of designating a Marine Protected Area and limiting the number of fishing vessels on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
