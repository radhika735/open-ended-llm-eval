2183: Remove or clean-up oil pollution following a spill
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Oil spills can be disastrous to marine life, including subtidal benthic invertebrates (White et al. 2012). The control and remediation of oil spills can be undertaken in a multitude of ways: for instance by using booms (floating barriers that contain a spill to a delimited zone) and skimmers (devices that collect and remove oil) to remove oil pollution from the surface of the water, using dispersants that break oil into small droplets (Hartwick et al. 1982), using sorbents, or using controlled burning of the oil (Al-Majed et al. 2012). Different methods have different outcomes and side-effects, but when successful may potentially reduce the risks of toxicity and direct harm to subtidal benthic invertebrates.
Evidence for related interventions is summarised under “Threat: Pollution – Use double hulls to prevent oil spills” and “Establish pollution emergency plans”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of removing and cleaning-up oil pollution following a spill on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Baltic Proper (Sweden).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Mollusc condition (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the Baltic Proper found that after cleaning-up spilled oil using high pressure hot water, crude oil content increased in mussels and did not naturally decrease over time, and was higher than in mussels from an uncleaned contaminated and a non-contaminated site.
