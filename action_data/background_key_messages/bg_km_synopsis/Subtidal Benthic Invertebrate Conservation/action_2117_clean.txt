2117: Use hook and line fishing instead of other fishing methods
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hook and line fishing is a term used for a range of fishing methods that use short fishing lines with hooks. Hook and line fishing is more selective than other types of fishing and has little impact on the seabed. In addition, unwanted catch species can often be returned to the sea undamaged because the lines are only in place for a short time. These methods also reduce direct contact with the seabed, any unintentional physical harm and disturbances, and potentially reduce the amount of unwanted catch. For evidence of the effect of this intervention within a marine protected area, see “Habitat protection – Designate a Marine Protected Area and only allow the use hook and line fishing instead of other fishing methods”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using hook and lime fishing instead of other fishing methods on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
