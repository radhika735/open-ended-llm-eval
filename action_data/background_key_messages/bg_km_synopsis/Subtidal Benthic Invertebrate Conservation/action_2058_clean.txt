2058: Use stabilisation material that can be more easily recovered at decommissioning stage
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Stabilisation material, such as concrete mattresses and rocks (rock dump), can be used to keep pipelines and infrastructure (from offshore industry structures, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and mining or aggregate extraction) in place and may also help to protect the infrastructure (for instance from fishing gears) by covering them. Stabilisation material may need to be recovered following decommissioning, and their retrieval might cause additional physical disturbances to the seabed and to subtidal benthic invertebrates. Stabilisation materials designed to be easily recovered at the decommissioning stage can help reduce the level of habitat disturbance associated with this process. Evidence for interventions related to the decommissioning of offshore infrastructures and pipelines are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining – Remove pipelines and infrastructure following decommissioning” and “Leave pipelines and infrastructure in place following decommissioning”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using stabilisation material that can be more easily recovered at decommissioning stage on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
