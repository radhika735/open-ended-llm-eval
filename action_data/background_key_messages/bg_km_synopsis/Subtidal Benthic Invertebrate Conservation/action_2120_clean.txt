2120: Use lower water pressure during hydraulic dredging
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Some species, such as bivalves, can be fished using hydraulic dredges (Moschino et al. 2003). Using a hydraulic dredge can negatively affect subtidal benthic invertebrates due to direct physical damage, and changes to the seabed structure and topography (Gilkinson et al. 2003). Using a lower water pressure may potentially result in less damage or stress to organisms and theseabed.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using lower water pressure during hydraulic dredging on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
