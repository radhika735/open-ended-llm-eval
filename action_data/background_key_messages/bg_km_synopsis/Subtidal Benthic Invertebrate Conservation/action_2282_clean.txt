2282: Organise educational marine wildlife tours to improve behaviours towards marine invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine wildlife tours can be highly educational for visitors and provide conservation benefits (Zeppel & Muloin 2008). This has in part been linked to emotional and affective responses. Visitors can also learn about the biology, ecology, and behaviour of marine species; best practice guidelines; and human threats to marine life, during educational marine wildlife tours. Studies have shown that visitors who attended the tours wanted to be educated about marine issues (Lück 2003). Such tours have been linked to behavioural and intentional changes, increased empathy towards marine wildlife and increased engagement in marine conservation actions (Zeppel 2008).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of organising educational marine wildlife tours to induce behavioural changes and increase engagement in marine conservation on human behaviour and/or subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
