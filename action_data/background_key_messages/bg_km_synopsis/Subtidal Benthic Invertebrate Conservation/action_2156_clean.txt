2156: Implement quarantine to avoid accidental introduction of disease, non-native or problem species
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The expanding aquaculture industry has led to the accidental introduction of diseases, and non-native and other problematic species into the wild marine environment (Bax et al. 2003; Hewitt et al. 2004; Manchester & Bullock 2000). There, they can impact on native subtidal benthic invertebrate species through predation, competition for resources (food & space), contamination (for pathogens and diseases), or hybridization (through reproduction) (Bishop et al. 2010). This could be potentially avoided through the implementation of quarantine procedures (Campbell 2011; Reise et al. 1998).
Evidence for related interventions are summarised under “Threat: Invasive and other problematic species, genes and diseases – Implement regular inspections to avoid accidental introduction of disease or non-native or problem species”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of implementing quarantine to avoid accidental introduction of disease, non-native or problem species on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
