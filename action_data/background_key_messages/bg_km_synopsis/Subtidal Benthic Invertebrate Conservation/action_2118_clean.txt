2118: Use a midwater/semi-pelagic trawl instead of bottom/demersal trawl
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net (trawl) through the water behind one or more vessels. Semi-pelagic trawls (also referred to as midwater trawls) are types of trawls where the nets are towed through the water above the seabed, whereas demersal trawls (also referred to as bottom trawls) tow their nets along, or close to, the seabed. Semi-pelagic trawl gear does not come into contact with the seabed, resulting in less damage to the seabed. Using a semi-pelagic trawl instead of a demersal trawl may potentially reduce the impact on the seabed and disturbances or damages to subtidal benthic invertebrates (Moran & Stephenson 2000).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of using a semi-pelagic trawl instead of a demersal trawl on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study was in the Indian Ocean (Australia).

 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Indian Ocean found that fishing with a semi-pelagic trawl did not reduce the abundance of large sessile invertebrates, which was similar to non-trawled plots, but a demersal trawl did.

OTHER (1 STUDY)

Commercial catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, study in the Indian Ocean found that fishing with a semi-pelagic trawl reduced the abundance of retained commercially targeted fish compared to fishing with a demersal trawl.
