1894: Amphibians: Manipulate larval density within the enclosure 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Some species of amphibian larvae are known to cannibalize other individuals in the enclosure if animal density is too high. It is also thought that growth could be reduced when larvae are too densely housed. 

Key Messages:

A replicated study in the USAÂ found that reducing larval density of spotted salamanders increased larval survival and body mass.
