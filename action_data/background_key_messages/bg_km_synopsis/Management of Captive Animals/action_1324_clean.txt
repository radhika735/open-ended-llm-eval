1324: Primates: Present feeds at different crowd levels
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Crowd levels within zoos vary. At some zoos crowds could consist of up to hundreds of people at an enclosure at any one time. This can affect the behaviour of captive primates. The aim of presenting feeds at different crowd levels is to see when is best (high or low crowd levels) to give food to increase foraging time.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the USA found that when smaller crowds were present foraging and object use in chimpanzees increased.
