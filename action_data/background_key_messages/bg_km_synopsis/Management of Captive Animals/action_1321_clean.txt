1321: Primates: Present food frozen in ice
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Whole pieces of food can be lightly frozen or frozen within juice and introduced to primates as a novelty. The food will be of an unexpected temperature and texture, which will change as the food warms slowly to ambient temperature. The aim is to increased activity levels and more natural foraging behaviours.
 
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated and before-and-after studies in the USA and Ireland, found that when food was presented in ice, feeding time increased and inactivity decreased.
