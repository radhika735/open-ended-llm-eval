18: Sow uncropped arable field margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Arable field margins are the focus of some specific European agri-environment measures. This section covers nectar and pollen seed mixes comprising agricultural forage plants or non-native plants, designed to provide nectar and pollen sources for bees and other flower-visiting insects. For nectar and pollen mixes exclusively composed of native wild flowers, see Sow uncropped arable field margins with a native wild flower seed mix.

Key Messages:
Five replicated trials in Europe (three controlled) have documented bumblebees foraging on field margins sown with an agricultural nectar and pollen seed mix. Four replicated trials showed that field margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated (two trials), grassy (four trials) or cropped (three trials) field margins. Three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants including legumes (all annual plants in one trial) attracts greater numbers of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year.
Three trials in the UK found evidence that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in their value to bumblebees and would need to be re-sown every few years.
We have captured no evidence on the effects of field margin management on solitary bees.
