21: Increase the diversity of nectar and pollen plants in the landscape for bees
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
We have captured no direct evidence on the effects of managing elements of landscape such as areas of natural or semi-natural habitat, or crop diversity, to enhance nectar and pollen resources. One piece of evidence demonstrates that enhancing the quantity of planted nectar and pollen resources at the landscape (10 km²) scale benefits bees.

Key Messages:
One large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square.
