3294: Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting trees/shrubs: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment (and any vegetation on it), without permanently removing any soil/sediment. Mechanical disturbance could be carried out by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying. It may improve survival or growth of planted vegetation. It can clear potentially competing vegetation, and loosen up the soil to allow roots to penetrate more easily.
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting, including by deep ploughing.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of freshwater wetlands before planting trees/shrubs.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
