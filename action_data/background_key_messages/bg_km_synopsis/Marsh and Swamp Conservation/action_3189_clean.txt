3189: Restore/create brackish/saline swamps in areas that will be climatically suitable in the future
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
It may be wise to prioritize restoration or creation of swamps in areas that will remain – or become more – climatically suitable in the future, rather than areas that are destined to become unsuitable. These areas will provide space for existing vegetation to move into as their current sites become to dry, wet, warm or cold (Oliver et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of restoring or creating brackish/saline swamps in areas expected to be climatically suitable in the future. The study was in South Africa.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One before-and-after study in an estuary in South Africa reported that over 42 years after planting mangrove trees just beyond their current range, the area of mangrove forests increased.
