3303: Add lime or similar chemicals before/after planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves adding chemicals – such as lime (CaO or Ca(OH)2), limestone (CaCO3), magnesium oxide (MgO), fly ash (residue from burning coal) and biochar (a type of charcoal) – to areas planted with marsh or swamp vegetation. These calcium and/or magnesium-rich chemicals may reduce acidity and modify nutrient availability (Weil & Brady 2016), potentially increasing plant survival or growth.
Related actions: Add lime or similar chemicals to wetlands, other than to complement planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding neutralizing chemicals to brackish/saline wetlands planted with trees/shrubs.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
