3371: Heat seeds of non-woody plants before sowing: freshwater wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Heating seeds before planting can help to break seed dormancy and encourage germination. Seeds of some species (with physiological dormancy) must experience high temperatures before germinating, in order to break down chemicals that inhibit germination or stop the production of these chemicals. For other species (with physical dormancy), heat can increase the permeability of the seed coat to water and gases, which are essential for germination. For a database of seed dormancy class by species, see Baskin & Baskin (2014).
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have explicitly compared the performance of treated and untreated seeds. Studies that simply report the performance of treated seeds are not summarized here. Studies do not have to be in flooded/saturated soils, as long as they involve wetland-characteristic species,
Related actions: Soak seeds before sowing; Chill seeds before sowing; Expose seeds to light before sowing; Physically damage seeds before sowing; Treat seeds with chemicals before sowing.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects – on emergent, non-woody plants typical of freshwater wetlands – of heating their seeds before sowing. The study was in a greenhouse in the USA.

Germination/emergence (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a greenhouse in the USA found that sawgrass Cladium jamaicense seeds dipped in hot water or dried in an oven before sowing had a similar germination rate to seeds that had not been heated.
