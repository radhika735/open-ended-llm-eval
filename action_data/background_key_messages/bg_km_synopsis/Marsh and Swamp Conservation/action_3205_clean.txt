3205: Lower water level to restore/create brackish/saline swamps from other land uses
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves one-off action to lower the water level and restore or create swamps from other land uses, i.e. in areas that do not retain substantial characteristics of the target habitat. By definition, these other land uses will always be aquatic habitats such as reservoirs or lakes. The lowered water level should not depend on continued intervention (e.g. pumping). Specific techniques to reduce water levels include removing dams downstream, or switching off pumps that add water to a focal site. This action includes water level reductions to any depth that could, in theory, support emergent wetland vegetation.
Caution: This action may have negative effects on habitats elsewhere in the catchment. For example, removing dams could flood marshes, swamps or upland habitats downstream. There may also be conflicts with water needs of human populations that need to be managed.
Related actions: Lower water level to restore degraded swamps; Backfill canals or trenches; Actively manage water level; Reprofile/relandscape, which may involve raising the ground surface towards or above the water table; Lower water level to complement planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of lowering the water level to restore/create brackish/saline swamps from other land uses or habitat types.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
