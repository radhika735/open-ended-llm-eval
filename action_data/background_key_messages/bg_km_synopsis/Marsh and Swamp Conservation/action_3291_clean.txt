3291: Bury surface soil/sediment (before planting)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The surface soil/sediment of degraded wetlands – and any vegetation on it – could be buried under deeper layers, for instance by deep ploughing. Burial can create bare soil/sediment with spaces for desirable plants to grow, prevent undesirable plants from growing from seeds already in the soil, remove excess nutrients that favour growth of undesirable weedy plants, and remove any contaminants or pollutants (Glen et al. 2017). Inverting, rather than removing, the upper soil layer maintains the ground level.
Caution: Heavy machinery is usually needed for this action. Heavy vehicles can churn and compress wetland soils (Campbell et al. 2002).
Related actions: Bury surface soil/sediment, other than to complement planting; Remove surface soil/sediment before planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of burying surface soil/sediment before planting emergent marsh/swamp plants.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
