2949: Implement ‘mosaic management’ of farmland
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways, across large scales. For example, patches of agricultural land or aquaculture pools could be interspersed with natural marsh vegetation that is never harvested or sustainably harvested. Alternatively, in a set of fields or farms, half could be cultivated at any one time whilst half are left undisturbed. Note that mosaic management involving marshes or swamps may only be possible if the farmed areas are kept wet: draining patches of land for agriculture can lower the entire local water table.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have considered the overall effectiveness of mosaic management, comparing marsh or swamp vegetation across the whole mosaic to an area not under mosaic management (e.g. traditional farmland or nature reserves; Oosterveld et al. 2010). Studies comparing vegetation between individual patches would be summarized elsewhere in the synopsis.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh/swamp vegetation, of implementing mosaic management in agricultural systems.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
