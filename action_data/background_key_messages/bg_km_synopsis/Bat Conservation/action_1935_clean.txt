1935: Legally protect bats during development
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Bats are protected by national and/or international law in many countries. This typically includes protection against killing, injuring, capturing, disturbing or trading bats, or damaging, destroying, or obstructing access to their roosts. Activities such as development that are likely to affect bats in these ways may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
The studies discussed here relate specifically to protecting bats during development. Other studies that discuss legal protection are included in ‘Legally protect bat habitats’, and ‘Legally protect bat species’.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of legally protecting bats by issuing licences during development on bat populations. The four studies were in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Change in human behaviour (2 studies): One review in the UK found that the number of development licences for bats more than doubled over three years in Scotland. One review in the UK found that 81% of licensees did not carry out post-development monitoring to assess whether bats used the roost structures installed.

OTHER (3 STUDIES) 

Impact on bat roost sites (3 studies): One review in the UK found that licenced activities during building developments had a negative impact on bat roosts, with 68% of roosts being destroyed. One replicated, before-and-after study in the UK found that five of 28 compensation roosts provided under licence were used, and two by similar or greater numbers of bats after development. One review in the UK found that 31–67% of compensation roosts provided under licence were used by bats.
