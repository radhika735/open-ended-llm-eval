1929: Install sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and areas occupied by humans within developments
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sound-proofing insulation installed between bat roosts and areas occupied by humans within developments may reduce the risk of bats being disturbed by noise. This could also reduce the potential for humans to be disturbed by noise from bat roosts and may therefore reduce human-wildlife conflict. For a more general intervention that involves installing sound barriers, see ‘Install sound barriers in proximity to bat roosts and habitats’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of installing sound-proofing insulation between bat roosts and areas occupied by humans within developments on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
