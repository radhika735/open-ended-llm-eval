1995: Minimize noise levels within caves
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Noise may disturb bats within caves, causing arousal during hibernation or roost abandonment. Noise levels may be minimised by restricting the number or timing of tourist visits or by asking tourists to remain quiet during tours. See also ‘Impose restrictions on cave visits’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of minimizing noise levels within caves on bat populations. The study was in the USA.

Behaviour change (1 study): One controlled study in the USA found that experimental cave tours with groups that did not talk resulted in fewer bat flights than when groups did talk, but talking did not have an effect on the number of bat movements.
