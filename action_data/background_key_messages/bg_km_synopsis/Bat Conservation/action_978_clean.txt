978: Install bat gantries or bat bridges as road/railway crossing structures for bats
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Bat gantries, or bat bridges, are purpose-built structures designed to act as linear features that will guide echolocating bats over roads at a safe height above traffic. They typically consist of wood or metal pylons erected on either side of the road with wires or mesh over the road between them. The aim is to both reduce the number of bats killed on roads and increase the permeability of roads to maintain connectivity for bats across the landscape. Studies have been summarised below if they provide data that can be used to assess effectiveness, such as a control or the proportion of bats that are or are not using bat gantries.
Bat gantries, or bat bridges, may also be built over railways, although we found no studies that assessed this. For evidence relating to overpasses (solid structures such as bridges built for pedestrians or vehicles), see ‘Install overpasses as road/railway crossing structures for bats’.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of installing bat gantries as road crossing structures for bats. Two studies were in the UK and one in France.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)      

Use (3 studies): Two replicated studies (including one site comparison) in the UK found that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all. One replicated study in France found that a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations.
