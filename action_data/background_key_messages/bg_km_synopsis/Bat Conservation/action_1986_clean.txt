1986: Manage forest and woodland to encourage understorey growth
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The amount of understorey vegetation within forests and woodland has an influence on insect abundance, predation risk and the ability of bats to access the stand interior. Different bat species have been found to prefer different amounts of understorey vegetation, depending on their wing morphology and foraging strategy (e.g. Jung et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of managing forest and woodland to encourage understorey growth on bat populations. The study was in Germany.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One paired sites study in Germany found more bat species and higher bat diversity in a forest managed to encourage understorey growth than in a managed forest without understorey growth.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One paired sites study in Germany found higher overall bat activity (relative abundance) in a forest managed to encourage understorey growth than in a managed forest without understorey growth.
