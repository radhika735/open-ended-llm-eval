1951: Manage livestock water troughs as a drinking resource for bats
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Livestock water troughs can provide water sources for bats, particularly in arid areas. Modifications to water troughs that prevent livestock from damaging or entering them, such as wires and braces across the water surface, may injure bats or prevent them from drinking. Removing livestock modifications, keeping water troughs full and managing surrounding vegetation may increase the use of troughs by bats. Carefully designed escape structures may also prevent downed bats from drowning (e.g. see Taylor & Tuttle 2012).
For studies that avoid illuminating livestock water troughs, see ‘Avoid illumination of bat foraging, drinking, and swarming sites’. For studies that create water sources on farmland and in other habitats, see ‘Create artificial water sources’.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of managing livestock water troughs as a drinking resource for bats. Both studies were in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)      

Use (2 studies): One replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that removing livestock modifications from water troughs resulted in bats drinking from them more frequently. One paired sites study in the USA found that livestock water tanks that were larger, full of water or surrounded by sparse vegetation had more bats drinking from them than smaller, half full tanks surrounded by no or dense vegetation.
Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the USA found that when livestock modifications were removed from water troughs, bats approached troughs fewer times before successfully drinking from them.
