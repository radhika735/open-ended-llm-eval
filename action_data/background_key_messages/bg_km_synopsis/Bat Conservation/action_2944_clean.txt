2944: Manage vegetation along utility and service line corridors to increase foraging habitat for bats
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation along utility or service line corridors could be managed to increase foraging habitat for bats, e.g. by creating scalloped woodland or forest edges, planting a diverse mix of native plant species, retaining shrubs and low-growing trees, avoiding the use of chemicals, such as herbicides etc.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing vegetation along utility and service line corridors to increase forgaing habitat for bats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
