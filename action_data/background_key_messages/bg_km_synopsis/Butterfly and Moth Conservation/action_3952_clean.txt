3952: Remove tree canopy to reduce pond or waterway shading
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The edges of ponds and waterways provide open, sunny habitats favoured by many species, including both wetland specialists and more generalist butterflies and moths. However, management of tree growth along waterways may be necessary to prevent the habitat becoming enclosed, leading to increased shading and a loss of important habitat patches.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing tree canopy to reduce pond or waterway shading. This study was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
 
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA1 found that removing trees to reduce stream shading reduced the survival of Appalachian brown caterpillars and pupae, but did not affect egg survival.
