3886: Replant alternative host plants or disease resistant individuals to combat losses to disease 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Butterflies and moths rely on particular host plants for the growth and survival of their caterpillars, with some caterpillars able to feed on only one or two plant species. They are therefore vulnerable to sudden declines in the host plant population caused by disease. Planting alternative host plant species (where available) or disease resistant individuals of the affected plant species may help to buffer butterfly and moth populations against the threat of host plant disease.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of replanting alternative host plants or disease resistant individuals to combat losses to disease.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
