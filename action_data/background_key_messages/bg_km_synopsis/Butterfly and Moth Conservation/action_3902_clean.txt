3902: Use low intensity lighting 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Artificial lighting disrupts the activity of nocturnal moths, for example altering feeding behaviour (van Langevelde et al. 2017). Brighter, higher intensity lights are likely to be more attractive, or to disrupt individuals over a wider area as the light reaches further into the darkness. Reducing the intensity of lights used at night may help to minimize the impact on moths, while maintaining lighting for people in key areas (Gaston et al. 2012).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using low intensity lighting. This study was in Germany.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in Germany found that fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights (which also emitted a narrower range of yellow light with little UV) than to higher intensity lights (which also emitted broader spectra and included UV).
