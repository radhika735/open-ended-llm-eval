3863: Legally protect butterflies and moths 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Historically, the widespread collection of butterflies and moths by private collectors was a popular activity, and may have contributed to the decline of some rarer species (Collins & Morris 1985, Duffey 1968). Today, collecting is illegal in many parts of the world, and rarer species are often subject to specific legal protection. However, it should be noted that for understudied species, carefully regulated collection for scientific research can yield valuable insights into species’ diversity, ecology and conservation. This action is for studies testing the impact of legal protection on wild populations of butterflies and moths, either across all species, or using species-specific legislation.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of legally protecting butterflies and moths.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
