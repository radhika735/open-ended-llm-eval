3835: Protect or restore brownfield or ex-industrial sites 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Ex-industrial, or brownfield, sites can provide important early-successional habitat for a range of species, including butterflies and moths. However, such sites are often targeted for urban development (Robins et al. 2013) or fertilized and planted to accelerate succession (Tropek et al. 2010). Legal protection which prevents development may be required to retain such sites, and restoration which maintains a state of early succession may be important for rare and sensitive species (Tropek et al. 2010).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of protecting or restoring brownfield or ex-industrial sites on butterflies and moths.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
