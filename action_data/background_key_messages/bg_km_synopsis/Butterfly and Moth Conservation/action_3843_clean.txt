3843: Remove or change turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Wind turbines, like other large structures, are illuminated at night to alert aircraft to their presence. However, lighting attracts nocturnal moths, reducing their ability to forage as well as causing direct mortality (van Langevelde et al. 2017). The colour or type of lighting used also affects how attractive lights are to moths, with shorter wavelength light (ultraviolet, blue and green) being more attractive than longer wavelengths (red and yellow; van Langevelde et al. 2011). Removing or changing the lighting used on turbines may therefore reduce their impact on moth populations.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
