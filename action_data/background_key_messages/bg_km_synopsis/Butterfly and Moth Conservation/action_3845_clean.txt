3845: Reduce the size of surface features when prospecting for or extracting underground products 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Prospecting for underground products, such as oil and gas, can require the destruction of habitat on the surface. Minimizing the footprint of these operations may reduce the disturbance to sensitive species. Note that smaller individual disturbances may require more patches of disturbance across the landscape, and therefore may not reduce the total area disturbed (Riva et al. 2018).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of reducing the size of surface features when prospecting for or extracting underground products. This study was in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that narrow corridors used for prospecting for oil had a lower species richness of butterflies than wide corridors, but were similar to undisturbed forest.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that narrow corridors used for prospecting for oil had a lower abundance of butterflies than wide corridors, but were similar to undisturbed forest.
