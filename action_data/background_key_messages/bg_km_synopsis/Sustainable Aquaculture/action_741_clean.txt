741: Alter lighting
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial salmon farms are susceptible to outbreaks of sea lice. Traditionally, control of sea lice has involved pesticide use, either through oral administration or as a bath treatment. Light has been investigated as an alternative to pesticides as a control agent.

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled study in Norway reported lower numbers of lice on salmon kept in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting. The more intense the artificial light was, the higher the number of lice found on fish.
