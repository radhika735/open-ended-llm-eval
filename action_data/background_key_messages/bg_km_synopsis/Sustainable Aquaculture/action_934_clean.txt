Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

One controlled study in the Red Sea found no difference in sediment carbon at artificial reef sites adjacent to or away from fish farms. 
Another publication from the same controlled study reports that the artificial reefs at both sites were colonised with various species with the potential to remove organic compounds from fish farm effluents.
