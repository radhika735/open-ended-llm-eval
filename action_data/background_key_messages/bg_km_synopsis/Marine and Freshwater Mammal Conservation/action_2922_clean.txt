2922: Leave anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Anthropogenic structures on the sea floor, such as pipelines, cable routes, wind turbines and oil rigs, may form ‘artificial reefs’ as they are colonised by marine invertebrates and provide breeding grounds and shelter for fish. This may provide a foraging resource for predatory marine mammals, such as porpoises and seals (e.g. Dähne et al. 2014, Arnould et al. 2015). Leaving such structures in place after decommissioning may therefore be beneficial to some marine mammal species. However, artificial reefs may also act as ‘ecological traps’ for mammal prey, attracting species to less favourable habitats leading to a decrease in fitness (Russell et al. 2014).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of leaving anthropogenic structures in place after decommissioning on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
