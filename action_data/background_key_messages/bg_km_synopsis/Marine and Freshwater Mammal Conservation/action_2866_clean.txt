2866: Limit, cease or prohibit dumping of sewage sludge
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Sewage sludge is the residual, semi-solid material produced as a by-product during sewage treatment. Sewage sludge can be disposed of at sea or in rivers and may impact marine and freshwater mammals through the introduction of bacteria and viruses, heavy metals, and chemicals. Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the dumping of sewage sludge in an area may reduce the risk of contaminating marine and freshwater mammals and their habitats.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting dumping of sewage sludge on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
