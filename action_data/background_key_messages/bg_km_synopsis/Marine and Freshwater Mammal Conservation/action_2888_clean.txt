2888: Equip ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may become entangled in abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Equipping ports with dedicated fishing gear disposal facilities may encourage fishers to dispose of gear responsibly and may therefore reduce the risk of mammal entanglement.
