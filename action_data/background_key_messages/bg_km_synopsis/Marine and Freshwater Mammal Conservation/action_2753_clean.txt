2753: Use cooling towers instead of once-through cooling systems
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Once-through cooling systems use a process that involves pulling in cold water from rivers, lakes, or the ocean to cool power plant reactors. Marine or freshwater mammals may be drawn into the intake tunnels and become trapped resulting in injury or death. An alternative approach is to use cooling towers in which water is stored in large tanks and re-used.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using cooling towers instead of once-through cooling systems on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
