2825: Switch off artificial lighting at wild fisheries
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals, such as seals, may use artificial lighting to feed on fish at wild fisheries at night. Switching off lighting that shines onto the water may reduce mammal predation, thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict and the motivation to use lethal or harmful deterrents.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on freshwater mammals of switching off artificial lights at a wild fishery. The study was in the Puntledge River (Canada).
