2836: Promote fish and seafood certification (e.g. ecolabels) to reduce consumer demand for fisheries that threaten mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fish and seafood certification (e.g. ecolabels) may reduce consumer demand for fisheries that threaten marine and freshwater mammals. For example, ‘dolphin-safe’ ecolabels have been used widely on tuna products from fisheries that claim to use practices that reduce dolphin bycatch. However, the accuracy of such labels and the motivations for using them have been questioned, and greater regulation may be required (Ward 2008).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of promoting fish and seafood certification (e.g. ecolabels) to reduce consumer demand for fisheries that threaten mammals on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
