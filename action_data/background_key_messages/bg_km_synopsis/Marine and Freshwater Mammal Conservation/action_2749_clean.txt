2749: Use real-time automated tools at renewable energy sites to detect marine and freshwater mammals and allow operations to be stopped or modified
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Automated detection systems, e.g. using sonar or acoustic monitoring, may be used at renewable energy sites to detect the presence of marine or freshwater mammals and allow operations to be stopped or modified. This may reduce the risk of mammal injury or death caused by collisions with moving structures, such as underwater turbines.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using real-time automated tools at renewable energy sites to detect marine and freshwater mammals and allow operations to be stopped or modified.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
