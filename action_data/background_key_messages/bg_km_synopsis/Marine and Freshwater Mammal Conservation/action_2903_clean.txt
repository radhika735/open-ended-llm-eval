2903: Limit, cease or prohibit the use of underwater explosives
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Underwater explosives are used for military purposes (e.g. bomb disposal, training exercises) and for construction works or decommissioning. The detonation of explosives generates large amounts of sound energy and shock waves that may injure or kill marine and freshwater mammals (Ketten et al. 1993, Dolman & St. Leger 2011). Limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the use of underwater explosives may reduce the risk of harm to mammals.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting, ceasing or prohibiting the use of underwater explosives on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
