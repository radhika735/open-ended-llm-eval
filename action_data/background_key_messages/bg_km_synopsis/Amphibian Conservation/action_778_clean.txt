778: Use herbicides to control mid-storey or ground vegetation
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Herbicides can be used as a substitute for prescribed fire to eliminate competing mid-storey or ground vegetation. Although herbicides do not have the multiple ecosystem functions provided by fire, they have some advantages such as increased selectivity and decreased risk of offsite fire damage.
Other studies that control mid-storey or ground vegetation are discussed in ‘Mechanically remove mid-storey or ground vegetation’.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including two randomized, replicated, controlled studies) in the USA found that understory removal using herbicide had no effect or some negative effects on amphibian abundance.
One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that following logging American toad abundance was similar and wood frogs lower in stands with herbicide treatment and planting compared to stands left to regenerate naturally.
