779: Legal protection of species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Legal protection can be given to species on a national or international scale. Levels of protection vary for species and may include protection against killing, capturing, disturbing or trading, or damaging or destroying their breeding sites or resting places. Depending on the level of protection, activities such as development that are likely to affect protected species in these ways may be against the law and require licences from a government licensing authority.
Other studies that discuss legal protection of species are included in ‘Threat: Biological resource use – Use legislative regulation to protect wild populations’.
 

Key Messages:

Three reviews (including one systematic review) in the Netherlands and UK (Bosman et al. 2011, Spitzen-van der Sluijs et al. 2011, Lewis 2012) found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development.
Two reviews in the UK (Edgar et al. 2005, Lewis 2012) found that the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales.
