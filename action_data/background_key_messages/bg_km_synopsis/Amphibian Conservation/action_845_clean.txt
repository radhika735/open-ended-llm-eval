845: Leave standing deadwood/snags in forests
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Snags or standing dead trees and other dead wood can provide shelter for amphibians within forest. Retaining these within clearcut forest may help to maintain amphibian populations.
Studies investigating the effect of leaving coarse woody debris during harvest are discussed in ‘Leave course woody debris in forests’.
 

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to total clearcutting, leaving dead or wildlife trees did not result in higher abundances of salamanders. 
Two studies (including one randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study) in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not prevent a decrease in salamander abundance or change in species composition. 
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were similar with removal or creation of dead trees within forest. 
One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to unharvested plots, the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs, eggs per female or proportion of juveniles were similar or lower in harvested plots that included plots where dead and wildlife trees were left during clearcutting, depending on species and time since harvest.
