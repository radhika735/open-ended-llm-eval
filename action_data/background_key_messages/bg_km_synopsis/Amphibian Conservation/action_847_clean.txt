847: Use patch retention instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests exploited for timber. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effect of retaining patches of trees rather than clearcutting on amphibian populations.
One replicated study in Canada found that although released red-legged frogs did not show significant movement towards retained tree patches, large patches were selected more and moved out of less than small patches.
