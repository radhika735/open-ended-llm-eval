840: Restore habitat connectivity
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Habitat destruction and fragmentation are important factors in the decline of amphibian populations. Small patches of habitat support smaller populations and if individuals are unable to move to other suitable areas, populations become isolated. This can make them more vulnerable to extinction. Restoring corridors of native vegetation between patches of suitable habitat may help to maintain amphibian populations.
Studies investigating the effects of restoring habitat connectivity with wildlife tunnels are discussed in ‘Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Install culverts or tunnels as road crossings’.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Italy found that restoring connectivity between two wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct, significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians.
