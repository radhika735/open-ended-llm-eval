867: Create ponds for salamanders (including newts)
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
As there is a larger literature for great crested newts Triturus cristatus than other species, evidence is considered in a separate section.
 

Key Messages:

Three before-and-after studies (including two replicated studies) in France, Germany and the USA found that naturally colonizing alpine newts, captive-bred smooth newts or translocated spotted salamanders established stable breeding populations in 20–100% of created ponds.
Two replicated, before-and-after study in France and China found that alpine newts or Chinhai salamanders reproduced in 60–100% of created ponds. One small, replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that translocated spotted salamanders but not tiger salamanders reproduced in created ponds.
