807: Provide shelter habitat
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Planting trees or scrub can act as a windbreak and create a warm microclimate around breeding sites. Alternatively, management such as increasing tree canopies can help to provide shade from the sun to reduce temperatures where they become too high.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of providing shelter habitat on amphibian populations.
