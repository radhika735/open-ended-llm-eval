790: Maintain or restore hedges
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Hedgerows can provide valuable migration corridors for wildlife, particularly in disturbed landscapes. For example, newts migrating away from breeding ponds were found to use hedgerows more than expected within a pastoral landscape (Jehle & Arntzen 2000).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of maintaining or restoring of hedges on amphibian populations.
