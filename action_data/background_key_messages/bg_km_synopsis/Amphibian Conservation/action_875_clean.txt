875: Release captive-bred toads
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
As there is a larger literature for Mallorcan midwife toads Alytes muletensis than other species, evidence is considered in a separate section. 
 

Key Messages:

Two of three studies (including two replicated studies) in Denmark, Sweden and the USA found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, in one case at 70% of sites. One of the studies found that populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads.
Two studies in Puerto Rico found that survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low and that 25% were predated within two days of release.
