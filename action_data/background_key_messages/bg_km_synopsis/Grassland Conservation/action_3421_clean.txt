3421: Add woody debris to protect seeds/plants
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
In natural grasslands, the survival and growth of some plant species may be positively influenced by another plant species as a result of protection from drought or from grazing (Brooker et al. 2008). This observation has led to the use of nurse plants – where the seeds of plants are sown underneath other existing plants in the hope that this will improve their chances of establishment. Adding woody debris for protection is a modification of this idea, where woody debris is added to increase the likelihood that plants sown underneath the debris will survive.
