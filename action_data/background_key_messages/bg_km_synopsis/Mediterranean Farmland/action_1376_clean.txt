Organic matter (0 studies)
Nutrients (2 studies): One controlled study in wood pasture in Chile found more nitrogen and phosphorus in paddocks grazed at lower intensities, in some comparisons. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USAÂ found no difference in nitrogen between areas with low or high levels of simulated grazing.
Soil organisms (0 studies)
Soil erosion and aggregation (0 studies)
Greenhouse gases (1 study): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in grasslands in the USA found no differences in rates of soil respiration between areas with low or high levels of simulated grazing.
