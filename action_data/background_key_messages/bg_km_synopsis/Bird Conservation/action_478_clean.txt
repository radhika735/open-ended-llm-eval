478: Provide artificial nesting sites for divers/loons
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Divers or loons (Gaviidae) are specialised for swimming and diving and cannot move quickly on land. This means they are vulnerable to predators and frequently nest on small islands and patches of vegetation. Providing these habitats where they are absent may increase the number of birds using a site, increase their reproductive success, or allow the colonisation of new lakes.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated before-and-after study from the UK found that there was a very large increase in loon productivity on lakes provided with nesting rafts, with a corresponding increase in productivity across the whole country.
Two studies from the USA found higher nesting success on lakes with floating  nesting rafts, compared to sites without rafts, but no new territories were established on lakes without loons but with rafts.
A replicated study from the UK found that loons used nesting rafts and artificial islands in some areas of the UK, but not others.
