Background information and definitions:
Buoys may interfere with birds landing on the water and attempting to take baits in a similar way to streamer lines interfering with birds flying behind boats.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects on seabird bycatch rates of towing buoys behind longlining boats.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches.
