366: Restore or create inland wetlands 
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This section includes studies describing the effects of wetland restoration or creation for all wetlands which are not coastal, or do not receive regular influxes of salt water.
 

Key Messages:

Of eleven studies captured, 11, from the mainland USA, Guam, Canada and Hawaii, found that birds used artificially restored or created wetlands. Two found that rates of use and species richness were similar or higher than on natural wetlands. One found that use rates were higher than on unrestored wetlands.
Three studies from the USA and Puerto Rico found that restored wetlands held lower densities and fewer species of birds than natural wetlands.
A replicated study from the USA found that least bittern productivity was similar in restored and natural wetlands.
Two replicated studies examined wetland characteristics: one from the USA found that semi-permanent restored wetlands were used more than temporary or seasonal ones. A study from Hawaii found that larger restored wetlands were used more than smaller sites.
