364: Restore or create shrubland 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Shrublands are extremely diverse habitats, being found from subantarctic regions, through temperate climates to tropical dry and moist shrublands such as karoo (in South Africa) and restingas (in Brazil). They are also found from sea level up to beyond the tree line in mountains. However, we found relatively few studies describing the effects of shrubland restoration on bird populations, so we have not subdivided the studies further.
 

Key Messages:

Only one of the four studies captured investigated the effects of shrubland restoration in isolation. This small before-and-after study from the UK found that one or two pairs of northern lapwing bred on an area of restored moorland, whereas none had previously bred in the area.
A study from the USA and one from the Azores found that populations of target species (gamebirds and seabirds) increased following shrubland restoration, amongst other interventions.
A replicated study from the UK which did not distinguish between several interventions performed found a negative relationship between the combined intervention and the ratio of young-to-old grey partridges.
