443: Remove brood parasite eggs from target species’ nests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Brood parasites will only have detrimental impacts on host species if their chicks hatch in host nests. Therefore, removing parasite eggs from host nests before they hatch may protect host populations.
 

Key Messages:

A controlled before-and-after study on Puerto Rico found lower rates of parasitism of yellow-shouldered blackbird Agelaius xanthomus nests when shiny cowbird Molothrus bonariensis eggs were removed from nests.
A replicated, controlled study from 1997-1999 in grassy fields in New York State, USA found that song sparrow Melospiza melodia nests that had cowbird eggs removed from them had lower success than nests which were parasitised and that did not have eggs removed.
