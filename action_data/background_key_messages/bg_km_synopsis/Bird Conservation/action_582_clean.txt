582: Ensure translocated birds are familiar with each other before release
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Translocations are only going to be successful if birds breed after establishing themselves. This may be more likely to occur if birds are familiar with each other before release.
 

Key Messages:
Two controlled trials from New Zealand found no evidence that translocating birds which were familiar with each other was more likely to succeed than translocating unfamiliar birds.
