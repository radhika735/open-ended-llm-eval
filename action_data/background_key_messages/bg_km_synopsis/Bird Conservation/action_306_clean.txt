306: Reduce ‘ghost fishing’ by lost/discarded gear
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Abandoned fishing gear or gear that is lost at sea can continue catching fish, birds and other animals for years, or even decades, as the strong monofilament or steel nets slowly break up. Such gear has no commercial purpose and can damage fish stocks or even equipment as well killing birds. Reducing this ‘ghost fishing’ is therefore likely to benefit both wildlife and fishermen.
 

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects on seabird bycatch rates or populations of reducing ghost fishing.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
