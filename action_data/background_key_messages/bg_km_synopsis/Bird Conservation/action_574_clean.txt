574: Translocate raptors
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raptor populations across the world have been lost to persecution, pollution (e.g. DDT contamination) and other threats, and have therefore been subject to many reintroduction programmes, using both captive-bred (see ‘Release of captive-bred individuals’) and wild-bred individuals. These programmes can be controversial as large birds of prey can take livestock, but also have the potential to restore ‘flagship’ species and boost interest in conservation.
 
 

Key Messages:

Six studies of three translocation programmes in the UK and the USA found that all three successfully established populations of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, red kites Milvus milvus and ospreys Pandion halieatus. However, the latest review of the programme to reintroduce red kites to England and Scotland reported that one of six populations was very small, with only four pairs, despite 90 birds being released.
A replicated study in Spain found high survival and establishment of translocated Montagu’s harrier Circus pygargus fledglings.
