371: Remove or control predators to enhance bird populations and communities
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

A meta-analysis and a systematic review both found that reproductive success increased with predator removal, but their exact findings differed. 
The meta-analysis found that post-breeding population size increased, whilst the systematic review found that this was true on mainlands, but not islands and that breeding populations also increased.
