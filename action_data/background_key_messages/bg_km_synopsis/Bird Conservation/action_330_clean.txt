330: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In forests in which trees are commercially exploited for timber, a system known as patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clear-cut. Typically, around 10% of mature and/or immature trees are retained in patches within an otherwise, clear-cut harvest compartment, with ‘prompt reforestation’ subsequent to timber extraction in the other 90%. These retained patches could help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for re-colonisation by forest dependant species.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study of two from the USA found that areas under patch retention harvesting contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas, retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas.
Two studies from the USA found that forest specialist species were found with greater frequency in patch retention plots than other management types. One found that habitat generalists increased on other management types, relative to patch retention areas.
