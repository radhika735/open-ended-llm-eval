157: Distribute poison bait for predator control using dispensers 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If bait is easily visible, birds may be more likely to feed on it opportunistically. Therefore providing it in dispensers, which partially hide bait or make it difficult for non-target species to access it, may reduce incidental mortality of non-target species.

Key Messages:
A controlled study in New Zealand found that survival of South Island robins Petroica australis australis was higher when brodifacoum was dispensed from bait feeders compared to where bait was scattered.
