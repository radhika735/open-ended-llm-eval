430: Reduce adverse habitat alterations by excluding problematic aquatic species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many of the most destructive invasive species are aquatic, for example zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. Excluding such species has unique difficulties, but it may be possible to maintain small areas without them.
 
 

Key Messages:
A replicated paired study in the USA found that waterbirds preferentially used wetland plots from which grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were excluded but moved as these became depleted over the winter.
