299: Reduce seabird bycatch by releasing offal overboard when setting longlines 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many fishing boats prepare fish onboard, after catching them, in order to maximise the catch that can be stored. The offal (waste) is then normally discarded overboard. Moreno et al. 1996 describe the highest bycatch rates of a series of voyages coming from a vessel that piped offal overboard on the same side that the line was being set. However, other studies suggest that piping offal overboard from a different point to where the lines are being set will reduce bycatch, as birds spend their time eating the offal, rather than attempting to take bait.

Key Messages:
Two replicated and controlled studies in the South Atlantic and sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean found significant reductions in the number of albatross and petrels attacking baits and being caught when offal was released overboard during line setting.
