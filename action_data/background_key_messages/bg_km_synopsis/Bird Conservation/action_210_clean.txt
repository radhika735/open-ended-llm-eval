210: Revert arable land to permanent grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves changing from an arable crop to sown agricultural grassland, to be used for grazing or silage. It is not the same as the creation of species-rich or other semi-natural grasslands, which is discussed in the chapter on habitat restoration and creation.
See also ‘Provide or retain set-aside areas’ for some studies where non-rotational set-aside land was sown with grass, but managed as set-aside rather than as permanent agricultural grassland.
 

Key Messages:

All five studies looking at the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to birds. The studies monitored birds or grey partridges in the UK and wading birds in Denmark (4). They included three replicated controlled trials.
One of the studies, a controlled before-and-after study from the UK, showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland.
