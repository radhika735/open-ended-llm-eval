174: Reduce field size (or maintain small fields)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Reducing field size means having a greater number of smaller fields, with boundaries between them. One reason this approach is expected to enhance biodiversity is that field boundaries of any type provide heterogeneity, with heterogeneity thought to be a strong factor determining biodiversity on farmland.

Key Messages:

We found no intervention-based evidence on the effects of reducing field sizes on bird populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
