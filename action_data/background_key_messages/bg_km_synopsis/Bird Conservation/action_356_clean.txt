356: Use environmentally sensitive flood management 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many rivers across the world have been channelized and managed, meaning that then natural dynamics (changes in water levels, flooding etc) are lost. This has destroyed habitat and can also lead to less frequent, but far more damaging floods. Using environmentally sensitive flood management may both provide habitats and reduce the damage caused by flooding.
 

Key Messages:

One of two studies, a before-and-after study from the UK, found that there were significantly more bird territories in a stretch of river with ‘flood beams’ installed, compared to a channelized river.
A replicated site comparison study in the USA found that 13 of 20 bird species increased at sites with the restoration of river dynamics and vegetation.
