192: Use mowing techniques to reduce chick mortality
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
During mowing and harvesting operations, ground-nesting birds frequently remain in long grass or crops for as long as possible. If mowing/harvest occurs from the outside of the field inwards, this behaviour can leave the birds trapped in the centre of the field and killed as the last patch is harvested. Adjusting mowing techniques, for example starting from the inside of the field, can therefore allow chicks to escape into field margins.
 

Key Messages:

A review from the UK found a large increase in corncrake Crex crex populations in the UK following a scheme to delay mowing and promote corncrake-friendly mowing techniques.
One replicated controlled study from the UK and a review from the UK found lower levels of mortality of corncrakes and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis when wildlife-friendly mowing techniques were used, compared to other techniques.
