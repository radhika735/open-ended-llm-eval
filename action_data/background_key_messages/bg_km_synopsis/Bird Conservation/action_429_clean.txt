429: Reduce adverse habitat alterations by excluding problematic terrestrial species
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
One possible response to problematic, habitat-altering species is to create exclusion areas, allowing natural habitats to regenerate away from the problematic species.
Â 

Key Messages:

Three studies from the USA and the UK found higher numbers of certain songbird species and a higher species richness in these groups when deer were excluded from forests. Intermediate canopy-nesting species in the USA and common nightingales Luscinia macrorhynchos in the UK were the species to benefit.
A study from Hawaii found mixed effects of grazer exclusion, with some species showing population increases, some declines and other different long- and short-term trends.
