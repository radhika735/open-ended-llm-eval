556: Use perches to increase foraging success
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If prey are plentiful but birds have low hunting success then it may be possible to increase population sizes by making hunting more effective, for example by providing perches for birds to use.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from the USA found that raptors and other birds used perches provided, whilst a replicated and controlled study in Sweden found that raptors used clearcuts with perches significantly more than those without.
However, a controlled study from the USA found that overall bird abundances were not higher in areas provided with perches and a small controlled cross-over trial on an island in the USA found that San Clemente loggerhead shrikes Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi did not alter their hunting patterns or increase their success rates following the installation of perches in their territories.
