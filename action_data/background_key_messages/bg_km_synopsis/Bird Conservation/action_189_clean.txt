189: Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips for birds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Flowering plants are sown in strips or blocks, for bees and other flower-visiting insects. Nectar flower mixture can include agricultural varieties of flowering plants such as clovers. Increased numbers of insects may then provide food for more birds.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled studies from the UK (one randomised) and a European review out of seven studies captured found that more birds used nectar/wildflower strips than crops or land under other management. Two studies of a replicated and controlled experiment in the UK found that no more birds used nectar/wildflower strips in winter than used land under other management.
A replicated, controlled study from Switzerland found that Eurasian skylarks Alauda arvensis were more likely to nest in patches of fields sown with annual weeds than in crops, and were less likely to abandon nests in these patches.
A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that field margin management affected their use by birds more than the seed mix used on them.
