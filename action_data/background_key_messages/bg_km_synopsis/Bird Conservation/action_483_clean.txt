483: Provide artificial nesting sites for wildfowl using artificial/floating islands
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Some species of wildfowl nest on the ground and so as well as providing nest boxes (see separate intervention), conservationists may be able to increase the survival of wildfowl broods by providing artificial island or floating rafts in water bodies.
 

Key Messages:

Two studies from North America found that a variety of wildfowl used artificial islands and floating rafts, and had high (70–80%) nesting success.
A replicated study from across the UK found that wildfowl preferentially nested on well vegetated islands, compared to bare ones.
