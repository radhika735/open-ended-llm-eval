295: Use a sonic scarer when setting longlines to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
It might be possible to stop birds from taking baits from longlines by scaring them away from boats using loud noises.
 

Key Messages:
A single study from the South Atlantic found that seabird bycatch rates did not appear to be lower on longlines set with a sonic scarer, and that changes in seabird behaviour due to the scarer were only temporary.
