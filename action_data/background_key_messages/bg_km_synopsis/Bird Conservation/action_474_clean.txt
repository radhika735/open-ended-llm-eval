474: Replace nesting substrate following severe weather
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Many birds require specific substrates to nest on, and if flooding or heavy rains remove these then they may not nest. Replacing the substrate following removal may therefore help a colony to survive. Most studies describing the reconstruction of nesting habitats or the protection of nests from flooding are described in ‘Provide artificial nesting sites’.
 
 

Key Messages:
Two before-and-after studies from Canada found that common tern Sterna hirundo populations increased at one colony where nesting substrates were replaced, but decreased at a second. Several other interventions were used at both sites, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of substrate replacement.
