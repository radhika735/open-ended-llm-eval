382: Control mammalian predators on islands for songbirds
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after trials in the Seychelles and Cook Islands describe population increases in magpie robins and monarch flycatchers following cat and rat control. A before-and-after study from New Zealand found that the population of South Island robins Petroica australis australis was almost identical before and after rat control.
Two studies found higher reproductive success in monarch flycatchers and shrikes in areas with rodent control, compared to areas without control. However, this was climate dependent in shrikes. 
A before-and-after study from Hawaii found lower predation on artificial nests after intensive rodent control.
