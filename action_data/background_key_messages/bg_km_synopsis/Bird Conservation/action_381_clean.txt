381: Control mammalian predators on islands for parrots
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The kakapo Strigops habroptila is a large, flightless parrot, once common across New Zealand but almost wiped out by the late 20th century due to predation of adults by feral cats Felis catus, dogs Canis familiaris and mustelids and the loss of eggs and chicks to rats Rattus spp. Starting in the 1970s, the remaining birds were translocated to islands free from cats and populations were very intensively managed (see ‘General responses to small and declining populations’).
The Kermadec red-crowned parakeet Cyanoramphus movazelandiae, also from New Zealand was the first parrot to recolonise an island after predator removal.
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:
Two before-and-after studies in New Zealand found reduced nest predation and successful recolonisation of an island following invasive mammal eradication or control.
