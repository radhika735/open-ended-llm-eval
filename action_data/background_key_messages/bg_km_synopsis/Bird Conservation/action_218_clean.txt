218: Maintain species-rich, semi-natural grassland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Low-intensity management of grasslands has produced some of the most species-rich habitats in Europe and there are several agri-environment schemes designed to maintain these grassland. Such schemes may include several different interventions, attempting to replicate traditional management.
 

Key Messages:

A before-and-after study from the UK found five species of conservation concern increased after the implementation of management designed to maintain unimproved grasslands. 
A replicated study from Switzerland found that wetland birds appeared to preferentially choose managed hay meadows; birds of open farmland avoided it.
