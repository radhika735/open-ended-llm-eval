269: Use perch-deterrents to stop raptors perching on pylons
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Preventing raptors from landing on pylons at all may reduce electrocution, for example, perch-deterrent power lines have spikes and pole caps on the pylons to deter birds.
 
 

Key Messages:
A single controlled study from the USA found significantly lower raptor activity close to perch-deterrent power lines, compared to control lines. No data were provided on electrocution rates.
