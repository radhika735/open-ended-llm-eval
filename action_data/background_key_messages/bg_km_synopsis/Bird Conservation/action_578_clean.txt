578: Translocate parrots
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Kakapos Strigops habroptila are large, flightless parrots that used to be found across New Zealand, but declined catastrophically after the introduction of mammalian predators. The entire population has now been transferred to predator-free islands off the mainland in an attempt to save the species.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies of two translocation programmes from the Pacific and New Zealand found that populations of parrots were successfully established on islands following translocations, including the colonisation of other islands in the New Zealand study.
Survival of translocated birds was monitored in five studies of four programmes from across the world and ranged from 41% over 60 days for red-fronted parakeets Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae in New Zealand to 98% for kakapos Strigops habroptila in New Zealand.
Survival for translocated thick-billed parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha in the USA was higher than for captive-bred birds.
Despite very high survival, kakapos that were translocated had very low reproductive output in New Zealand.
