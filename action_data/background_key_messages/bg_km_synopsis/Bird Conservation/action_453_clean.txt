453: Use repellents to deter birds from landing on pools polluted by mining
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If the threat from pollution is not from birds landing on ponds but from consuming the water, then repellents may be a more effective or inexpensive method of reducing harm.
 

Key Messages:
A randomised, replicated and controlled ex situ trial from the USA found that fewer common starlings Sturnus vulgaris consumed contaminated water when it was treated with repellents, compared to untreated water.
