257: Deter birds from landing on shellfish culture gear by suspending oyster bags under water
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Oyster bags are mesh bags, attached to floats and anchored on the seabed into which young ‘seed’ oysters are placed. They then grow and are harvested when large enough. Oyster cages are similar, but are made of rigid wire mesh.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated and controlled study from Canada found that significantly fewer birds roosted on oyster bags suspended 6 cm below the water, compared with non-submerged bags. Birds roosted on bags suspended 3 cm below the water as frequently as control bags.
