438: Remove ectoparasites from nests to increase survival or reproductive success 
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Nestlings are more vulnerable than adults to parasites, so reducing parasite burdens in nests may have a larger impact on reproductive success than treating adults.
 

Key Messages:

Six of the seven studies that investigated infestation rates found lower rates in nests treated for ectoparasites, one (that used microwaves to treat nests) did not find fewer parasites. 
Two studies from the USA found higher survival or lower abandonment in nests treated for ectoparasites, whilst seven studies from across the world found no differences in survival, fledging rates or productivity between nests treated for ectoparasites and controls.
Two studies from the USA and the UK found that chicks from nests treated for ectoparasites were in better condition than those from control nests. Four studies found no such effect.
