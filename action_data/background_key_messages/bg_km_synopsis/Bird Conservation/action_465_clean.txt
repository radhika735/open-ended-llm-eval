465: Use lime to reduce acidification in lakes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Acid rain, caused by airborne pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can acidify lakes and reduce the number of fish they hold. Adding lime (calcium and magnesium-rich minerals) to lakes can help reduce acidity.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study from Sweden found no difference in osprey Pandion haliaetus productivity during a period of extensive liming of acidified lakes compared to two periods without liming.
