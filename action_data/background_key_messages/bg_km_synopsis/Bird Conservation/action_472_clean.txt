472: Use volunteers to collect downed birds and rehabilitate them
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
A lot of the mortality caused by birds crashing into lights is not direct collision mortality, but caused by stunned and injured birds being predated (e.g. by gulls after crashing onto oil rigs, van de Laar 2007) or dying of dehydration. If volunteers or conservationists can collect downed birds soon after they crash and rehabilitate them, they may be able to greatly reduce collision mortality.
