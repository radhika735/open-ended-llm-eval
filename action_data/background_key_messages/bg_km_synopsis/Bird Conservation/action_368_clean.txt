368: Restore or create kelp forests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Kelp forests are unique habitats found in mostly cold, nutrient-rich waters. Large kelps such as Macrocystis spp. (the ‘giant kelps’) can grow to 45 m or more, creating ‘underwater forests’ that provide complex habitats and allow extremely productive ecosystems to flourish. However, they are vulnerable to pollution and ecosystem perturbations caused by, for example, the loss of keystone species such as sea otters Enhydra lutris (Jackson et al. 2001).

Key Messages:
A before-and-study in the USA found that the densities of five of the nine bird species analysed increased following kelp forest restoration.
