444: Use false brood parasite eggs to discourage brood parasitism
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Brood parasites choose to lay eggs in nests that have not previously been parasitized, to minimise intra-specific competition. Therefore, placing false parasite eggs in nests may protect nests by discouraging parasites from laying.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled experiment in the USA found lower parasitism rates for red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus nests with false or real brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater eggs added to them.
