279: Introduce voluntary ‘maximum shoot distances’
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The probability of successfully killing a bird when shooting decreases with distance from the bird. If hunting is regulated by ‘bag limits’ (i.e. the number of birds individuals can harvest), then shooting at birds from a long distance may be detrimental, as many birds are hit but do not die instantly. These escape and die later but are not collected and so are not included in a bag limit. This means that actual mortality from hunting is considerably higher than the set bag limits.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, randomised before-and-after study from Denmark found that significantly fewer pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus were wounded but not killed, following the implementation of a voluntary maximum shooting distance.
