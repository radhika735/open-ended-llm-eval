2588: Establish populations isolated from disease
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
When mammal populations are threatened by disease, a short- to medium-term management option may be to establish wild-living or captive populations that are isolated from sources of the disease, such as on islands or in large fenced enclosures (e.g. Jones et al. 2007). These could aid persistence of the species and provide stock for reintroductions, should the disease be eliminated or sufficiently controlled in the originally affected areas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of establishing populations isolated from disease. The study was in sub-Saharan Africa.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Condition (1 study): A site comparison study throughout sub-Saharan Africa found that fencing reduced prevalence of canine distemper but not of rabies, coronavirus or canine parvovirus in African wild dogs.
