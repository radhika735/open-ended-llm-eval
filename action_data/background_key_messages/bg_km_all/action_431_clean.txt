431: Control or remove habitat-altering mammals 
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
On continents and large islands, the chances of eradicating problematic species is very low, but we have captured five studies that describe the effects of successfully eradicating habitat-altering invasive species, most commonly European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus from small islands across the world. Such control efforts are often accompanied by attempts to restore native vegetation and habitats, described in ‘Habitat restoration and creation’.
 
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from the Azores and Australia found that seabird populations increased following the eradication of European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus or other species, although in three studies there were several other interventions used as well.
Two studies from Australia and the Madeira archipelago, Portugal, found that seabird populations’ productivities increased following rabbit and house mouse Mus musculus eradications, with several other interventions used in the Australian study.
