1338: Primates: Change feeding times
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Anticipating the arrival of food can lead to stress behaviours in captive animals. Changing the times when feeds are given to captive primates throughout the day reduces the predictability of feeds with the aim of increasing the amount of time animals spend foraging for foods by decreasing stress behaviours.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that when chimpanzees were fed on unpredictable schedules inactivity decreased.
