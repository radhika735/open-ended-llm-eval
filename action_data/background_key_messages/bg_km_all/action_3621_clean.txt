3621: Establish handling and release procedures for accidentally captured or entangled (‘bycatch’) reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Establishing and implementing best practice protocols for handling and releasing aquatic reptiles entangled or captured in fishing gear may reduce the risk of injury and improve post-release survival. This may involve releasing reptiles with or without delay, using appropriate techniques to remove fishing gear from entangled or hooked reptiles, and using appropriate procedures to release reptiles caught in nets.
For studies on the effect of releasing rehabilitated or accidentally captured (‘bycatch’) reptiles see Species management – Rehabilitate and release injured or accidentally caught individuals.
