843: Leave coarse woody debris in forests
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Coarse woody debris consists of fallen dead trees and cut branches (&gt; 10 cm diameter) that are left during harvesting. Coarse woody debris increases the structural diversity at the forest floor and provides a valuable microhabitat for animals that are moisture and temperature sensitive such as amphibians.
Studies investigating the effect of adding woody debris to forests are discussed in ‘Habitat restoration and creation – Create refuges’.
 

Key Messages:

Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that there was no significant difference in abundance in clearcuts with woody debris retained or removed for eight of nine amphibian species, but that the overall response (population, physiological and behavioural) of amphibians was more negative where woody debris was retained.
Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that the removal of coarse woody debris from standing forest did not decrease amphibian diversity or overall amphibian abundance, but did reduce species richness in one study.
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed.
One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas, and was similar in wood piles to unharvested forest.
