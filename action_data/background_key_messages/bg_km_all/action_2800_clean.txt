Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Bindings may be used to keep trawl nets closed until they have sunk below the water surface. This may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using bindings to keep trawl nets closed until they have sunk below the water surface on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
