222: Raise mowing height on grasslands to benefit birds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation height is important in determining the value of a grassland to wildlife. High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, but short vegetation can allow birds access to the ground which can help foraging, and can reduce the risk of predation (see Provide short grass for waders).
 

Key Messages:

A review from the UK  found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population.
A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass.
