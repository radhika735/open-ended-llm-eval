Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Positive human-animal relationships are discussed as a form of enrichment for captive animals. Using food as positive reinforcer for animal training is commonly used to help with veterinary and husbandry procedures. This form of training aims to reduce the potential stress experienced by an animal when in close proximity to humans (Claxton, 2011).
