621: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of cranes
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).
 

Key Messages:

Four studies of five release programmes from the USA and Russia, from a total of eight programmes, found that released cranes had high survival or bred in the wild. Two studies from two release programmes in the USA found low survival of captive-bred eggs fostered to wild birds, compared with wild eggs, or a failure to increase the wild flock size.
A worldwide review found that releases of migratory species only tended to be successful if birds were released into existing flocks, with higher success for non-migratory populations.
One study from the USA found that birds released as sub-adults had higher survival than birds cross-fostered to wild birds.
One study from the USA found that 73% of all mortalities occurred in the first year after release.
