1448: Strategically lay out the scent of a primate predator (e.g. leopard, lion)
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Predator scent, which is collected from animals in game farms, zoos and preserves and sold commercially, can be used to strategically lay out predator scent around agricultural fields in an attempt to deter primates from crop raiding. There is some evidence that these techniques can be effective against the more timid animals, but bolder crop raiders appear not to be put off (Sillero-Zubiri & Switzer 2001).

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of strategically laying out scent of predators to deter crop-raiding primates on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
