2377: Provide or retain set-aside areas on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Allocation of some farmland to set-aside (fields taken out of production) was compulsory under European Union agricultural policy from 1992 until 2008. The idea was to reduce production. However, set-aside has also been promoted as a method of enhancing biodiversity on farmland. Set-aside can be rotational (in a different place every year or two) or non-rotational (same place for 5â€“20 years) and fields can either be sown with fallow crops or left to naturally regenerate. Unlike fallow land, set-aside is not ploughed or harrowed except for the purpose of sowing. However, set-aside often is managed by cutting and/or spraying. In some cases, set-aside land has had wild flowers sown on it. Evidence for the effects of this management has been included under the intervention, Establish wild flower areas on farmland.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects on mammals of providing or retaining set-aside areas on farmland. Three studies were in the UK and one was in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Three replicated studies (including two site comparison studies), in the UK and Switzerland, found that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland, or brown hare numbers relative to numbers on farms without set-aside areas.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A before-and-after study in the UK found that use of uncut set-aside areas by wood mice increased after crop harvesting.
