1243: Plant a mixture of tree species to enhance diversity
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Direct planting of new trees can be used to restore degraded tree communities. This can also affect the abundance of other plant species and consequently the composition of the whole forest.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in Brazil found that planting various tree species increased species richness, but had no effect on the density of new trees.
One replicated, controlled study in Greece found that planting native tree species increased total plant species richness, diversity and cover.
