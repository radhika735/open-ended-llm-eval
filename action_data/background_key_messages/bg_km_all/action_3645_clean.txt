3645: Use nest covers to protect against human disturbance
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Human recreational activity may cause damage to reptile nests. Cage covers over individual nests may be used to prevent damage in areas of high human traffic.
For studies that discuss the use of nest covers to protect against predation, see Threat: Invasive and other problematic species â€“ Remove or control predators using fencing and/or aerial nets.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using nest covers to protect against human disturbance on reptiles. One study was in the USA and one was in Greece.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (including one paired study) in the USA and Greece found that loggerhead turtle nests that were covered with cages had similar hatching success compared to nests that were not covered. The other study found mixed effects of cages on hatching success of loggerhead turtle nests.
