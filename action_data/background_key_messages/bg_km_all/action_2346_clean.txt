2346: Prevent mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Background
Some mammals will utilize food, denning sites or other resources in human modified environments in such ways that risks them being regarded as exhibiting nuisance behaviour. Such behaviour might include damaging property, creating mess, causing noise disturbance or posing a perceived threat to humans. If mammals can be excluded from such situations, such as through electric fencing, this may reduce human-wildlife conflict and might, thus, reduce motivations for carrying out lethal control of such animals.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of preventing mammals accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites to reduce nuisance behaviour and human-wildlife conflict. One study was in the USA and one was in Switzerland.

Human-wildlife conflict (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in the USA found that electric shock devices prevented American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders. A before-and-after study in Switzerland found that electric fencing excluded stone martens from a building.
