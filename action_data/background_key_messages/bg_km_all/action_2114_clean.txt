2114: Purchase fishing permits and/or vessels from fishers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through species removal or habitat damage from fishing gear coming into contact with the seabed (Collie et al. 2000). Schemes can be set up where fishing permits and/or vessels are purchased from fishers. This can reduce fishing effort in an area due to fewer fishing boats operating (Gleason et al. 2013), thereby potentially reducing the impact on the seabed, the amount of unwanted catch, and overall threat to subtidal benthic invertebrates.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of purchasing fishing permits and/or vessels from fishers on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
