298: Thaw bait before setting lines to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Thawed bait sinks more quickly than frozen bait and so using it may reduce the time that bait is available to birds and therefore reduce bycatch.
 

Key Messages:
A single study from Australia found that lines set using thawed baits caught significantly fewer seabirds than controls.
