2085: Leave utility and service lines in place after decommissioning
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Utility and service lines can impact subtidal benthic invertebrates through physical damage and habitat loss. Along with associated infrastructures (Brigitte et al. 2018), it may be possible to leave utility and service lines in place after decommissioning (Ekins et al. 2006). This may avoid the threats associated with disturbance and physical damage from the removal of these structures. Evidence related to the potential benefits of removing pipelines in places are summarised under “Threat: Transportation and service corridors – Remove utility and service lines after decommissioning”. Evidence related to promoting biodiversity around subsea cables and pipelines are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Cover subsea cables with artificial reefs” and “Cover subsea cables with materials that encourage the accumulation of natural sediments”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of leaving utility and service lines in place after decommissioning on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
