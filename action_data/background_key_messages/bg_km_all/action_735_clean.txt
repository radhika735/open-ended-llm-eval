735: Breed for resistance traits 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Atlantic salmon cultured in commercial farms are at risk of contracting and transferring infectious bacterial diseases and other pathogens. Selective breeding aims to increase resistance against infectious diseases which may spread within the salmon farm, from wild salmon to cultured salmon and vice versa.

Key Messages:
  

A replicated, controlled study in Norway found increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when the family was bred for high resistance to the disease compared to a family bred for low resistance to the disease.
