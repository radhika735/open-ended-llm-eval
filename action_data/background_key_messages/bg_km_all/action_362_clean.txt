362: Manage the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:

Managing landscapes to enhance nectar and pollen resources for flower-visiting insects is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to enhance the agricultural pollination service and to conserve pollinator populations. It could involve increasing the diversity or area of flowering crops or conserving aspects of the landscape, such as flower-rich meadows, woodlands or river banks, which provide important floral resources.
In Europe, recent research has shown that higher coverage of the mass-flowering crop, oilseed rape Brassica napus, in the landscape is associated with higher numbers of foraging worker bumblebees Bombus spp. at focal sampling points, but not with enhanced bumblebee reproductive success or colony densities (Westphal et al. 2003, Herrmann et al. 2007, Westphal et al. 2009). This work is not summarized by Conservation Evidence because the evidence is correlative, the area of flowering crops was not increased as a conservation measure.

Key Messages:

One large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of ‘pollen and nectar’ agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square.
