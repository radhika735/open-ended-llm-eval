Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
When gravid female reptiles are killed, for example as a result of harvesting or as road collisions, it may be possible to collect eggs from carcasses for incubation in captivity.
Studies that discuss artificially incubating reptile eggs collected from wild-laid nests are included under Relocate nests/eggs for artificial incubation.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of recovering eggs from injured or dead reptiles on their populations. One study was in each of the USA and Columbia.
