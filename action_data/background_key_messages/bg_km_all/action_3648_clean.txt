3648: Reduce cumulative heating effects of urban development by planting vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Cumulative effects of urban development (the ‘urban heat island effect’) may affect reptile physiology because of the narrow thermal tolerances of many species. Native vegetation plantings, green roofs and shade may allow for urban reptiles to persist in heat-polluted areas (Ackley et al. 2015).
Ackley J.W., Angilletta Jr M.J., DeNardo D., Sullivan B. & Wu J. (2015) Urban heat island mitigation strategies and lizard thermal ecology: landscaping can quadruple potential activity time in an arid city. Urban Ecosystems, 18, 1447–59.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing the cumulative heating effects of urban development by planting vegetation on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
