378: Control mammalian predators on islands for waders
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:

A controlled before-and-after study in New Zealand found that the Chatham Island oystercatcher Haematopus chathamensis population increased following the removal of feral cats Felis catus and other species.
A second controlled before-and-after study in Alaska, USA, found small increases in black oystercatcher Haematopus bachmani breeding populations on two islands, but the overall population only increased on one, declining on the other.
