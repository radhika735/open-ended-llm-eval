3483: Remove invasive plant species to improve habitat within development footprints
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Greenfield, brownfield and urban areas are often invaded by weedy species. These potentially valuable habitat areas are subject to disturbances such as introduced exotic species (both plants and animals), fire and accumulation of rubbish. For studies relating to management of invasive plant species, see Threat: Invasive alien and other problematic species and Habitat restoration and creation.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of removing invasive plant species to improve habitat within development footprints.
