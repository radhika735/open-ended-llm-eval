2969: Exclude or remove livestock from historically grazed brackish/saline swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves completely excluding or completely removing livestock from marshes or swamps that have been negatively impacted by livestock grazing – whether deliberate or accidental. This may be implemented at a large scale (e.g. removing livestock from an entire farm) or at a small scale (e.g. tethering cattle to keep them off sensitive vegetation patches).
Domestic livestock can directly consume vegetation, destroy vegetation by trampling, create bare patches of ground (e.g. repeatedly used tracks), affect water infiltration and flows by compacting soils, affect nutrient balance through excretion of waste products, and import seeds of undesirable plants (Morris & Reich 2013). Removing livestock can allow grazing-sensitive species to recover. The effects might depend on site conditions such as productivity (determined by soil moisture and nutrient levels; Berney et al. 2014).
Related actions: Use barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed brackish/saline swamps; Reduce intensity of livestock grazing, without completely removing livestock; Use grazing to maintain or restore disturbance; Use grazing to control problematic plants; Exclude wild vertebrates; Modify livestock farming practices in watershed; Use fences or barriers to protect planted areas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of excluding or removing livestock from historically grazed brackish/saline swamps. The study was in South Africa and the focal livestock were cattle.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY
 
VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Individual species abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in South Africa reported that more grey mangrove Avicennia marina seedlings appeared in plots fenced to exclude cattle for two years, than in plots left open to cattle.

VEGETATION STRUCTURE

Height (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in South Africa reported that mangrove trees fenced off from cattle were taller, after two years, than trees accessible to cattle.

OTHER

Growth (1 study): One replicated, paired, controlled study in South Africa found that mangrove trees fenced off from cattle grew more over two years – in height, diameter and crown volume –than trees accessible to cattle.
