3543: Cease or prohibit all types of fishing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact reptile populations directly by species removal (both intentional and unintentional), or indirectly through removal of other species or by damaging habitats. Ceasing fishing activities in specific areas may allow time for populations of reptiles and the species they rely on (e.g. prey species) to recover.
For studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting particular types of fishing see Cease or prohibit commercial fishing and Limit or prohibit specific fishing methods.  For studies that investigate the effect of ceasing or prohibiting fishing at certain times see Establish temporary fishery closures.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of ceasing or prohibiting all types of fishing.
