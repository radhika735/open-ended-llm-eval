363: Restore or create traditional water meadows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Water meadows are areas of grazing land or hay meadow that have carefully controlled water levels to keep the soil damp. In Europe they provide valuable breeding habitats for waders and other biodiversity. The studies below describe instances when multiple interventions have been used to create water meadows. When the effects of multiple interventions, such as raising water levels and adding foot drains, can be separated, they are discussed under the relevant interventions in ‘Threat: Natural system modifications’.
 

Key Messages:

Four out of five before-and-after studies, all from the UK, found that the number of waders and wildfowl on sites increased following the restoration of water meadows. One before-and-after study from Sweden found no increase in northern lapwing population following an increase in the area of managed meadows in the study area. This study also found that restored meadows were used less than expected by breeding lapwings.
A before-and-after study from Sweden found that hatching success of northern lapwings were higher on meadows than on spring-sown crops. There were no differences between meadows and autumn-sown crops or grasslands.
