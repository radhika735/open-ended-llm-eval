859: Translocate natterjack toads
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
The natterjack toad Bufo calamita has declined, particularly in the UK where the species is now endangered. The decline is largely due to habitat destruction and the acidification of breeding sites. In Britain, attempts to reintroduce the species to sites where they had recently gone extinct started in the 1970s. 
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including one review) in France and the UK found that translocated natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles or adults established breeding populations at one site or in 30–70% of cases, some of which also released head-started or captive-bred animals or included habitat management. The review found that re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat was more successful than on heathland. One replicated study in the UK found that natterjack toad populations increased at sites established by translocations, particularly with replicated translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads.
Two replicated, before-and-after studies in Estonia and the UK found that translocating natterjack toad eggs or tadpoles resulted in breeding at 8–70% of sites, some of which had been restored.
