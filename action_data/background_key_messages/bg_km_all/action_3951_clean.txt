3951: Create scrapes and pools
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Access to water or damp environments is important for some species of butterfly and moth, including those where the adults gather nutrients by “mud-puddling”, or where caterpillars depend on hostplants which grow in damp conditions (Thomas & Lewington 2016). Creating small areas of temporary or permanent water, such as scrapes and pools, may benefit these species.
For studies on the creation of large, permanent wetlands, see “Restore or create wetlands and floodplains”. For studies on managing waterbodies to prevent desiccation, see “Climate change and severe weather – Manage natural waterbodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation”.
