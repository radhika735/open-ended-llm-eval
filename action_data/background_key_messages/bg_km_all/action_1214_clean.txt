1214: Use shelterwood harvest instead of clearcutting
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Shelterwood harvesting is a management technique designed to obtain even-aged trees without clearcutting. It involves harvesting trees in a series of partial cuts, with trees removed uniformly over the plot. This allows new seedlings to grow from seeds dispersed by older trees. This can help in maintaining distinctive forest species and increase structural diversity of stands.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated, controlled studies in Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity,  lower grass cover and higher  density of tree species compared with clearcutting.
