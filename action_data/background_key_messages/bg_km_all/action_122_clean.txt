122: Remove flood defence banks to allow inundation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:


Recent major flooding events have resulted in a change in European water management policies, from flood exclusion strategies to the use of former floodplains through reconnection with main rivers. This change will lead to an increase in flood frequency and may provide opportunities for the restoration of floodplain ecosystems.



Key Messages:

One controlled before-and-after study from the UK found more bird territories and species on a stretch of river modified to allow inundation of river edges compared to a channelized section of river.
One study from Belgium found that a combination of mowing and flooding resulted in increased plant species richness in meadow plots, but infrequently flooded, mown plots had more plant species than frequently flooded, non-mown plots.
