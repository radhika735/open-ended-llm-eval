3571: Use non-offset hooks
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The hook points on non-offset hooks lie along the same plane as the hook shaft, whereas the points on offset hooks are bent sideways and out of alignment with the hook shaft (usually within 25áµ’). As a result, offset hooks may be more likely to catch turtles in the mouth or on the body than non-off set hooks.
Studies in this action specifically test whether non-offset hooks are more, or less likely to catch sea turtles than offset hooks. For studies that compare using different types of circle hooks to different types of J-hooks, see: Use circle hooks instead of J-hooks.
See Use non-ringed hooks and Use larger hooks for studies that specifically test the effect of using these variations in hook design. See also See also Modify number of hooks between floats on longlines.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of using non-offset hooks on reptile populations. One study was off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and one was in the north-east Atlantic.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, controlled, paired study in the north-east Atlantic Ocean found that mortality of leatherback turtles was similar when caught with non-offset hooks or offset hooks.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (2 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (2 studies): One of two replicated, paired studies (including one controlled study) off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and in the north-east Atlantic found that non-offset circle hooks caught a similar number of olive ridley and green turtles compared to offset circle hooks in a shallow-set longline fishery. The other study found that non-offset G-style circle hooks caught fewer leatherback and hard-shell turtles compared to offset Gt-style circle hooks or offset J-hooks in a longline swordfish fishery.
