1634: Use grazing to control trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Livestock can damage and kill tree seedlings as a result of grazing and trampling. This can potentially be used to limit the growth and spread of problematic tree species in shrublands.

Key Messages:

One randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in ItalyÂ found that grazing to reduce tree cover reduced cover of common heather and the basal area of trees, but did not alter cover of purple moor grass.
