Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Â 

Key Messages:

A controlled, replicated, pilot experiment in 2010 in The Netherlands, found that flame treatments of 1, 2 or 3 seconds had a significantly negative and progressive impact on floating pennywort, and a 3 second repeat treatment after 11 days proved fatal.
