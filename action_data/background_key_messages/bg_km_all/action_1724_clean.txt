1724: Cut and use prescribed burning to control grass
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fire may damage or kill grasses therefore reducing competition with other shrubland plants. Mowing/cutting may further reduce grass cover allowing other shrubland vegetation to increase in abundance.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled, paired, before-and-after study in the UK found that burning and cutting to reduce the cover of purple moor grass reduced cover of common heather but did not reduce cover of purple moor grass.
