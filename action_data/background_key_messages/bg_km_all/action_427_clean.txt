427: Reduce competition between species by providing nest boxes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If several species are competing for nest sites then it might be possible to reduce this competition by providing a surplus of nesting sites. The more general effects of nest box provision are discussed in ‘General responses to small/declining populations’.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that providing extra nest boxes did not reduce the rate at which common starlings Sturnus vulgaris usurped northern flickers Colaptes auratus from nests.
