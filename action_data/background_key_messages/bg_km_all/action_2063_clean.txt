2063: Dispose of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Routine oil and gas drilling activities can impact subtidal invertebrate seabed communities due to the production of drill cuttings. Drill cuttings consist of the fragments of rock that are removed as each oil or gas well is drilled. The drill cuttings are usually discharged onto the seafloor in the vicinity of the platforms to form a cuttings pile, but are often contaminated with drilling fluids, oil and chemical additives which can leach and pollute the sediments. Drill cuttings can also smother and bury organisms under their weight (Henry et al. 2017). Disposing of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed (Melton et al. 2000; 2004), for instance following protective legislation or changes in activity management, can potentially stop the threat and allow for the community to recover over time. Evidence related to alternative means of disposing drill cuttings are summarised under “Threat: Energy production and mining - Bury drill cuttings in the seabed rather than leaving them on the seabed surface”, and those related to stopping their disposal under “Cease or prohibit the deposit of drill cuttings on the seabed”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of disposing of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
