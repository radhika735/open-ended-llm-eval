3593: Cease or prohibit the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Drill cuttings from oil and gas drilling activities are often discharged onto the sea floor or riverbed to form a cuttings pile. Drill cuttings consist of fragments of rock contaminated with drilling fluids, oil, and chemicals, which may have adverse impacts on aquatic and semi-aquatic reptiles. Ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers may reduce pollution and potential harm to reptiles.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on reptile populations of ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
