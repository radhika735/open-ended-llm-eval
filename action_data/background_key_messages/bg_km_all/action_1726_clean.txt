1726: Use ‘bracken bruiser’ to control bracken
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Bracken bruisers are lightweight rollers that can be pulled behind a tractor or other vehicle. They aim to crush and damage bracken, thereby limiting its growth.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after, paired study in the UK found that bracken bruising increased bracken cover, though bracken cover also increased in areas where bracken bruising was not done.There was no effect on the number of plant species or plant diversity.
