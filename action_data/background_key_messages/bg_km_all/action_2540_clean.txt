2540: Leave headlands in fields unsprayed
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Conservation headland management may involve restricting fertiliser, herbicide and insecticide spraying along a strip through a sown arable crop. Typically, as under agri-environment schemes practiced in Europe, this may be a 6-m-wide strip with selected herbicide applications permitted to control certain weeds or invasive species.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of leaving headlands in fields unsprayed. One study was in the UK and one was in the Netherlands.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
BEHAVIOUR (2 STUDIES)

Use (2 studies): Two replicated studies (one also controlled) in the UK and the Netherlands, found that crop edge headlands that were not sprayed with pesticides were used more by mice than were sprayed crop edges.
