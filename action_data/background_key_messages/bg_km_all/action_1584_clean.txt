1584: Plant indigenous trees to re-establish natural tree communities in clear-cut areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves the planting of indigenous trees to re-establish natural tree communities after clear-cutting. It should be noted, however, that planting trees will almost always be more expensive than preserving natural forests from clear-cutting and that natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests (which is not to say that primates cannot survive in young regrowth forest). In addition, it can take centuries and even millennia for the forest to regrow to its pre-disturbance state. For example, an Atlantic rainforest needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of animal-dispersed species (80% of the species), the proportion of non-pioneer species (90%) and of understorey species (50%) found in mature forests. On the other hand, much more time is necessary (between one and four thousand years) to reach the endemism levels (40% of the species) that exist in mature forests (Liebsch et al. 2008). Therefore, this intervention should only be considered if the natural habitat is already lost or if preserving it will not be possible.

Key Messages:

One site comparison study in Kenya found that two out of three primate species had lower group densities in planted forests than in natural forests.
