2679: Allow periodic fishing only
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Allowing fishing activity in an area only for limited frequencies and durations (called periodically harvested closures) is a spatial fisheries management strategy to reduce the impacts of overfishing. They are generally locally managed, small fisheries closures that range from being mostly closed, to mostly open to fishing and are widely implemented in Indo-Pacific regions (Goetze 2016). The aims of periodically harvested closures range from conservation of biodiversity to providing benefits to fisheries through increased catches and fish productivity. Their effectiveness at increasing fish productivity may depend on their size, duration of closure and level of compliance (Goetze 2016).

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of allowing fishing only periodically in an area on marine fish populations. The study was in the Coral Sea (Vanuatu).

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Coral Sea found that protected areas fished only for short periods over an 18 month to six-year period, had greater biomass than openly fished areas and similar fish biomass as areas permanently closed to fishing for six years.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (1 STUDY)

Catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Coral Sea found that protected areas only fished for short periods over an 18 month to six year period, had higher fish catch rates than openly fished areas.
