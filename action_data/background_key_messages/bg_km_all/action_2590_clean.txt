2590: Install barrier fencing along railways
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Collisions with trains can cause substantial numbers of mammal deaths (e.g. Gundersen & Andreassen 1998). Barrier fencing alongside railways may reduce access to railway tracks by mammals and, thus, reduce the number of mammal-train collisions.
