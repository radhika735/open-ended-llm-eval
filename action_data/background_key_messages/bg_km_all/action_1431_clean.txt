1431: Plant nesting trees/shelter for primates within agricultural fields
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many primate species display extraordinary behavioural flexibility, which allows them to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions and persist in moderately disturbed environments. For example, in Sierra Leone, small-scale subsistence farming allows areas of fallow land and secondary forest to remain where chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus can find food and shelter (Brncic et al. 2010). Therefore, planting sufficient amounts of nesting trees and/or shelter for primates within agricultural lands may promote primate conservation in these areas.
            The maintenance/protection of trees to provide nest sites and shelter for primates within agricultural fields is discussed under ‘Retain nesting trees/shelter for primates within agricultural fields’. The creation/maintenance of natural habitat islands within agricultural land is discussed under ‘Create natural habitat islands within agricultural land’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of planting nesting trees/shelter for primates within agricultural fields on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
