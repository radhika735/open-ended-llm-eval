2812: Involve stakeholders in allocation of harvest rights
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Harvest rights can be used to allocate fishing licences or quotas to individuals or entities. Using this system can ensure that fish stocks are not overexploited. Involving fishers and other stakeholders in the allocation process may reduce conflict and encourage compliance by users of the marine fish resource (Smith et al. 2019).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of involving stakeholders in the allocation of harvest rights on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
