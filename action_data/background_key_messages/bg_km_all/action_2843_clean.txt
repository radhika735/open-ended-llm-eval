2843: Inform the public of ways to reduce disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals (e.g. use educational signs)
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves providing information to the public, e.g. in the form of educational signs, with the aim of reducing disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals during recreational activities. This may be particularly beneficial at tourist sites that receive a high number of visitors, or in areas that are popular for watersports. Information may include guidance on approach distances, how to safely operate vessels around mammals, and instructions not to touch, feed, photograph or interact with mammals.
See also Use volunteers to deter tourists from harassing marine and freshwater mammals at wildlife-viewing sites.
