296: Weight baits or lines to reduce longline bycatch of seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Most birds take baits when they are close to the surface. Reducing the time that baits are at the surface by weighting them may, therefore, reduce bycatch rates.
 

Key Messages:

Three replicated and controlled studies found evidence for reduced bycatch in some species when using weighted lines. One study found low bycatch rates, but was uncontrolled.
In Hawaii and New Zealand, rates of bait loss and bycatch of albatrosses Phoebastria spp., white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis and sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus were much lower with weighted baits or integrated weight lines than with control lines.
In the North Pacific, two trials found that bycatch rates of some species was reduced when using weights, but that shearwaters Puffinus spp. attacked weighted lines more often.
A study off New Zealand found that attaching weights to lines had only localised effects on sink-rate.
