182: Use coloured baits to reduce accidental mortality during predator control
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Most birds (unlike most mammals) are visual hunters and foragers, meaning that strangely coloured baits may not be taken as readily, and so using them during eradication programmes may reduce incidental mortality.

Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled trials in the USA found that dyed baits were consumed at significantly lower rates than control baits.
A replicated, randomised and controlled trial in Australia found no differences in consumption rates of dyed and control baits.
