1879: Amphibians: Manipulate sex ratio within the enclosure
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
By manipulating sex ratios, increased competition between males for a mate could stimulate more breeding calls or mating. However, males from more aggressive species may need to be separated during this time to minimise injury to tank mates, eggs or larvae.

Key Messages:

One replicated study in AustraliaÂ found that frogs only bred once sex ratios were manipulated, along with playing recorded mating calls and moving frogs into an indoor enclosure which allowed temporary flooding, and had various types of organic substrate.
