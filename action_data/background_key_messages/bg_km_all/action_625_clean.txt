625: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of vultures
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).
 

Key Messages:

Four studies of two release programmes found that release programmes led to large population increases in Andean condors Vultur gryphus in Colombia and griffon vultures Gyps fulvus in France.
A small study in Peru found high survival of released Andean condors Vultur gryphus over 18 months, with all fatalities occurring in the first six months after release.
