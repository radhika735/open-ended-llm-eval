3692: Protect nests and nesting sites from predation using visual deterrents
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
A range of visual deterrents, including flags, may be used to deter predators from approaching reptile nests and nesting sites. If successful, such deterrents could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of protecting nests and nesting sites from predation using visual deterrents on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.
