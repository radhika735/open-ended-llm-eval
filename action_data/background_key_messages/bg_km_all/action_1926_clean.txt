1926: Carnivores: Provide live invertebrate prey, including in feeding devices
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
For some carnivores, providing live invertebrates is a good form of feeding enrichment as it stimulates natural hunting behaviours. For example, providing crickets in a dispenser which is put under a mound, or placing crickets inside a pumpkin are methods which have been tried with some small felid species.

Key Messages:

One replicated study in the USA found that provision of live prey increased explorative behaviours in fennec foxes compared to other types of enrichment.
