3488: Manage tillage practices
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Conventional ploughing or tilling disturbs the soil to about 25–35 cm (Tebrügge & Düring 1999). Ploughing can impact reptiles when individuals are buried by ploughing activity (Saumure et al. 2007), or when ploughing destroys nesting sites (Hódar et al. 2000). A number of methods can be used to reduce the depth or intensity of ploughing such as layered cultivation, non-inversion tillage and conservation tillage. Such practices have been found to be beneficial for some farmland biodiversity (Holland & Luff 2000). ‘Conservation agriculture’ attempts to alter the soil profile as little as possible by direct sowing and/or leaving the soil protected with plant residues (García-Torres et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of managing tillage practices on reptile populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
