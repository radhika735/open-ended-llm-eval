2465: Use tranquilizers to reduce stress during translocation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Translocation of mammals can cause elevated stress levels. This may affect post-release survival (e.g. Beringer et al. 2002). Tranquilizers may be administered during the translocation process in order to reduce stress to captured mammals.
