3836: Protect greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Undeveloped land within urban areas, or greenfield sites, may provide important remnant habitat for butterfly and moth species which cannot otherwise survive in built-up areas. Protecting these sites from development may benefit populations of these sensitive species close to human populations.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of protecting greenfield sites or undeveloped land in urban areas on butterflies and moths. One study was in Singapore and the other was in Mexico.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): Two site comparison studies (including one replicated study) in Singapore and Mexico found that protected native forest and grassland in urban areas had a higher species richness of butterflies than urban parks or non-native Eucalyptus plantations.
