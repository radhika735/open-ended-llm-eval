2688: Reduce the hauling speed of a trawl net
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Hauling a trawl net back to the surface at a slow speed might allow fish to swim forward and escape the net, or if the trawl is equipped with a catch reduction device it might further encourage escape opportunities (Eayrs 2007). Whilst this may reduce the catch of unwanted fish, there is an increased potential for commercially valuable fish to also escape the trawl if hauling speed is too slow. Hauling at a slower speed may also reduce fish stress and physical damage which may result in higher survival if discarded.
Evidence for similar interventions is summarized under ‘Deployment of fishing gear and mode of operation - Reduce duration of fishing gear deployments’ and ‘Change the towing speed of a trawl net’. See also ‘Handling of Catch’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of reducing the hauling speed of a trawl net on marine fish populations.

 ‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
