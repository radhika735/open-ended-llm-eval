3295: Disturb soil/sediment surface before planting trees/shrubs: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This action involves shallow disturbance of the top few centimetres of soil/sediment (and any vegetation on it), without permanently removing any soil/sediment. Mechanical disturbance could be carried out by tilling, ploughing, disking or scarifying. It may improve survival or growth of planted vegetation. It can clear potentially competing vegetation, and loosen up the soil to allow roots to penetrate more easily.
Related actions: Remove surface soil/sediment before planting; Bury surface soil/sediment before planting, including by deep ploughing.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of disturbing the surface of brackish/saline wetlands before planting trees/shrubs. The study was in Australia.

Height (1 study): One replicated, controlled study on an estuarine mudflat in Australia found that ploughing the substrate before planting grey mangrove Avicennia marina propagules had no significant effect on their height after two growing seasons.
