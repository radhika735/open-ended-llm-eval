1333: Primates: Provide live invertebrates
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Releasing live insects or other invertebrates into enclosures aims to encourage more natural foraging behaviour in primates which hunt live prey in the wild. Live insects attract the attention of the primate, encouraging natural behaviours such as chasing, stalking and pouncing.
 

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in the UK found that when provided with live insect prey inactivity reduced and foraging increased in captive loris to levels seen in wild loris.
