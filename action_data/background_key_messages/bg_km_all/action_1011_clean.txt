1011: Vaccinate bats against the white-nose syndrome pathogen
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Vaccinating bats against the white-nose syndrome pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans could reduce bat mortality. However, an effective vaccine has yet to be developed and practical methods for large-scale implementation would need to be investigated. Research is on-going.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats against the white-nose syndrome pathogen on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
