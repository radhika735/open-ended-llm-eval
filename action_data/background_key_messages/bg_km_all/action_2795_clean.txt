2795: Limit the length of fishing gear in an area
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Limiting the length of fishing gear, such as ropes, lines, or nets, in an area may reduce the risk of entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) of marine and freshwater mammals. This could involve using shorter ropes or lines, or using multiple pots, traps or nets on each line.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting the length of fishing gear in an area on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
