3846: Provide training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
There are a wide variety of actions which may be implemented on farmland to try and improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (see actions under “Agriculture & Aquaculture”), and agri-environment schemes are increasingly including options and packages designed to support pollinators, including butterflies and moths. Even on nature reserves, getting the right balance of habitat management can be difficult. For species with particular habitat requirements which are difficult to achieve, such as a structural diversity of grassland swards, training events for land managers and conservation staff may help to improve habitat quality for butterflies and moths (Parsons 2004).
