3869: Use patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Harvesting of timber within forests can be carried out by clearcutting sites or by various methods of harvesting a proportion of trees. Patch retention harvesting may be used as an alternative to a total clearcutting in commercial forests. Typically, around 10% of trees are retained in patches within a clearcut area. These retained patches can help maintain characteristic forest species and act as reservoirs for recolonization by forest dependent species.
For other options for harvesting timber, see “Use selective or reduced impact logging instead of conventional logging”, “Harvest groups of trees or use thinning instead of clearcutting”, “Use leave-tree harvesting instead of clearcutting”, “Use shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting” and “Retain riparian buffer strips during timber harvest”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of using patch retention harvesting instead of clearcutting.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
