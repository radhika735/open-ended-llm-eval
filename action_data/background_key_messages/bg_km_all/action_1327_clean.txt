1327: Primates: Provide live vegetation in planters for foraging
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Ground cover is important in enclosure design for primates in captivity. This is especially so for species which forage at ground level. Live plant cover aims to encourage natural food items, such as insects, into the enclosures to increase foraging levels.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA reported that chimpanzees spent more time foraging when provided with planted rye grass and scattered sunflower seeds compared to browse and grass added to the enclosure with their normal diet.
