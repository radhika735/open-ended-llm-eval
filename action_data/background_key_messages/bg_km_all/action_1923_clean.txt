Background information and definitions:
Presenting an animal with enrichment items that encourage manipulation, such as food frozen in ice, aims to increase engagement of a captive animal, encouraging active behaviours.

Two replicated, before-and-after studies in the USA found that when presented with food frozen in ice, abnormal or stereotypic behaviours decreased and activity levels increased in bears and felids.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that manipulation behaviours increased in lions, whereas a replicated study in the USA found that manipulation behaviours decreased in grizzly bears.
