2263: Pay monetary compensation for habitat damage remediation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Following damages to habitats and natural resources, for instance from pollution or physical disturbances, the guilty parties could be required to pay monetary compensation (Price et al. 2012). Such compensations can be direct monetary ‘fines’ for damages, payments towards the costs of environmental assessments, or reimbursement for remediation, restoration or offsetting actions. For instance, following the massive oil spill of 1991, a multibillion-dollar compensation was paid to several Gulf States for damages and restoration projects (Payne & Sand 2011; Price et al. 2012). Monetary compensation can benefit subtidal benthic invertebrates when used for remediation, restoration or offsetting projects (Jones et al. 2012).
Evidence related to offsetting projects for lost habitats, which can be undertaken through monetary compensation, are summarised under “Habitat restoration and creation – Offset habitat loss from human activity by restoring or creating habitats elsewhere”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of paying monetary compensation for habitat damage remediation on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
