2492: Use chili to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
This intervention covers use of chili in various forms for deterring crop damage. All studies are of its effectiveness against elephants Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus. In some cases, trials were of deterrent effects of chili against elephants that were not actively crop-raiding. Studies in this intervention are all of situations where chili repellents are targeted specifically at potential crop raiding animal, using smoke, aerosol or projectile. If successful, the intervention could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of elephants.
See also Use repellents that taste bad (‘contact repellents’) to deter crop or property damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict, which includes use of Hot Sauce® and other chili-based repellents that are applied directly to crops.

Key Messages:

Seven studies evaluated the effects on elephants of using chili to deter crop damage to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Four studies were in Zimbabwe, two were in Kenya and one was in India.

OTHER (7 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (7 studies): Five of seven studies (including four replicated and two before-and-after studies), in Zimbabwe, Kenya and India, found that chill-based deterrents (chili-spray, chili smoke, chili fences and chili extract in a projectile, in some cases along with other deterrents) repelled elephants at least initially, whist two studies found that chili smoke (and in one case chili fences) did not reduce crop raiding.
