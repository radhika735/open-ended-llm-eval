995: Retain residual tree patches in logged areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Logging by clearcutting results in large open, cleared areas in forests (clearcut blocks). Residual tree patches may be left uncut within these areas.
To be included as evidence for this intervention, studies must have monitored a comparison, i.e. compared residual tree patches that have been kept intact with similar/nearby areas where tree patches have been cut down or otherwise degraded. There must have been an active decision (i.e. intervention) to retain the residual tree patches and the study must state when the intervention was carried out.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of retaining residual tree patches in logged areas on bat populations. The three studies were in Canada.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Abundance (3 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Canada found no difference in bat activity (relative abundance) along the edges of residual tree patches and the edges of clearcut blocks. One replicated, site comparison study in Canada found that the activity of smaller bat species was higher along the edge of residual tree patches than in the centre of clearcut blocks, but the activity of larger bat species did not differ. One replicated, controlled study in Canada found that residual tree patches had similar activity of little brown bats and northern long-eared bats and lower activity of silver-haired bats compared to clearcut forest patches.
