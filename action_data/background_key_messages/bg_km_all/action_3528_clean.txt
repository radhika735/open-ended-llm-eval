3528: Install crossings over/under pipelines
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pipelines can extend hundreds of kms and may represent substantial barriers to reptile movements if they lie at or just above the surface of the ground. Crossing points can be either elevated sections of pipe with space for reptiles to pass beneath, buried sections or sections with crossing ramps constructed over the pipe.
