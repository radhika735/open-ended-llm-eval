1126: Floating pennywort: Physical removal
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Manual or mechanical removal of floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides with manual removal of any visible remaining fragments may offer a tool for localised population eradication.  For example, it is reported that floating pennywort has been eradicated from the upper reaches of the River Chelmer and the River Lee by removing as much plant biomass as possible then handpicking remaining fragments (Newman & Duenas 2010).  It is important to carefully manage any mechanical removal efforts as floating pennywort demonstrates high regeneration capacity, and is able to regenerate from small shoot fragments (Hussner 2008).

Key Messages:

A study in Western Australia found that following a two-week program of physical removal of floating pennywort, the rate of growth exceeded the rate of removal.
A study in the UK, found that removal using a mechanical digger and monthly picking by hand greatly reduced the cover of floating pennywort but did not completely eradicate it.
