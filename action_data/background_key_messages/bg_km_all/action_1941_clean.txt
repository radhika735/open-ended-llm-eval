1941: Plant field margins with a diverse mix of plant species
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Planting field margins with a diverse mix of plant species can increase the abundance and diversity of invertebrate prey for bats. See also ‘Retain unmown field margins’. For studies that may carry out this intervention alongside other interventions to benefit bats on farmland, see ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures (e.g. agri-environment schemes)’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of planting field margins with a diverse mix of plant species on bats populations. The study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that the activity (relative abundance) of soprano pipistrelles and barbastelle bats increased with a greater diversity of plant species within field margins, but there was no effect on common pipistrelle activity nor on the occurrence of any of the six bat species studied.
