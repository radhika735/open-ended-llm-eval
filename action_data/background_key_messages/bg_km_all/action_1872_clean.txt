1872: Amphibians: Vary artificial rainfall to simulate seasonal changes in the wild
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
In some amphibian habitats, rainfall is highly seasonal with the onset of rain following a dry period signaling the start of the breeding season. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating these cues within an enclosure.

Key Messages:

Two replicated, before-and-after studies in Germany and Austria found that simulating a wet and dry season, as well as being moved to an enclosure with more egg laying sites and flowing water in Austria, stimulated breeding and egg deposition. In Germany, no toadlets survived past 142 days old.
