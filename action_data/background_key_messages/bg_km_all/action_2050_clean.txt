2050: Restore or create forest or woodland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Restoring or creating forest and woodland may provide bats with important habitat in disturbed or fragmented landscapes.
A study that examined the effects of forest restoration in an urban area is described in ‘Create or restore bat foraging habitats in urban areas’.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of restoring forests on bat populations. One study was in Brazil and one in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): One site comparison study in Brazil found that a reforested area had significantly lower bat diversity than a native forest fragment.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled, site comparison study in Australia found that forests restored after mining had significantly higher or similar bat activity (relative abundance) as unmined forests for five of seven bat species.
