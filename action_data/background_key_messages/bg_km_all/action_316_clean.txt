316: Use nest covers to reduce the impact of research on predation of ground-nesting seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Researchers arriving at nesting colonies may disturb birds and, particularly with ground-nesting species, may leave them vulnerable to opportunistic predators. This predation might be reduced by protecting the nests with cages or individual barriers.
Studies describing the more general use of nest cages and predator barriers are discussed in ‘Reduce nest predation by excluding predators from nests or nesting areas’.
 

Key Messages:
A before-and-after study in Canada found that protecting Caspian tern Sterna caspia nests after researchers disturbed parents from them significantly increased hatching success. This was due to a reduction in predation by ring-billed gulls Larus delawarensis.
