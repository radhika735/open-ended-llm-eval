2009: Breed bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding may be used as a strategy to supplement or re-establish wild populations. However, simulation modelling suggests that this is unlikely to be an effective strategy for bats affected by white-nose syndrome due to a lack of specialist infrastructure and expertise, and the need for disease-free target populations (Davy & Whitear 2016).
For a general intervention relating to captive breeding, see ‘Breed bats in captivity’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
