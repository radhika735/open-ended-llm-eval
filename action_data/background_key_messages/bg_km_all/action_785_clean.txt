785: Use legislative regulation to protect wild populations
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Species can be legally protected, either nationally or internationally. Levels of protection vary but can be to prevent capturing, keeping in captivity or trading species. Such activities may be legal for certain species provided that permits are obtained from government licensing authorities.
Other studies investigating the effect of legally protecting species are discussed in ‘Residential and commercial development – Legal protection for species’.
 

Key Messages:

One review found that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in the recovery of the over-exploited populations.
One study in South Africa found that the number of permits issued for scientific and educational use of amphibians increased from 1987 to 1990.
