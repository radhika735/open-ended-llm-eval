3721: Create artificial burrows 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Artificial burrows may be created for reptiles to support new or existing populations where natural burrows are limited or have been lost, for example at newly restored sites.
Other studies investigating the creation of shelter habitat are discussed in Create artificial refuges, hibernacula and aestivation sites; Add woody debris to landscapes; and Threat: Biological resource use – Leave woody debris in forests after logging and Leave standing/deadwood snags in forests.

Key Messages:

Six studies evaluated the effects of creating artificial burrows on reptile populations. Five studies were in Australia and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that areas with artificial burrows had more pygmy blue tongue lizards than areas with no artificial burrows
Reproductive success (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that female pygmy bluetongue lizards using artificial burrows produced larger offspring than those using natural burrows.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Australia found that female pygmy bluetongue lizards using artificial burrows had better body condition than those using natural burrows.

BEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)

Use (4 studies): Three replicated studies (including one controlled study) in Australia found that artificial burrows were used by resident and translocated pygmy bluetongue lizards. One of the studies also found that pygmy bluetongue lizards preferred artificial burrows with a chamber than burrows with no chamber. One replicated study in the USA found that providing artificial burrows for translocated gopher tortoises resulted in more tortoises settling successfully in the release area.

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in Australia found that translocated pygmy blue tongue lizards used artificial burrows, and supplementary food affected the amount of time they spend in bare ground areas
