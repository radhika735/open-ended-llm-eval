1473: Introduce ammunition tax 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The concept for this intervention is that introducing a tax for ammunition and therefore making ammunition less affordable will reduce the number of cartridges that hunters can purchase and thus result in a decrease in the number of animals hunted. For example, Tweh et al. (2014) suggested that purchase and import taxes on ammunition and rifles, and the introduction of certified gun permits may help to control hunting with guns in Liberia.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of introducing ammunition tax on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
