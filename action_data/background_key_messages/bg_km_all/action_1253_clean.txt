1253: Enhance soil compaction
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
Soil compaction affects soil microclimatic conditions and nutrient availability. This can affect species composition by giving an advantage to early successional understory species.
 

Key Messages:

Three studies (including two replicated, randomized, controlled) in Canada and the USA found that soil compaction decreased tree regeneration height and density. Two of the studies found it increased understory plant cover and density, while one found it decreased understory plant species richness.
