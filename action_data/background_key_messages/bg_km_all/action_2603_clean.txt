2603: Modify vegetation along railways to reduce collisions by reducing attractiveness to mammals
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Wild mammals may be at increased risk of collisions with trains if they spend time on or close to the railway. Vegetation alongside railways may provide a feeding resource that attracts animals while, at the same time, obscuring views of oncoming trains. Removing vegetation in areas with high recorded collision rates may reduce attractiveness of such areas to mammals and, thus, reduce the risk of collision with trains.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of modifying vegetation along railways to reduce collisions by reducing attractiveness to wildlife. Both studies were in Norway.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Survival (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in Norway found that clearing vegetation from alongside railways reduced moose-train collisions.
