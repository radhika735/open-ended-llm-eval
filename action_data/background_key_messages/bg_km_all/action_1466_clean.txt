1466: Provide adequate signage of presence of primates on or near roads 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Providing adequate signage of the presence of primates on or near the road may motivate drivers to reduce their speed and be alert for possible primate road crossings, thus reducing collisions. However, signs indicating primate presence may cause an increase in primate mortality if they motivate people to illegally hunt primates in the area.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of providing adequate signage of presence of primates on or near roads on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
