2772: Issue high fines and penalties for non-compliance with fisheries regulations
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Marine fisheries throughout the world are often highly regulated and may be subject to many different international or national laws and byelaws that control what can be caught or landed, where and how much. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity is a huge threat worldwide and those engaging in criminal activity on a large scale may gain substantially financially. Heavy fines or penalties may act as a deterrent to prevent illegal fishing or non-compliance and help protect fish populations from the effects of overfishing.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of issuing high fines and penalties for non-compliance with fisheries regulations on marine fish populations. 

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
