2575: Remove or control competitors
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
The range occupied by a species may be limited by the presence of competitors. In many cases, removing native competitors may be a controversial management strategy. However, abundance increases or range expansion of a competitor species, due to habitat or land management changes, may motivate removal or control of this species if its presence negatively impacts on another species that is deemed to be a higher conservation priority.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on non-controlled mammals of removing or controlling competitors. One study was across Norway and Sweden and one was in Norway.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Reproductive success (1 study): A replicated, controlled study in Norway and Sweden found that red fox control, along with supplementary feeding, was associated with an increase in arctic fox litters.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Use (1 study): A controlled study in Norway found that where red foxes had been controlled arctic foxes were more likely to colonize.
