3628: Change the colour (spectral composition) of lighting
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Sea turtle hatchlings generally orient away from high silhouettes (dunes, trees) and towards brighter, lower horizons (light reflecting on the ocean). Artificial light is generally brighter than natural light from the moon and stars and not scattered by the atmosphere and so may interfere with the sea-orienting behaviours of sea turtle hatchlings. Changing the spectral composition of artificial light, for example using yellow rather than white lighting, may therefore mitigate some of the impact of increased levels of ambient light near to nesting beaches.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of changing the colour (spectral composition) of lighting on reptile populations. Two studies were in the USA and one was in Australia.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Behaviour change (3 studies): Two replicated, controlled studies (including one randomized study) in the USA and Australia found that yellow-tinted incandescent lighting did not affect the seaward orientation of loggerhead turtle hatchlings, whereas four other types of lighting did, and that hatchlings were disoriented in fewer trials by red lighting than by amber lighting. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found in laboratory trials that filtering out high wavelengths did not prevent loggerhead or green turtles crawling towards light sources.
