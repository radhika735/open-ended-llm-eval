3707: Develop/implement species recovery plans 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Species recovery plans are documents that set out the actions for species management. Recovery plans are more likely to be effective when they are tailored to the species at risk, revised regularly to ensure that they are up to date, and incorporate evaluation to enable efficient and effective conservation action (Boersma et al. 2001).

Conservation status (1 study): One controlled, before-and-after, paired study in Australia found that the chance of a species’ conservation status improving or being stable was similar for those with a recovery plan (including three reptile species) and those without a plan (including three reptile species).
