626: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of raptors
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Raptors can be released through a process called ‘hacking’ which was developed as a falconry method to train young birds to hunt. It involves placing broods (once they can feed themselves and regulate their body temperature) in an artificial nest site where they can be fed without imprinting on humans. The birds can learn about their environment and gradually learn to fly and hunt, with food provided until it is no longer taken (Jones 2004).

Key Messages:

Five studies of three release programmes from across the world found the establishment or increase of wild populations of falcons Falco spp.
Five studies from the USA found high survival of released raptors (with between one and 204 birds released), whilst two found that released birds behaved normally and hunted successfully.
One study from Australia found that a wedge-tailed eagle Aquila audax had to be taken back into captivity after acting aggressively towards humans, whilst another Australian study found that only one of 15 brown goshawks Accipiter fasciatus released was recovered, although the authors do not draw conclusions about survival rates from this.
