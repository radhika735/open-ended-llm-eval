2105: Set commercial catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many populations of marine subtidal benthic invertebrate species have declined or been depleted due to the multiple threats they are exposed to, including overharvesting (Hobday et al. 2000) and unintentional physical damage or catching during other fishing operations (Collie et al. 2000). Commercial fishing and harvest quotas (such as Total Allowable Catch) are a means by which many governments and local regulatory bodies regulate biological resources (species stocks). Setting catch quotas for specific fisheries (for instance cod), can potentially reduce the pressure on other species not targeted by the fishery but commonly affected or caught during fishing operations. Evidence for the use of catch quotas in recreational fishing is summarised under “Species management – Set recreational catch quotas”. Evidence for the use of catch quotas in conjunction with habitat credits system is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Set catch quotas and habitat credits systems”.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting commercial catch quotas on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations.

 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
