3615: Use a different bait type: Crocodilians
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Using alternative bait that is less attractive to marine and freshwater reptiles may reduce entanglement and capture of reptiles in fishing gear. Losses to fishers may also be reduced thereby reducing human-wildlife conflict.
Due to the number of studies found, this action has been split by species group. See here for: Sea turtles; Tortoises, terrapins, side-necked & softshell turtles or Snakes & lizards.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using a different bait type on crocodilian populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
