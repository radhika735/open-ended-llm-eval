2644: Remove competing vegetation to allow tree establishment in clearcut areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Following felling of trees, for timber harvesting, a range of actions may be employed to accelerate forest regrowth. Tree establishment (either through natural regeneration or planting) may be inhibited by rapid growth of herbaceous or scrubby vegetation. This vegetation may be controlled or removed by use of herbicides or by using tools, such as brushsaws, to physically remove such vegetation. Using such techniques to allow or encourage forest regrowth in clearcut areas may speed up the time until such habitat becomes suitable for forest-dwelling mammals.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects on mammals of removing competing vegetation to allow tree establishment in clearcut areas. Two studies were in Canada and one was in the USA.

BEHAVIOUR (3 STUDIES)

Use (3 studies): One of three studies (including two controlled studies and one site comparison study), in the USA and Canada, found that where competing vegetation was removed to allow tree establishment in clearcut areas, American martens used the areas more. One study found mixed results for moose and one found no increase in site use by snowshoe hares.
