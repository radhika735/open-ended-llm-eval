Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Two replicated and controlled trials from Europe and the USA found that owls supplied with supplementary food had higher hatching and fledging rates than control pairs. The European study, but not the American, also found that fed pairs laid earlier  and had larger clutches
The American study also found that owls were no more likely to colonise nest boxes provided with supplementary food.
