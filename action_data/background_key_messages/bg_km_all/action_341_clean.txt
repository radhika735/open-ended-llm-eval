341: Replace non-native species of tree/shrub
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
A combination of fuel reduction (e.g. by burning or understorey removal) and planting of native species could help replace an exotic mid- or understorey with a native one.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that the number of black-chinned hummingbird nests increased at sites with fuel reduction and planting of native species, but that the increase was smaller than at sites without planting.
