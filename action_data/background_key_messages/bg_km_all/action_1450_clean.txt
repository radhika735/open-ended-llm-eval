1450: Humans chase primates using bright light 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Farmers can use bright light to chase crop-raiding primates away from their fields during the day. The light source is usually a spinning glass prism that reflects light (e.g. Meerkat Optical Wildlife Rerouter). The rationale is that the spinning prism reflects light and that the bright lights will scare primates away.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of humans chasing primates using bright light to deter crop-raiding on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
