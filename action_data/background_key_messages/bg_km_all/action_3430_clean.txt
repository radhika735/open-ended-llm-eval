3430: Irrigate before or after seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
In many arid areas low rainfall may limit the success of grassland restoration. Irrigating with water alongside seeding and planting may help to improve the probability of grassland plant establishment and colonization.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of irrigating after seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with an unirrigated but seeded or planted plot). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Key Messages:

Two studies examined the effects of irrigating before or after seeding/planting on grasslands. One study was in Spain and one in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (2 STUDIES)

Overall richness/diversity (2 studies): One of two replicated, controlled studies (one of which was randomized and paired) in Spain and the USA found that irrigating after sowing non-native seeds increased plant diversity in four of 10 cases. The other study found that irrigating after sowing native seeds did not alter plant species richness.
Native/non-target species richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that irrigating after sowing seeds did not alter the species richness of native plants.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (2 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in Spain found that irrigating after sowing non-native seeds increased vegetation cover in six of 10 cases.
Native/non-target species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that irrigating after sowing seeds did not alter the cover of native plant species.
