3926: Undersow spring cereals, with clover for example 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Undersowing cereals with plants such as clover, which are able to fix nitrogen in the soil, is commonly used in agri-environment schemes to reduce the need to apply artificial fertilizer. However, these plants may also provide an important source of nectar for butterflies and moths, which could improve the value of arable land for butterfly and moth populations.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of undersowing spring cereals. One study was in the UK and one was in Switzerland.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Richness/diversity (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had a higher species richness of butterflies than extensively or conventionally managed grassland. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a larger area of in-field agri-environment scheme options, including undersown cereals, had a similar species richness of butterflies to farms with a smaller area of in-field agri-environment scheme

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that spring barley undersown with a mix of grasses and legumes had a higher abundance of butterflies, but a lower abundance of caterpillars, than extensively or conventionally managed grassland. One replicated, site comparison study in Switzerland found that farms with a larger area of in-field agri-environment scheme options, including undersown cereals, had a similar abundance of butterflies to farms with a smaller area of in-field agri-environment scheme
