3013: Implement ‘mosaic management’ when harvesting wild vegetation
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mosaic management involves managing neighbouring patches of land in different ways, across large scales. For example, while some areas of vegetation might be fully harvested in a given year, others might be left untouched. Alternatively, different areas of vegetation may be harvested at different times within a given year, or some areas might be grazed rather than harvested. In any case, different vegetation types in each patch might support different plant (and animal) species, boosting biodiversity across all patches.
To be summarized as evidence for this action, studies must have considered the overall effectiveness of mosaic management, comparing marsh or swamp vegetation across the whole mosaic to an area not under mosaic management (e.g. traditional farmland or nature reserves; Oosterveld et al. 2010). Studies comparing vegetation between individual patches would be summarized elsewhere in the synopsis.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of implementing mosaic management when harvesting wild vegetation from marshes or swamps.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
