1551: Remove/treat external/internal parasites to increase reproductive success/survival
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves removing/treating primates to reduce their external and/or internal parasite loads to increase their chances of survival, general health status and their reproductive success. This intervention frequently forms part of, but is not necessarily restricted to reintroduction or translocation programmes. To implement this intervention, primates may be temporarily captured, treated and re-released, or they may be treated using remote drug delivery methods.

Key Messages:

One before-and-after study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins treated for parasites, alongside other interventions, did not survive over seven years post-release.
Three studies, including two before-and-after studies, in the Republic of Congo and The Gambia found that 70% of reintroduced chimpanzees treated for parasites, alongside other interventions, survived for at least 3.5-5 years and in one case the population increased.
One study in Gabon found that 33% of reintroduced mandrills died within one year after release despite being treated for parasites, alongside other interventions.
Two site comparison studies in Vietnam found that most reintroduced pygmy slow lorises died or disappeared (lost radio signal soon after release) despite being treated for parasites, alongside other interventions.
One before-and-after, site comparison study in the Republic of Congo and Gabon and one before-and-after study in Gabon found that most western lowland gorillas treated for parasites, alongside other interventions, survived over nine months or four years.
