2416: Burn at specific time of year
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Fire is an integral part of the management and natural dynamics of some ecosystems. Some habitats are naturally fire-prone while in others, habitats are shaped by long-term traditional management (Bowman 1998). Some habitats are now managed through prescribed burning, partly to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. The timing of such burns may impact the mammal fauna with changes to different burning dates potentially being beneficial (or, at least, less damaging) to some species.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of burning at a specific time of year. One study was in Australia, and one was in the USA.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): A replicated, randomized, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that carrying out prescribed burns in autumn did not increase small mammal abundances or biomass relative to burning in summer.
Survival (1 study): A randomized, replicated, controlled study in Australia found that in forest burned early in the dry season, northern brown bandicoot survival rate declined less than in forests burned late in the dry season.
