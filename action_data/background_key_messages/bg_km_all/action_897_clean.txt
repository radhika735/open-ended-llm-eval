897: Grow cover crops beneath the main crop (living mulches) or between crop rows
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Organic nitrogen is found in plants and other living organisms. Inorganic or mineral nitrogen is a form of nitrogen available to plants to take up. Mineralisation is the release of nutrients such as nitrogen (changing it to inorganic or mineral nitrogen) when plants and other organic matter decomposes. Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability refers to the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Wet aggregate stability suggests how well a soil can resist raindrop impact and water erosion.
 

Key Messages:
Biodiversity: One randomized, replicated study from Spain found that cover crops increased bacterial numbers and activity.
Erosion: Two studies from France and the USA showed reduced erosion under cover crops. One controlled study showed that soil stability was highest under a grass cover, and one randomized replicated study found that cover crops reduced soil loss.
Soil organic matter: Two controlled trials from India and South Africa (one also randomized and replicated) found that soil organic matter increased under cover crops, and one trial from Germany found no effect on soil organic matter levels.
SOIL TYPES COVERED: gravelly-sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy, silty loam.
