2026: Provide suitable bat foraging and roosting habitat at expanding range fronts
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
The ability of bats to shift their ranges in response to climate change will depend on the availability of suitable foraging and roosting habitat. Protecting, creating or restoring suitable habitat at expanding range fronts may help bats to move to new areas. However, this intervention will also depend on the availability of dispersal routes between habitats. See ‘Enhance natural habitat features to improve landscape connectivity to allow for range shifts of bats’.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of providing suitable bat foraging and roosting habitat at expanding range fronts on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
