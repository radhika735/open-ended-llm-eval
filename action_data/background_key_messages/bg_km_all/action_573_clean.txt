573: Translocate rails
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Thirty-three species of rails and crakes (Rallidae) are globally threatened, of which 13 are flightless (Taylor 1996). These species are unlikely to rapidly colonise new areas or recolonise former ranges, especially as several live on islands. Therefore translocating birds to new suitable habitats is likely to be an important conservation tool.

Key Messages:

Three reviews of two translocation programmes in the Seychelles and New Zealand found high survival amongst translocated rails.
All studies found that translocated birds bred successfully, although one found that translocated takahe Porphyrio hochstetteri had lower reproductive success than birds in the source population. The other New Zealand study found no differences in breeding success between recently and formerly translocated takahe.
