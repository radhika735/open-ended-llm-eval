738: Use natural control agents: cleaner wrasse
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial salmon farms are susceptible to outbreaks of sea lice. Traditionally, control of sea lice has involved pesticide use, either through oral administration or as a bath treatment. Cleaner wrasse feed on several species of sea lice. Therefore they have been investigated as an alternative to pesticides as a control agent.

Key Messages:



Two studies in Ireland found mixed effects of cleaner wrasse on sea lice numbers infesting salmon. One controlledÂ study found corkwing and goldskinny cleaner wrasse were as effective at controlling lice infestation as chemical treatments. One replicated, controlled study found rockcook cleaner wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks.
