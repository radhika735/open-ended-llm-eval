1755: Adopt ecotourism principles/create an ecotourism site
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Tourists may visit peatlands for many reasons e.g. hiking, biking, skiing, viewing wild animals, photography and relaxation. Tourist visits could be managed with conservation in mind: minimizing damage from tourist activities, educating both staff and visitors, and providing a financial incentive to conserve natural peatland (The International Ecotourism Society 2017). These principles could be adopted by existing tourist sites, or new ecotourism sites could be created.
Key peatland types where this action may be appropriate: bogs, fens/fen meadows, tropical peat swamps.
Related actions: limit damage that may arise from tourist activities (e.g. by restricting vehicle or pedestrian access to peatlands); legally protect peatlands; raise awareness amongst the public, including about how to avoid damaging peatlands.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation, of adopting ecotourism principles or creating an ecotourism site.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
