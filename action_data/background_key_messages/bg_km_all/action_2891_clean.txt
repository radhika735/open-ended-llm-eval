2891: Inform fishers of the impacts of derelict fishing gear on mammals to encourage responsible disposal
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Mammals may become entangled in lost or abandoned fishing gear resulting in injury or death (Stelfox et al. 2016). Informing fishers of the impacts of derelict fishing gear on marine and freshwater mammals may encourage the responsible disposal of gear and reduce the risk of mammal entanglement. This may involve erecting information boards or signs at ports and marinas, placing advertisements in fishing publications, or outreach at marine/fishing events.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of informing fishers of the impacts of derelict fishing gear on mammals to encourage responsible disposal.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
