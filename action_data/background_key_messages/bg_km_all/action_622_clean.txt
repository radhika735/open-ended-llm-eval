622: Release captive-bred individuals into the wild to restore or augment wild populations of bustards
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Captive breeding is normally used to provide individuals which can then be released into the wild to either restore a population in part of the species’ former range, or to augment an existing population.
Release techniques vary considerably, from ‘hard releases’ involving the simple release of individuals into the wild to ‘soft releases’ which involve a variety of adaptation and acclimatisation techniques before release or post-release feeding and care. The following section includes studies describing the overall effects of release projects. Studies that compare specific release techniques are described elsewhere (‘Use holding pens at release sites’, ‘Use ‘anti-predator training’ to improve survival after release’ etc).
 

Key Messages:

Three reviews of a release programme for houbara bustard Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii in Saudi Arabia and a replicated trial as part of the same programme found low initial survival of released birds, but the establishment of a breeding population and an overall success rate of 41%.
The programme tested many different release techniques, discussed elsewhere, with releases being most successful if sub-adults were released, able to fly, into a large exclosure.
