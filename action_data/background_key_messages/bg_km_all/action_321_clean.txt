321: Use prescribed burning on shrublands
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
Fire can play an important part in shrublands by maintaining the balance between woody and herbaceous vegetation types. If the natural systems have been modified so that fire does not occur as regularly as it used to, for example to reduce risks to homes and property, then prescribed burning may be necessary to maintain the natural dynamics of the habitat.
 

Key Messages:

One controlled study from the USA, of eight captured, found that overall bird densities were similar between burned and unburned areas, whilst a replicated and controlled study found that species numbers and bird densities did not vary between areas burned in summer and those burned in winter.
Three studies found that some species were more abundant on areas that were burned, compared to those managed differently, or not at all. Four studies found that the densities of individual species were similar or lower on burned areas compared to control areas or those under different management.
A before-and-after study found that sage sparrows chose different nest sites before burning compared to after. A controlled study found no differences in greater sage grouse movement between burned and unburned areas.
