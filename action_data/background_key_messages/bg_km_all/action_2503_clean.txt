2503: Use pheromones to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Pheromones are chemical substances released into the environment by an animal that can affect the behaviour or physiology of other animals of the same species. If pheromones can be synthesised that deter entry to crops by wild herbivores, this could reduce the motivation among farmers for carrying out lethal control of wild herbivores.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using pheromones to deter crop damage by mammals to reduce human-wildlife conflict.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this intervention during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore, we have no evidence to indicate whether or not the intervention has any desirable or harmful effects.
