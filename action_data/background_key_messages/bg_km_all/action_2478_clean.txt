2478: Remove burnt trees and branches after wildfire
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
After wildfires, a frequent management option is to remove burnt trees but to leave branches on the ground for economic reasons and to prevent soil erosion. However, some mammals are thought to benefit from areas with a low density of woody material at ground level (e.g. Beja et al. 2007) so removing branches might benefit these species.
