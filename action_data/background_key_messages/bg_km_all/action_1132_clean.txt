1132: Floating pennywort: Excavation of banks
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Excavation of banks using a sod-cutter or ‘turf-cutter’ is a potential mechanism for removing invasive aquatic plants.  An attempt to eradicate a different invasive species called New Zealand pigmyweed Crassula helmsii using a sod cutter to excavate the plants from the banks was reported to be partially successful (Clarke 2009).

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured on the effects of excavation of banks using a sod-cutter or ‘turf-cutter’ to remove floating pennywort.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
