500: Use differently-coloured artificial nests
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
There is a possibility that birds will preferentially select nests of different colours, or that different coloured nests will have different success rates, possibly due to variable rates of predation.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated study from the USA found that two species showed different colour preferences for nest boxes, but that in each case, the preferred colour had lower nesting success than the less preferred colour.
