2954: Flood cropland when fallow to conserve freshwater marshes
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years, when crops are not being grown, could allow wetland plant communities to develop temporarily. If this fallow period occurs within a yearly cycle, annual plant species will dominate. If the fallow period is long enough and at the right time of year, these species may be able to complete their life cycle within cropland.
Related interventions: Raise water level to restore degraded marshes or swamps; Raise water level to restore/create marshes or swamps from other land uses.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on freshwater marsh vegetation, of flooding cropland during fallow seasons or years. The study was in Brazil.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Community composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Brazil found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period affected the overall community composition of wetland plants, but that the nature of the effect depended on when fields were surveyed.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study found that flooding rice fields during their fallow period had no significant effect on wetland plant species richness per site and per survey, although fewer species were recorded in the flooded fields over the year of the study.
