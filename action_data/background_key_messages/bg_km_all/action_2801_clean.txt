2801: Use stiffened materials or increase tension of fishing gear
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Using stiffened materials or increasing the tension of fishing nets, ropes or lines may reduce the risk of marine and freshwater mammals becoming entangled. However, tensioned vertical ropes may cause injuries to mammals that come into contact with them (Baldwin et al. 2012).
For another intervention that may involve stiffened gear, see Use acoustically reflective fishing gear materials.
