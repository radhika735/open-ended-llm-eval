Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Two studies (including one before-and-after, site comparison study) in the USA and Argentina found that annual prescribed fires in grassland decreased numbers of amphibian species and abundance or, along with changes in grazing regime, increased rates of species loss.
One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that spring, but not autumn or winter burns, decreased salamander abundance.
