3622: Modify fishing gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Reptiles are vulnerable to drowning when caught in fishing gear and unable to escape. Modifying gear to allow reptiles to reach the surface may keep reptiles alive should they be caught incidentally in fishing gear.
For studies describing the effects of modifying the depth at which fishing gear is deployed, see Deploy fishing gear at different depths.

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of using modified gear to reduce reptile mortality in the event of unwanted catch. This study was in the USA.
