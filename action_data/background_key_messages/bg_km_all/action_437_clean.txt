437: Remove ectoparasites from feathers to increase survival or reproductive success
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Ectoparasites have the greatest impacts on young birds, but can also reduce the fitness or condition of adults. In addition, they can be important carriers of diseases, such as ticks carrying louping ill virus LIV.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated and controlled study in the UK found that red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus treated with spot applications had lower tick and disease burdens and higher survival than controls, whilst birds with impregnated tags had lower tick burdens only.
 A replicated ex situ study in Hawaii found that CO­2 was the most effective way to remove lice from feathers, although this treatment did not kill the lice.
