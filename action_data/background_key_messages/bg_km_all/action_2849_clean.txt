2849: Use automated detection systems to prevent flood gates and locks from closing when mammals are present
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Marine and freshwater mammals may swim through water structures, such as flood gates or navigation locks, and may be stranded, drowned or crushed (e.g. Ackerman et al. 1995). This intervention involves using automated detection systems to prevent gates/locks from closing when mammals are present.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of using automated detection systems to prevent flood gates and locks from closing when mammals are present on marine and freshwater mammal populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
