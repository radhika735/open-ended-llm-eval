2048: Reinstate bat roosts in felled tree trunks
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
If bat roosts are discovered in trees after felling, it may be possible to reinstate the felled tree trunk. However, this should be considered as a last resort, and original roost trees should be protected. See ‘Retain veteran and standing dead trees as roosting sites for bats’ and ‘Protect roost trees during forest operations’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of reinstating a bat roost within a felled tree trunk on bat populations. The study was in the UK.
