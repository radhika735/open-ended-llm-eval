1639: Cut/mow to control grass and sow seed of shrubland plants
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Mowing reduces the length of all vegetation. Combined with sowing of seeds this practice may limit the growth of grasses while allowing shrubland plants to become established at grass dominated sites.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that the biomass of sagebrush plants in areas where grass was cut and seeds sown did not differ from areas where grass was not cut, but seeds were sown.
One randomized controlled study in the USA found that cutting grass and sowing seeds increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover
One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that sowing seeds and mowing did not change the cover of non-native plants or the number of native plant species.
