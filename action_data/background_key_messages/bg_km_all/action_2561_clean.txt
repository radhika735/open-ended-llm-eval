2561: Build fences around protected areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Fences may be constructed around protected areas to keep out poachers or predators, including invasive species (e.g. Hayward & Kerley 2009). They may also prevent other potentially damaging incursions, such as by off-road vehicles that may damage habitat, or casual entry by people on foot who may disturb mammals. Where protected areas are surrounded by land in which there are greater threats to wild mammals, such as persecution of carnivores, fences may reduce losses of such species by preventing them encountering these threats. Possible disadvantages of fences include inhibiting species’ dispersal, potentially leading to reductions in genetic diversity.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects on mammals of building fences around protected areas. One study was in Kenya and one was in Mozambique.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Richness/diversity (1 study): A before-and-after study in Kenya found that after a fence was built around a protected area, mammal species richness initially increased in both study sites, but subsequently declined at one of the sites.

POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): A paired sites study in Mozambique found that inside a fenced sanctuary there were more mammal scats than outside the sanctuary. A before-and-after study in Kenya found that after a fence was built around a protected area, mammal abundance initially increased in both study sites, but it subsequently declined at one of the sites.
