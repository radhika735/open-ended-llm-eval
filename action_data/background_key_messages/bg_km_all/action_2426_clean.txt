2426: Publish data on ranger performance to motivate increased anti-poacher efforts
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Where poaching is a threat to mammals, patrols by rangers may be carried out as a deterrent and to apprehend poachers. Ranger teams may be operating in isolated sites and motivation may be negatively impacted. Publishing metrics on team performances may encourage greater effort with patrolling and pride in ranger team activities and achievements.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on poaching incidents of publishing data on ranger performance to motivate increased anti-poacher efforts. This study was in Ghana.
