3143: Divert/block/stop polluted water inputs
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This action involves actions that divert or block polluted water (e.g. heated, or contaminated with excess nutrients or heavy metals) to prevent it from entering marshes or swamps, for example by constructing new pipes, channels, waterways, pumps or dams. Alternatively, pollutants could be collected at source: in India and the Philippines, specially designed toilets collect urine, which is then used as a fertilizer for crops instead of being released into natural systems (DWA 2015).
Care must be taken not to cause problems in another habitat by diverting polluted water there. Also, if water inputs are stopped, they may need to be replaced with a more suitable source to prevent the focal marsh or swamp from drying out.
Related actions: Divert/block/stop saltwater inputs; Divert/block/stop freshwater inputs; Designate protected area and Provide general protection for marshes or swamps, including policies and laws to prevent pollution.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on marsh or swamp vegetation, of diverting/blocking/stopping polluted water inputs.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
