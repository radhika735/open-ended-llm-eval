1902: Carnivores: Provide bones, hides or partial carcasses
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
In captivity, mental and physical stimulation can be unfulfilled due to the limiting environment. Many animals in captivity are fed unnatural food items that may inhibit the expression of appetitive behaviours, this can cause a deterioration in oral health and the expression of abnormal, repetitive behaviours as a coping mechanism. Providing items such as bones aims to promote natural foraging or gnawing behaviours.

Key Messages:

One replicated, before-and-after study in the USA and one replicated, controlled study in Finland found that the provision of bones decreased the frequency of stereotypic behaviours in lions, tigers and Arctic foxes.
Two replicated, before-and-after studies of felids and red foxes in the USA and Norway found that the provision of bones increased activity and manipulation time.
