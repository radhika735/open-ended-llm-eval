3420: Add topsoil before seeding/planting
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
When restoring former grasslands converted to agriculture it is often necessary to introduce seeds of some or all species. One way to do this is through the addition of topsoil from intact grasslands. Translocating topsoil may help to increase the number of seeds in the soil, thereby increasing the probability of grassland plants becoming established. The addition of topsoil may also help to increase soil fertility or reduce the effects of processes that dramatically alter soil structure, such as mining or quarrying. Sowing seeds and planting may further increase the likelihood of colonisation by grassland plants.
The studies detailed in this intervention are direct tests of the effectiveness of adding topsoil before seeding or planting (e.g. by comparison with a seeded or planted plot without topsoil added). Studies that represent comparisons of seeding to unseeded plots can be found in the actions ‘Sow grass seeds’, ‘Sow grassland forb species’ or ‘Sow native grass and forbs’.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of adding topsoil before seeding/planting on grassland vegetation. The study was in the USA.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (1 STUDY)

Overall richness/diversity (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that adding topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (1 STUDY)

Sown/planted species abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that adding topsoil before sowing seeds increased the biomass of sown species in most cases.
