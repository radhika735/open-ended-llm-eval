3618: Use barriers or vegetation to reduce artificial light
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Artificial light disrupts the natural sea finding behaviour of sea turtle hatchlings as hatchlings orient towards the lowest horizon with the brightest lights. As a result, high sea walls or trees can be used to block artificial inland lighting and in doing so mitigate the impact of artificial lighting on sea turtle hatchlings (Limpus & Kamrowski 2013).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using barriers or vegetation to reduce artificial light on reptile populations. This study was in India.

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in India1 found that when casuarina plantations were in close proximity (50 m) to the high tide line, more olive ridley turtle hatchlings crawled towards the sea compared to when plantations were 500 m from the high tide line, or when there was high intensity light and no barrier.
