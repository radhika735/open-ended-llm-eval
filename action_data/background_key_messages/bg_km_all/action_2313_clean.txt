Key Messages:
Natural enemy numbers (5 studies): Two replicated studies from the USA found more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips, compared to fields without planted flower strips, in some comparisons. Two replicated, controlled studies from Italy found more natural enemies in planted flower strips than on bare ground, and one of these studies also found more species of natural enemies
One replicated, controlled study from Spain found more pollinators (Including hoverflies and beetles) on coriander flowers next to planted flower strips, compared to coriander flowers next to unplanted field margins.
