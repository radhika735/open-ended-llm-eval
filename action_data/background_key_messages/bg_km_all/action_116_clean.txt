116: Manage hedgerows to benefit wildlife (includes no spray, gap-filling and laying)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:

Hedges can be key habitats for farmland biodiversity, but they may need managing to maximize their value. Managing hedges to benefit wildlife involves one or more of the following management changes: reduce cutting frequency; reduce or avoid spraying; mow vegetation beneath hedgerows; fill gaps in hedges; coppice or lay to restore traditional hedge structure.
See also Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally, which includes studies monitoring hedgerow biodiversity in response to management outside the hedgerows.


Key Messages:

Ten studies from Switzerland and the UK (three replicated and controlled studies of which one was randomized) found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds.
Five studies from the UK (including one replicated, controlled and randomized study) found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds. Two replicated studies have shown mixed or adverse effects, with hedge management having mixed effects on invertebrates or leading to reduced hawthorn berry yield.
A replicated site comparison in the UK found hedges cut every two years had more suitable nesting habitat for grey partridge than other management regimes. A replicated study from the UK found that hawthorn berry yield was reduced when management involved removing fruit-bearing wood.
