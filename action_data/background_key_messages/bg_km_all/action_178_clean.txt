178: Plant new hedges
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Hedges are used to separate fields but are also extremely important habitats on many farms, providing heterogeneity in the landscape and resources not found elsewhere. In much of Europe, hedges are being removed as field sizes are increased, potentially reducing the biodiversity value of farmland. Planting new hedges may mitigate this change, but may be both costly and unattractive to farmers, as they can reduce the efficiency of farming.

Key Messages:
A small study from the USA found that the population of northern bobwhites increased following several interventions including the planting of new hedges.
