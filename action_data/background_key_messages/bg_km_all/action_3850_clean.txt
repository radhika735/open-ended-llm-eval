3850: Restrict recreational activities to particular areas 
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many outdoor areas, particularly those with public access, are managed for a variety of recreational activities alongside nature conservation. This may include walking, cycling or riding trails, adventure sports or camping. These activities are likely to have a detrimental effect on many species of butterfly and moth, by increasing disturbance and making some areas of habitat unsuitable. Restricting recreational activities to specific areas of a park or reserve may help to minimize these impacts, by limiting the area of disturbance and allowing species to survive in the remaining, undisturbed areas.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of restricting recreational activities to particular areas.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
