3513: Raise mowing height
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Vegetation height is important in determining the value of cropland and grassland to wildlife. High vegetation can provide more complex environments and more habitats, while short vegetation may increase the risk of predation. Cutting of crops or pasture can kill or maim reptiles causing mutilations, crushing, and other lethal injuries. It is possible that mortalities and injuries could be reduced by raising the height of cutting machinery above the soil (Saumure et al. 2007).

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of raising mowing height on reptile populations. This study was in Australia.

Behaviour change (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Australia found that in long-sward pastures or crops marbled geckos did not navigate directly towards a tree, whereas in short-sward pastures they did.
