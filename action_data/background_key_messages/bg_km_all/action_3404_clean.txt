3404: Sow seeds of parasitic species (e.g. yellow rattle)
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Many degraded grasslands are dominated by relatively few grass species. Sowing seeds of parasitic grassland plants, such as yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, may help to restrict the growth of these grasses, potentially allowing other species to increase in abundance.

Key Messages:

Six studies examined the effects of sowing seeds of parasitic species on grassland vegetation. Four studies were in the UK, one study was in Switzerland and one was in Belgium.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY (6 STUDIES)

Overall richness/diversity (6 studies): Five of six studies (including five controlled studies and one review) in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plants yellow rattle, European yellow rattle or marsh lousewort increased plant species richness and/or diversity. The other study found that sowing yellow rattle seeds did not alter plant species richness.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE (3 STUDIES)

Overall abundance (1 study): One review in the UK found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant yellow rattle led to a decrease in total plant biomass in three of four studies.
Characteristic plant abundance (1 study): One controlled study in Belgium found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant marsh lousewort increased the abundance of six target plant species.
Grass abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant European yellow rattle led to a decrease in grass cover.
Forb abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in Switzerland found that sowing seeds of the parasitic plant European yellow rattle did not alter the cover of forbs.
