208: Undersow spring cereals, with clover for example
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:


Key Messages:

Three studies from the UK, two replicated, found that there were higher densities of some study species on undersown fields or margins, compared with other fields, or that use of fields increased after they were undersown. One of these (reported in two places) found that not all species nested at higher densities. One replicated study from the UK found that various measures of grey partridge population health declined as the amount of undersown cereal on sites increased.
A replicated study from the UK found no relationship between the amount of undersown cereals on a site and the productivity of grey partridge on that site.
