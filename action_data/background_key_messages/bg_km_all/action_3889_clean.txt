3889: Remove, control or exclude native predators 
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:
Native predators of butterflies and moths (such as mammals, birds or other insects), although part of the natural ecosystem, can become problematic for threatened species if either the abundance of the predator has been increased by human activities, or the abundance of the butterfly or moth species has been reduced by human activities. In these scenarios, the removal, control or exclusion of native predators from an important area, such as around host plants used for breeding, may be necessary to enable the focal species to establish or recover.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on butterflies and moths of removing, controlling or excluding native predators. Two studies were in each of the UK and the USA and one was in Kenya.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Survival (5 studies): Three of five replicated studies (including one randomized, paired, controlled study and three paired, controlled studies) in the UK, Kenya and the USA found that using mesh cages, net sleeves and sticky resin to exclude predators (including birds and mammals and spiders and ants) increased the survival of large copper caterpillars, Boisduval silkworm eggs and caterpillars and Appalachian brown eggs and juveniles. The other two studies found that using cages or water and chemicals to exclude vertebrate or terrestrial predators (mainly ants) did not increase the survival of monarch caterpillars.
