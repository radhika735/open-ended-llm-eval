645: Use scaring devices (eg. gas guns) and other deterrents to reduce persecution of native species
Effectiveness rating: Evidence not assessed
Background information and definitions:

Native wildlife can have a significant impact on agricultural crops or features of the farmed landscape through grazing, browsing and uprooting. This intervention involves using scaring devices to discourage native wildlife from areas susceptible to damage.

 

Key Messages:

One replicated, controlled trial in Germany found phosphorescent tape was more effective than normal yellow tape at deterring deer from an area, but had no effect on wild boar or European hare.
