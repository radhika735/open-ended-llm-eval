3547: Deploy fishing gear at different depths
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Deploying fishing gear at different depths may reduce interactions with aquatic reptiles and subsequent entanglements and unwanted catch (‘bycatch’). For example, nets may be partially submerged and allow access to the surface, or lines may be set at depths outside of the foraging range of key species. However, the feasibility of this intervention will depend on the type of fishery and the ecology of the target species.

Key Messages:

Three studies evaluated the effects of deploying fishing gear at different depths on reptile populations. One study was in each of Canada, off the coast of Mexico and the Atlantic.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Survival (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired study in Canada found that no turtles died in floated nets, but some died in submerged nets.
Condition (1 study): One replicated, randomized, paired study in Canada found that turtles caught in floated nets were less at risk of drowning than those caught in submerged nets.

BEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)
OTHER (3 STUDIES)

Unwanted catch (3 studies): Two of three studies (including two replicated studies) in Canada, Mexico and the Atlantic found that bottom-set fishing nets with fewer buoys caught fewer sea turtles than standard nets or that fewer loggerhead turtles were caught when longline hooks were set below 22 m deep, but the number of leatherback turtles caught was unaffected by hook depth. The other study found that floated and submerged nets caught a similar number of turtle species.
