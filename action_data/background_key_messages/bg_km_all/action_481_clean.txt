481: Provide artificial nesting sites for burrow-nesting seabirds
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Many petrels and shearwaters and auks nest underground in burrows dug themselves or burrowing mammals such as rabbits. This means that they require very different artificial nests to the ground- and tree-nesting species discussed in the previous section.
 

Key Messages:

Four studies from across the world found evidence for population increases or new populations being established in petrel species following the provision of nest boxes. In two cases nest boxes were combined with the translocation of chicks or other interventions.
Six studies from across the world found high occupancy rates for artificial burrows by seabirds, with three finding that occupancy increased over time, taking years to build up. Three studies from across the world found very low occupancy rates for artificial burrows used by petrel species.
Eight studies from across the world found that the productivity of birds using artificial burrows was high, in many cases as high or higher than in natural burrows. One replicated study from the USA and a small study from the Galapagos found low productivity of petrels using artificial burrows.
