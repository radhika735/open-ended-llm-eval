1867: Amphibians: Simulate rainfall using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
For some species, breeding is seasonal and may be triggered by increased or decreased rainfall. It may be possible to trigger breeding by simulating such cues within an enclosure. Studies investigating the effect of varying artificial rainfall to simulate seasonal changes in the wild are discussed in 2.11.

Key Messages:

No evidence was captured for the effects of simulating rainfall using sound recordings of rain and/or thunderstorms.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
