3542: Introduce alternative income sources to replace hunting or harvesting of reptiles
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Introducing appropriate alternative income-generating activities may reduce the reliance of communities on earning money from collecting/hunting and selling wild animals, and in turn reduce the collecting/hunting pressure on wild populations. Studies in this section should ideally directly test the effect of the intervention on wild populations, as well as the income benefits and participation levels within the communities.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on reptile populations of introducing alternative income sources to replace hunting or harvesting of reptile populations. This study was in St Kitts1.
