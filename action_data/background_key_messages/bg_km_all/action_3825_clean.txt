3825: Implement multi-year or long-term management strategies
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Commercial fish stocks may be managed annually using reference points or target yields estimated for a single species, the status of which may typically be assessed by separate species. However, the effectiveness of management measures may not occur over a single year so multi-year or long-term management plans may be implemented that may be more effective over time to ensure stocks are sustainable and exploited populations allowed to recover from the effects of overfishing.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of implementing multi-year or long-term management strategies on marine fish populations. The study was worldwide.

Stock status (1 study): One worldwide study found that commercial fisheries with multi-year or long-term management plans in place, among other management and governance strategies, had stocks that were more likely to be sustainable and less likely to be in decline compared to fisheries typically without long-term objectives.
