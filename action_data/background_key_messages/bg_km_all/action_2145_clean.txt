2145: Use different bait species in traps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Traps or pots are static gears often used to fish for crabs or lobsters. They consist of structures into which species of commercial interest enter through funnels. These funnels encourage entry but limit escape, and often catch a large amount of unwanted catch species (Stevens 1996). Traps or pots can also be baited to further encourage entry. By using a different bait species, for instance one that is less attractive to certain unwanted catch species, the amount of unwanted catch can potentially be reduced (Major et al. 2017). Evidence for other interventions related to reducing accidental and/or unwanted catch in trap and pot fishery is summarised under “Threat: Biological resource use – Modify the position of traps”, “Modify the design of traps”, “Fit one or more soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames on pots and traps” and “Fit one or more mesh escape panels/windows on pots and traps”.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of using different bait species in traps on subtidal benthic invertebrates. The study took place in the South Pacific Ocean (New Zealand).

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Unwanted catch abundance (1 study): One replicated, controlled study in the South Pacific Ocean found that the type of bait used in fishing pots did not change the amount of unwanted invertebrates caught.
