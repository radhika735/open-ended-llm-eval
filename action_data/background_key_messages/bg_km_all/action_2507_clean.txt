2507: Captive rear in large enclosures prior to release
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Captive-bred mammals may take time to adapt to conditions in the wild post-release, making them especially vulnerable to predation, starvation and disease. If they are reared in large enclosures, with habitat that resembles natural conditions, they may develop more natural behaviour and be better able to find food and shelter in the wild, compared to those animals reared in smaller pens.

Key Messages:

Four studies evaluated the effects of captive rearing mammals in large enclosures prior to release. Two studies were in the USA, one was in Mexico and one was in Australia.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)

Reproductive success (1 study): A study in Mexico found that peninsular pronghorn taken from the wild and kept in a large enclosure bred successfully and the population increased, providing stock suitable for reintroductions.
Survival (2 studies): A replicated, controlled study in USA found that black-footed ferrets reared in outdoor pens had higher post-release survival rates than did ferrets raised indoors. A controlled study in Australia found that Tasmanian devils reared free-range in large enclosures did not have greater post-release survival rates than animals from intensively managed captive-rearing facilities.
Condition (1 study): A controlled study in Australia found that Tasmanian devils reared free-range in large enclosures did not gain more body weight post-release compared to animals from intensively managed captive-rearing facilities.

BEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)

Behaviour change (1 study): A controlled study in USA found that captive-bred black-footed ferrets raised in large enclosures dispersed shorter distances post-release than did ferrets raised in small enclosures.
