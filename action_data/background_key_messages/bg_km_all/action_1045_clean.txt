1045: American bullfrog control: Direct removal of adults
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Direct removal of adults by trapping, shooting, hand spearing, hand capture, use of artificial refuges, or electro-shocking, may offer a tool for localised population reduction when used as part of an integrated pest management strategy for controlling invasive bullfrog populations.
 

Key Messages:

One replicated study in Belgium found catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using one double fyke net for 24 h to be very low. 
One small study in the USA found that bullfrog adults can be captured overnight in a single trap floating on the water surface. 
One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of the adults.
One before-and-after study in France found a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles following the shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction, when carried out as part of a combination treatment.
