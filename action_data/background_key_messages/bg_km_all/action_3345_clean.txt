3345: Plant vegetation into heavy containers
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Heavy containers (e.g. concrete pots, car tyres) may help to anchor planted vegetation in place, especially in high-energy environments. Vegetation could be grown off-site in containers and then transplanted to the field. Alternatively, vegetation could be planted directly into containers in the field. Consider using containers that will break down or can be removed once the plants are established, e.g. biodegradable concrete (Krumholz & Jadot 2009).

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects of planting emergent wetland vegetation into heavy containers.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
