290: Use a line shooter to reduce seabird bycatch
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be ineffective or harmful
Background information and definitions:
As a longline is deployed it will be put under tension as the movement of the boat stretches the line. This can delay the sinking of the line and baits, increasing the time available for birds to get hooked. A line shooter works by deploying the line faster than the boat is moving, removing tension from it and allowing the line to sink faster.
 

Key Messages:

A randomised, replicated and controlled trial from a pelagic fishery in the North Pacific found significantly higher seabird bycatch when a line shooter was used to set longlines.
A second randomised, replicated and controlled trial (from Norway), found no effect of a line shooter on bycatch rates.
