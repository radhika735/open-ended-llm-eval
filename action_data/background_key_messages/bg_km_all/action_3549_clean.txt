3549: Set unwanted catch quotas
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Fishing can impact reptiles by catching individuals unintentionally or causing injury or death through entanglements in fishing gear. Unwanted catch (‘bycatch’) quotas are used to set catch limits for unwanted species. When the quota for a particular species is reached, the fishery may be closed to all forms of fishing likely to catch that species. This may reduce the pressure on populations of reptiles that are caught accidentally and allow time for populations to recover.
See also: Set commercial catch quotas.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of setting unwanted catch quotas on reptile populations. This study was in the USA.

Survival (1 study): One study in the USA found that following the re-opening of a swordfish long-line fishery with turtle catch limits in place, loggerhead turtle bycatch reached the annual catch limit in two of three years, and when the limit was reached the fishery was closed for the rest of the year.
