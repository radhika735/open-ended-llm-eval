454: Reduce pesticide or herbicide use generally
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Pesticides and herbicides are likely to reduce the plant and insect diversity on farmland and this, in turn, can reduce food supplies for birds. Reducing these inputs may therefore help bird populations. Reductions can be accomplished by using smaller quantities or fewer applications. See also ‘Pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures’ and ‘Reduce management intensity on permanent grassland’.
 

Key Messages:

A single small study from the UK investigated population level effects of reduced chemical inputs, and found that the populations of some species increased when pesticide use was restricted alongside other interventions.
Three studies, two replicated, one controlled, from the UK found that some or all species were found at higher densities on sites with reduced pesticide inputs, in one case with other interventions as well. Five studies from the UK, four replicated, four controlled, found that some or all species were not found at higher densities on fields or sites with reduced chemical inputs, or were not associated with reduced inputs.
A controlled before-and-after study from the UK found that grey partridge Perdix perdix chicks had higher survival on sites with reduced pesticide applications. A replicated study from the UK found that reduced chemical inputs had a negative relationship with partridge brood size and no relationship with survival or the ratio of young to old birds.
