2354: Retain wildlife corridors in residential areas
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Residential and commercial developments can fragment home ranges of mammal species, making access to some resources difficult or dangerous. Retention of wildlife corridors, such as undeveloped land, riversides, woodland strips or other habitat through which mammals can pass, may help to reduce or mitigate some of these impacts of development.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects on mammals of retaining wildlife corridors in residential areas. This study was in Botswana.
