3297: Add upland topsoil before/after planting non-woody plants: brackish/saline wetlands
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Topsoil can be a source of soil organic matter and help to improve water retention (Bruland & Richardson 2004). This might benefit wetland vegetation, particularly when creating new marshes. Topsoil may often be added to complement planting (current intervention) rather than without planting: upland soil will probably not contain seeds or fragments of marsh plants. Caution: Topsoil may contain seeds or fragments of undesirable vegetation.
Related actions: Add upland topsoil, other than to complement planting; Transplant wetland soil before/after planting.

Key Messages:
We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of adding upland topsoil to brackish/saline wetlands planted with emergent, non-woody plants.
 
‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
