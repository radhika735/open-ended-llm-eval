3087: Control problematic plants (multiple interventions): freshwater marshes or swamps
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers control of problematic plants using &gt;3 separate interventions at once, such that it is difficult to attribute outcomes to any single specific intervention. Where three or fewer interventions have been used together in a study, it is included as evidence for each intervention elsewhere in the synopsis (whilst explicitly noting the use of multiple interventions in each summary paragraph).
For this section, “vegetation” refers to overall or non-target vegetation. Studies that only report responses of target problematic plants have not been summarized.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects, on vegetation, of controlling problematic plants in freshwater marshes or swamps using &gt;3 combined interventions. The study was in Costa Rica.

VEGETATION COMMUNITY

Overall extent (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that coverage of live vegetation stands was lower in a plot where southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years than in a plot where cattail had not been controlled.
Overall richness/diversity (1 study): The same study reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had greater plant species richness than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.

VEGETATION ABUNDANCE

Overall abundance (1 study): One controlled study in a freshwater marsh in Costa Rica reported that a plot in which southern cattail Typha domingensis had been controlled for &gt;15 years had less live vegetation cover than a plot where cattail had not been controlled.
