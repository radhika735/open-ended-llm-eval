2788: Educate local communities and fishers on mammal protection laws to reduce killing of marine and freshwater mammals
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Many countries have legislation in place to protect marine and freshwater mammals. However, a lack of public awareness of the relevant laws may contribute to illegal activities, such as hunting and killing of protected mammals. Educating local communities and fishers on mammal protection laws may help to reduce killing of marine and freshwater mammals.
See also Inform local communities and fishers about the negative impacts of hunting to reduce the killing of marine and freshwater mammals.
