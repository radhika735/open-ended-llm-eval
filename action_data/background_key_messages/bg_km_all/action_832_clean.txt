832: Reduce pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use 
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural land often receives high chemical inputs to control pests, weeds and fungal infections. These chemicals also enter water bodies through spray drift or run-off. With both aquatic and terrestrial life stages, amphibians can be exposed to toxicants in two environments. These pollutants can have significant effects on populations. For example, atrazine is one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. One study found that atrazine caused 10–92% of wild male leopard frogs Rana pipiens tested across the USA to have abnormal reproductive organs including slowed development and development of egg cells within their testes (Hayes et al. 2002).

Key Messages:

One study in Taiwan found that halting pesticide use along with habitat management increased a population of Taipei frogs.
