1044: American bullfrog control: Fencing
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Fencing can be used to reduce population dispersal, thereby reducing the spread of the American bullfrog to neighbouring water bodies.  This is particularly useful to contain new populations, and also for use during other control efforts.
