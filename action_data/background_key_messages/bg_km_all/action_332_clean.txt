Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Variable retention timber management is a silvicutural technique designed to retain habitat features important for wildlife e.g. large trees, snags and woody debris. This method of harvesting does not seek to maximize timber production.
 

Key Messages:
A replicated, controlled study from the USA found that nine bird species occurred at higher densities in stands under variable retention management, compared to control stands. Five were found at lower densities.
