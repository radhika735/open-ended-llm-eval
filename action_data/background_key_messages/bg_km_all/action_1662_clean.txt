1662: Use fences to exclude large herbivores
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
High densities of large herbivores such as deer or non-native feral livestock have been shown to reduce species diversity and limit the regeneration of shrublands in some parts of the world (Perea et al. 2014). Using fences to exclude these species from shrublands may help plants to increase in height and cover.

Key Messages:

One controlled study in the USAÂ found that using fences to exclude deer increased the height of shrubs, but not shrub cover.
