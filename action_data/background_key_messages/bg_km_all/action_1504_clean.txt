1504: Restrict the number of people that are allowed access to site  
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Primates are able to tolerate different levels of disturbance. For species that are relatively sensitive to human disturbance, it may be possible to reduce human impact with access restrictions. Reducing access may help to reduce the risk of human introduction of disease, stress, and any physical destruction of primate habitat and resources.
            Prohibiting people from accessing primate habitat altogether is discussed under ‘Build fences to keep humans out’.

Key Messages:

We found no evidence for the effects of restricting the number of people that are allowed access to the site on primate populations.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
