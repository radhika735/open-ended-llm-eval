2051: Restore or create grassland
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Grassland provides an important foraging habitat for many bat species, particularly unimproved or semi-unimproved species-rich grassland that has not been intensively grazed, drained or treated with artificial fertilisers or herbicides. Management of grassland may involve a combination of interventions that involve specific mowing or grazing regimes and reduced inputs.
A study that involves the restoration of grassland alongside other habitats at ex-quarry sites is described in ‘Restore bat foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of creating grassland on bat populations. The study was in the UK.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One replicated, paired sites study in the UK found that pipistrelle activity (relative abundance) did not differ between species-rich grassland created on agri-environment scheme farms and improved pasture or crop fields on conventional farms.
