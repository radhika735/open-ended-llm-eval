380: Control mammalian predators on islands for pigeons 
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
The pink pigeon Nesoenas mayeri is an endangered species from Mauritius that declined to just ten wild individuals in 1990 before intensive captive breeding and in situ management. The species is still under pressure from several threats, including predation by introduced mammals: crab-eating macaque Macaca fascicularis, Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, rats Rattus spp. and feral cats Felis catus (Reese Lind 1994; Swinnerton 2001).
The effectiveness assessment of the control of mammalian predators on islands was carried out across all bird species groups.

Key Messages:
Two before-and-after trials on Mauritius found that fewer pink pigeon Columba mayeri nests were predated and more chicks were fledged following systematic and intensive rat control.
