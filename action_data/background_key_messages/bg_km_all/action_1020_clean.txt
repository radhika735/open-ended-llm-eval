1020: Use ultraviolet filters on lights
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Ultraviolet filters may be fitted to existing lights to filter out the ultraviolet component and reduce the attraction of insects and foraging bats. For similar interventions, see ‘Use ‘warm white’ rather than ‘cool’ LED lights’ and ‘Use red lighting rather than other lighting colours’.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of using ultraviolet filters on lights on bat populations. The study was in the UK.

POPULATION RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Abundance (1 study): One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that hedges lit with ultraviolet filtered lights had higher soprano pipistrelle, but not common pipistrelle activity (relative abundance) than hedges lit with unfiltered light.
