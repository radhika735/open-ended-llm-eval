1088: Ponto-Caspian gammarids: Control movement of gammarids
Effectiveness rating: Unlikely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Containment of invasive gammarids can help to prevent their spread both within the invaded waterway and also reduce the likelihood of them being transported into new waterbodies.
 

Key Messages:

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in the USA found that movements of invasive freshwater shrimp slowed down or stopped when they were placed in water that had been exposed to different species of predatory fish, compared to those not exposed to fish. 
A replicated laboratory study in the UK found carbonating the water stunned invasive killer shrimp.
