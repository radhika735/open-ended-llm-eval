1924: Carnivores: Present food inside objects (e.g. Boomer balls)
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Providing food inside objects provides an animal with the opportunity to manipulate their food, increasing engagement and foraging behaviours see 2.16.

Key Messages:

Two before-and-after studies in Germany and India found that exploratory and foraging behaviours increased and stereotypic behaviours decreased in sloth bears and spectacled bears when presented with food inside objects.
One before-and-after study in the USA found that exploring/foraging behaviours decreased in a sloth bear when presented with food inside objects.
One replicated study in the USA found that grizzly bears spent a similar time manipulating food in a box and freely available food.
