99: Manage land under power lines to benefit wildlife
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:

This intervention may involve managing the unfarmed land under power lines to provide benefits to wildlife. For instance one study in the USA found more bee species under power lines managed for wildlife (areas of dense scrub) than in areas of annually mown grassland (Russell et al. 2005).

Key Messages:

We have captured no evidence for the effects of managing land under power lines to benefit wildlife on farmland wildlife.

'No evidence' for an action means we have not yet found any studies that directly and quantitatively tested this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
