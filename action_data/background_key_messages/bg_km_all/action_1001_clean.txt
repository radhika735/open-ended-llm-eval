1001: Restore and maintain microclimate in modified caves
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
Modifying caves may alter the internal microclimate and make conditions unsuitable for roosting bats. It is important that the microclimate is maintained following any modification. Restoring the microclimate of altered caves may also encourage cave-dwelling bats to return to abandoned roosts.
For a similar intervention, see ‘Maintain microclimate in closed/abandoned mines'. See also ‘Install and maintain cave gates to restrict public access’ for one study in which a stone wall and gate influenced the microclimate of a cave with an effect on hibernating bats.

Key Messages:

We found no studies that evaluated the effects of restoring and maintaining the microclimate in modified caves for roosting bats on bat populations.

‘We found no studies’ means that we have not yet found any studies that have directly evaluated this action during our systematic journal and report searches. Therefore we have been unable to assess whether or not the action is effective or has any harmful impacts. Please get in touch if you know of such a study for this action.
