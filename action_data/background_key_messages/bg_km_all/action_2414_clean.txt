2414: Pay farmers to compensate for losses due to predators/wild herbivores to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Where farmers suffer losses to wild mammals, either through predation of livestock or damage to crops, they may carry out lethal control of those mammals. Compensation schemes provide payments for losses to wild mammals and can have certain conditions, such as cessation of using lethal control or improving animal husbandry to reduce losses. The intervention includes schemes that make payments linked directly to losses (e.g. paying for each animal predated) and schemes that where payment is not linked directly to losses but instead to other mechanism that reduce incentives for killing wild mammals.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects on mammals of paying farmers compensation for losses due to predators or wild herbivores to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Three studies were in Kenya and one each was in Italy and Sweden.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): Two studies, in Italy and Sweden, found that compensating livestock owners for losses to predators led to increasing populations of wolves and wolverines.
Survival (3 studies): Three before-and-after studies (including two replicated studies), in Kenya, found that when pastoralists were compensated for livestock killings by predators, fewer lions were killed.
