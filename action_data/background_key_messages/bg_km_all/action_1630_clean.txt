1630: Cut trees
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
This section considers the cutting of mature trees, but not mowing to control trees. Cutting targets only trees, whereas mowing cuts all plants in a community.

Key Messages:

One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that cutting birch trees increased density of heather seedlings but not that of mature common heather plants.
One replicated, controlled study in South Africa found that cutting non-native trees increased herbaceous plant cover but did not increase cover of native woody plants.
One site comparison study in South Africa found that cutting non-native Acacia trees reduced shrub and tree cover.
