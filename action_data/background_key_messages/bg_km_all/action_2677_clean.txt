2677: Establish territorial fishing use rights
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Territorial fishing use rights is an area-based way of managing marine resources that gives exclusive harvesting rights to fish in a specified area to certain groups of people. These are usually allocated to and managed locally by groups of fishers working in a cooperative system. They may also be part of co-management systems with the government under national or regional frameworks. Territorial fishing use areas can be used to control fishing mortality and enforce fisher compliance. The benefits may include resource and habitat conservation and improved community participation and decision-making at a local scale.

Key Messages:

One study examined the effects of establishing territorial fishing use rights in an area on marine fish populations. The study was in the Pacific Ocean (Tonga).

Reduction of fishing effort (1 study): One study in the Pacific Ocean found that there was no decrease in overall fishing effort in an area with new territorial fishing use rights and a co-management system, in the five years after implementation.
Commercial catch abundance (1 study): One study in the Pacific Ocean found that in an area with new territorial fishing use rights and a co-management system, total fish catch rates did not increase and catch rates of three of six individual fish groups decreased in the first five years.
