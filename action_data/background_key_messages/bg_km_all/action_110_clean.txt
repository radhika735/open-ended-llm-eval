110: Remove coarse fish
Effectiveness rating: No evidence found (no assessment)
Background information and definitions:
This intervention involves removing coarse fish from waterbodies on farmland. Coarse fish include species such as common carp Cyprinus carpio which are typically stocked at high levels for recreational fishing. These species may have a negative impact on aquatic wildlife through competition for resources, predation and damage to habitats. Removal of coarse fish may benefit wildlife including waterbirds by reducing competition (Phillips 1992).
