2446: Deter predation of livestock by using shock/electronic dog-training collars to reduce human-wildlife conflict
Effectiveness rating: Beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Electric shock collars may be used on mammalian predators as a form of aversive conditioning. A shock is administered if the animal approaches or attacks livestock. Some studies summarized below test the potential for aversive conditioning to work on captive animals using non-live food and some others studies look at wild mammals, but using artificial food. Whilst not directly assessing the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing livestock predation, these studies provide evidence as to the potential for shock collars to alter animalsâ€™ behaviour in a way that could potentially be applied to wild predators in livestock production areas. If using shock collars can reduce livestock predation, this could reduce incentives for carrying out lethal control of predators.

Key Messages:

Five studies evaluated the effects of using shock/electronic dog-training collars to deter predation of livestock to reduce human-wildlife conflict. All five studies were in the USA.

OTHER (5 STUDIES)

Human-wildlife conflict (5 studies): Three of four replicated studies (including two controlled studies), in the USA, found that electric shock collars reduced livestock predation or bait consumption by wolves, whilst one found that they did not reduce wolf bait consumption. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that electric shock collars reduced the frequency of attacks by captive coyotes on lambs.
