3519: Provide or maintain hedgerows on farmland
Effectiveness rating: Awaiting assessment
Background information and definitions:
Agricultural intensification, including increases in field sizes and pesticides use, has resulted in a loss of field boundary habitats, such as hedgerows. These features can provide a relatively undisturbed habitat for wildlife in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Hedge planting and maintenance of existing hedges has, therefore, been proposed as a means of preserving and enhancing biodiversity. Such management is sometimes funded through agri-environmental schemes.
This action does not include studies on the effect of uncultivated margins, which are included in Create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of providing or maintaining linear features on reptile populations. This study was in Madagascar.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (1 STUDY)

Community composition (1 study): One site comparison study in Madagascar found that reptile communities in cultivated areas with hedges were more similar to those found in forests than were communities from cultivated areas without hedges. The study also found that more reptile species were found only areas with hedges than only in areas without hedges.
