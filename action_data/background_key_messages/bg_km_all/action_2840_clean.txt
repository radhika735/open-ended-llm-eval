2840: Train tourist guides to minimize disturbance and promote marine and freshwater mammal conservation
Effectiveness rating: Unknown effectiveness
Background information and definitions:
Tourist guides may be trained to minimize disturbance to marine and freshwater mammals during tours, and to promote conservation. This may include training to follow specific guidelines (e.g. see Introduce and enforce regulations for marine and freshwater mammal watching tours). Promoting marine and freshwater mammal conservation during tours may help to improve the behaviour of attendees towards mammals, not only during tours but also in future.

Key Messages:

One study evaluated the effects of training tourist guides to minimize disturbance and promote marine and freshwater mammal conservation. The study was in the Kenai Fjords (Alaska).
