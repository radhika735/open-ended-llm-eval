331: Use selective harvesting/logging instead of clearcutting 
Effectiveness rating: Trade off between benefit and harms
Background information and definitions:
It has been suggested that conservation aimed at maintaining bird populations and economic need for timber extraction can be compatible if extraction methods minimize creation of large clearcut areas. One such method is selective logging (removing one or two trees and leaving the rest intact) that maintains an uneven-age forest structure and creates openings typically smaller than 0.4 ha, and often considered a sustainable alternative to clear-cutting. However, predators and avian nest parasites are often most common in edge habitat, thus potentially reducing reproductive success of birds breeding near forest edges.
 

Key Messages:

Six studies of seven from the USA and Canada found that some species were more abundant in selective-logged forests, whilst others were less abundant, compared to both control stands and other managements. One study found that there were no consistent differences between selectively harvested and clearcut stands.
A replicated study from the USA found a lower species richness of cavity-nesting birds in snags in selectively-logged stands, compared to clearcuts.
A replicated study from the USA found that brood parasitism of two species by brown-headed cowbirds was higher in harvested stands compared to controls, but it was lower for two others.
