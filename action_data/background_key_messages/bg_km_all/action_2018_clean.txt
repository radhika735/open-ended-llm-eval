2018: Avoid illumination of bat foraging, drinking and swarming sites
Effectiveness rating: Likely to be beneficial
Background information and definitions:
Key bat habitats such as foraging, drinking and swarming sites should be left unlit to avoid disturbance to bats. Dark buffer zones may also be retained around them.

Key Messages:

Two studies evaluated the effects of avoiding the illumination of bat drinking sites on bat populations. Both studies were in Italy and one was also in Israel.

COMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)
POPULATION RESPONSE (2 STUDIES)

Abundance (2 studies): Two replicated before-and-after studies (one randomized) in Italy found that unlit water troughs had greater activity (relative abundance) of five of six bat species/species groups and six of eight bat species/species groups than troughs illuminated with artificial light. One of the studies also found that unlit desert ponds in Israel had greater activity (relative abundance) of three bat species than illuminated ponds.
