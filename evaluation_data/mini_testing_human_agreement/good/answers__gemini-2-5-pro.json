    "answer": "Integrated aquaculture systems are a promising solution for mitigating pollution from salmon farm waste by using other species to consume and filter the waste.\n\nOne of the most effective methods to address waste from salmon farms is the implementation of integrated aquaculture systems [932]. This approach involves cultivating other species alongside salmon that can utilize the waste products. For instance, a study in Canada demonstrated that blue mussels can effectively absorb waste directly from salmon farms, while another study in the USA observed that scallops experienced greater growth when raised in close proximity to fish farms [932]. Additionally, research in Scotland has shown that algae growth is enhanced when placed near fish farms, indicating its potential to absorb excess nutrients [923]. While other general pollution control actions exist, such as setting regulatory bans on marine burials of pollutants [3595] or cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment [1778], integrated aquaculture offers a more direct and symbiotic solution to the specific issue of salmon farm waste.",
