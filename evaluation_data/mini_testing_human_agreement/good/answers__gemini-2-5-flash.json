    "answer": "The most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears include using conditioned taste aversion, preventing access to food and denning sites, scaring or deterring them from human-occupied areas, and installing effective electric fencing.\n\nFor black bears, using conditioned taste aversion by lacing foodstuffs with illness-inducing substances can lead to the avoidance of those foods in non-residential sites (Action ID: 2384). Preventing mammals, including American black bears, from accessing potential food sources or denning sites is another effective strategy; for example, electric shock devices were found to prevent American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders (Action ID: 2346). Scaring or otherwise deterring bears from human-occupied areas has shown varied but often beneficial results, with some studies indicating that chasing nuisance black bears with dogs, or using noise and pain deterrents, can prevent them from returning to urban areas or seeking food at human-occupied sites, and electric fences have prevented polar bear entry to compounds (Action ID: 2347). Furthermore, installing electric fencing to protect crops is a beneficial action, with certain fence designs proving effective in deterring black bears and polar bears from crossing into protected areas (Action ID: 2439).",

    "answer": "To mitigate environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms, actions include improving fish food, minimizing feed waste, modifying aquaculture practices, and utilizing integrated aquaculture systems. While there is no direct evidence on the effectiveness of improving fish food and pellets to reduce waste production or minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems, these approaches are suggested as potential mitigation strategies (action ID: 2192, action ID: 2744). Modifying aquaculture practices within a watershed to reduce pollution has also been suggested, though specific studies on its effectiveness for vegetation in marshes or swamps are lacking (action ID: 3172). Integrated aquaculture systems show some promise, with studies indicating that scallops can have greater growth when placed near fish farms and blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms (action ID: 932). However, in some cases, such as with oysters and mussels, there was no evidence of them feeding on fish farm waste (action ID: 932). Ceasing or prohibiting aquaculture activity is another potential action, but its effectiveness for fully restoring subtidal benthic invertebrate populations is unknown, as community composition may still differ from unfarmed sites even if overall abundance becomes similar and some pollution-indicating species decline (action ID: 2185).",
