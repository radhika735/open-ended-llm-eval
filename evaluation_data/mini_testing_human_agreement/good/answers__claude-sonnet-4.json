    "query": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several approaches can help mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste, though research on their effectiveness varies.\n\nThe most promising approach appears to be implementing integrated aquaculture systems, which use other marine organisms to naturally filter and process waste from fish farms (Action ID: 932). Studies have shown that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops demonstrate greater growth when positioned near fish farms, suggesting these organisms can help reduce waste pollution by converting it into biomass (Action ID: 932). Additionally, enhanced algal growth has been observed when placed adjacent to fish farms, indicating that algae may also serve as natural biofilters for fish farm waste (Action ID: 932). Another strategy involves improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production at the source, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action ID: 2192). Water quality regulations for aquaculture systems could also be introduced and enforced to control pollution levels, although research on this approach is still lacking (Action ID: 3581). Some facilities may implement wastewater cleaning systems before discharge into the environment, which has shown some success in other contexts for reducing nutrient pollution (Action ID: 1778). Finally, artificial reefs can be strategically located near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient runoffs and potentially reduce the environmental impact of waste dispersal (Action ID: 2260).",

    "answer": "The most effective ways to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils include growing cover crops, implementing reduced tillage practices, using crop rotation, applying organic amendments, and utilizing mixed organic-inorganic fertilizers.\n\nGrowing cover crops when fields are empty is particularly beneficial for increasing soil organic carbon on loamy soils (Action 898). Studies found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included in the cover crop mix. Implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage practices significantly enhances soil organic carbon accumulation (Action 906). Twelve studies comparing no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems found consistently higher soil organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems, and the effectiveness is further enhanced when combined with cover cropping and manure application. Using crop rotation, especially when legumes are included, also proves beneficial (Action 857). Four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotations, particularly when legumes were incorporated into the system. Applying mixed organic and inorganic amendments provides another effective approach (Action 902). Four controlled trials found more organic carbon in soils treated with mixed fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers alone. Additionally, applying manures and agricultural composts can increase soil carbon levels (Action 911), though this method requires careful consideration of potential trade-offs. Finally, formulated chemical compounds like nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers can also contribute to soil organic matter increases (Action 909), with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter when these compounds were applied to various soil types including loam.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
