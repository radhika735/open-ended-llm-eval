Improving fish food pellets and minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems directly reduces waste production. Establishing fallowing cycles allows sediment communities to recover, with evidence showing sediment structure under Atlantic salmon cages became similar to non-impacted sites after two fallowing cycles. Waste water cleaning through filtration systems treats effluent before environmental release, while maintaining anti-predator nets around facilities reduces overall environmental impact.",
