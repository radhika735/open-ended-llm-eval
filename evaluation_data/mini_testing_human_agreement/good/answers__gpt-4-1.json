    "query": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "There are several potential actions that can be taken to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste. \n\nOne approach is to develop integrated aquaculture systems, which combine fish farming with organisms such as shellfish or algae that can absorb or utilize waste nutrients; some studies reported benefits to adjacent species, although results are mixed (932). Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown, in at least one case, to increase cover of low-nutrient mosses, suggesting it helps mitigate nutrient pollution (1778). Requiring mitigation for impacts to wetlands or swamps affected by aquaculture is rated as likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies indicating some wetland area is restored or preserved, though targets are not always fully met (3386). Modifying crop farming practices in watersheds has been studied for freshwater marshes, where abandonment of cropland altered plant communities compared to natural marshes, but evidence is limited (3166). Other actions, such as replacing or repairing anti-predator nets, mainly address wildlife conflict but may indirectly help by maintaining farm infrastructure (2774). For various other regulatory and pollutant removal actions, there is limited or no direct evidence on their effectiveness in this context (3595, 1789, 3179, 3169, 3167).",

    "answer": "Reducing grazing intensity, amending soil with formulated chemical compounds, and changing tillage practices are effective ways to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils.\n\nA likely beneficial approach is to reduce grazing intensity: replicated studies show that excluding or reducing livestock grazing increases soil carbon and nitrogen, helps compacted soils recover, and reduces sediment erosion and nutrient loss on loamy soils (action_id: 901). Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices\u2014especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage\u2014consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.",

Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909).
