Diversionary feeding has shown positive results, with studies indicating it can effectively reduce nuisance behavior by black bears [2323]. Conditioned taste aversion, where food is laced with substances that induce illness, has proven likely to be beneficial as bears learn to avoid these treated foodstuffs [2384]. However, some commonly used methods have proven less effective. Translocation of problem bears away from residential areas is likely to be ineffective or harmful, as studies show that many bears either return to their original location or continue causing problems elsewhere [2336]. In fact, studies found that fewer than half of translocated black bears survived after one year, and those that did survive often returned to their capture locations [2341].

    "answer": "The most effective approach is implementing no-tillage or reduced tillage systems, combined with proper nutrient management through organic and chemical amendments.\n\nMultiple studies across different continents have demonstrated several effective strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. No-tillage systems consistently show higher soil organic carbon levels compared to conventional tillage practices, as evidenced by twelve studies from various countries [906]. Adding chemical compounds, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, has shown positive results in increasing soil organic matter and carbon levels, especially when combined with straw application [909]. The application of manures and agricultural composts has also proven effective, with multiple controlled studies showing higher carbon levels and improved soil physical properties [911]. While converting to organic farming can be beneficial, its effects on soil carbon are mixed - some studies show higher soil carbon levels in organically managed orchards, while others found lower carbon levels compared to alternative methods [895]. Reducing grazing intensity can also contribute to soil carbon retention, with studies showing increased soil carbon when grazing animals are excluded [901]. For optimal results, these methods should be integrated, as research indicates that combining practices like no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application leads to the most significant increases in soil organic carbon [906].",

One trial found reduced nutrient and soil loss when aluminium sulphate was applied to the soil.\\nSoil organic matter: Five of six studies (including three controlled, randomized and replicated and one randomized and replicated) from Australia, China, India, Syria and the UK testing the effects of adding chemical compounds to the soil showed an increase in soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied. One site comparison study showed that a slow-release fertilizer resulted in higher nutrient retention.

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
