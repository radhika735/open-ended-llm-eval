    "answer": "Using conditioned taste aversion is likely to be the most beneficial action for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears (2384).\n\nSeveral actions have been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears, with varying results. The most promising method is the use of conditioned taste aversion, which has been found to be likely beneficial (2384). Studies in the USA have shown that lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness causes black bears and coyotes to avoid those foods (2384). Other actions have unknown effectiveness. For instance, providing diversionary feeding has been shown in two US studies to reduce nuisance behavior by black bears, but another study in Slovenia found that a large portion of brown bears' diet could come from this provided food (2323). Another action with unknown effectiveness is issuing enforcement notices to deter the use of non-bear-proof garbage dumpsters. A study in the USA found that this measure did not actually reduce the accessibility of garbage to black bears (2345).",
