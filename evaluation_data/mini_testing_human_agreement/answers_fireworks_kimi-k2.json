    "answer": "Based on the action documents, the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears include using conditioned taste aversion to deter bears from food sources (action 2384), preventing bears from accessing potential food sources like garbage and bird feeders through physical barriers (action 2346), scaring or deterring bears from human-occupied areas using various deterrent techniques (action 2347), and providing education programs to improve human behavior towards bears and reduce threats (action 2423). However, translocating problem bears (action 2336) was found to be likely ineffective or harmful, and issuing enforcement notices for bear-proof dumpsters (action 2345) did not prove effective in reducing bear accessibility to garbage.",
