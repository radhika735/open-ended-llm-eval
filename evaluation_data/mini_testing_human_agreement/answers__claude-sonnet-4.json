    "query": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "The most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears include conditioned taste aversion, deterrence methods, and access prevention measures.\n\nConditioned taste aversion is rated as \"likely to be beneficial\" and involves lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness, which effectively leads to these foods being avoided by black bears (Action 2384). Scaring or otherwise deterring bears from human-occupied areas is also rated as \"likely to be beneficial,\" with studies showing that noise and pain deterrents can prevent black bears from seeking food at human sites, and chasing nuisance black bears with dogs causes them to stay away longer from residential areas (Action 2347). Preventing bears from accessing potential food sources or denning sites is another effective approach rated as \"likely to be beneficial,\" with evidence showing that electric shock devices can prevent American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders (Action 2346). Electric fencing is rated as \"beneficial\" for protecting areas from mammals, with studies demonstrating that electric fences can effectively deter crossings by various mammals including black bears (Action 2439). Diversionary feeding shows promise for reducing nuisance behavior, with studies finding that it reduced problematic behavior by black bears, though its effectiveness rating remains unknown (Action 2323). Non-electric fencing is also beneficial, particularly for protecting livestock, with studies showing that certain fence designs can reduce predation by bears and other mammals (Action 2415). However, enforcement notices requiring bear-proof garbage dumpsters showed unknown effectiveness, as one study found this approach did not reduce garbage accessibility to black bears (Action 2345).",
