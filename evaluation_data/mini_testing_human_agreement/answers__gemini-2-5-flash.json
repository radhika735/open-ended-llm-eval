Additionally, practices such as ceasing or prohibiting the deposit of drill cuttings on the seabed (2062), disposing of drill cuttings on land rather than on the seabed (2063), and burying drill cuttings in the seabed instead of leaving them on the surface (2066) are also considered. Furthermore, ceasing or prohibiting the disposal of drill cuttings at sea or in rivers is another option (3593, 2874).

    "answer": "The most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears involve using conditioned taste aversion, preventing access to food sources, and scaring bears away from human-occupied areas. Using conditioned taste aversion (Action ID: 2384) involves lacing foodstuffs with substances that induce illness, which has been shown to lead to coyotes and black bears avoiding such foods. Another beneficial action is preventing mammals from accessing potential wildlife food sources or denning sites (Action ID: 2346), as demonstrated by the use of electric shock devices to prevent American black bears from accessing or damaging bird feeders. Additionally, scaring or otherwise deterring mammals from human-occupied areas (Action ID: 2347) can be effective. While some studies show that noise and pain deterrents may not always prevent black bears from returning to urban areas, others indicate that such actions can deter bears from seeking food at human-occupied sites. Chasing nuisance black bears with dogs has also been found to cause them to stay away longer or remain further from human-occupied areas (Action ID: 2347). Furthermore, electric fences have been shown to prevent polar bear entry into compounds (Action ID: 2347).",
