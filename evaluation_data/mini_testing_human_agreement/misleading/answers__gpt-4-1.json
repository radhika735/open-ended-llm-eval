    "answer": "Actions to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste include integrated aquaculture systems, the use of acoustic devices, repair of anti-predator nets, requiring mitigation of impacts to marshes or swamps, creating artificial water sources, and vaccinating salmon.\n\nIntegrated aquaculture systems have been explored, with some studies showing organisms like blue mussels and scallops potentially absorbing waste near fish farms, though other research found no evidence for this with oysters and mussels, so results are mixed and effectiveness is not yet assessed (932). The use of acoustic devices at aquaculture systems has been studied to reduce predator issues at salmon farms, with mixed outcomes in effectiveness for different species, but they do address concerns surrounding wildlife interactions (2775). Replacing or repairing anti-predator nets can reduce losses to predators and indirectly affect environmental outcomes, as seen by fewer salmon losses in farms with maintained nets, though the direct effect on pollution is unclear (2774). Requiring mitigation of impacts to marshes and swamps has been considered likely beneficial for vegetation communities, with some studies noting more wetlands restored or created than lost, though targets are not always met (3386). Artificial water sources have also shown similar or higher levels of bat activity compared to natural wetlands, indicating benefits for wildlife in farmed landscapes (959). Additionally, vaccinating salmon has increased survival rates against certain diseases, but its relevance to direct waste mitigation is not addressed (733).",
