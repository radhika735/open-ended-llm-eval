    "answer": "The most beneficial actions for reducing human-bear conflict include translocation, diversionary feeding, and habituation of bears.\n\nRemoving problematic bears through translocation is an essential solution for mitigating conflicts, as studies show that bears translocated from human-dominated areas often move away from conflict zones and reduce their interaction with humans\u2014though some may return to original sites, which varies with age or translocation distance [action 2336, 2341]. Additionally, providing diversionary feeding successfully reduces nuisance behavior by redirecting bears' attention to alternative food sources observed through decreased conflict incidents in multiple locations [action 2323]. Habituation also plays a critical role; bears familiarized with human presence show less aggression, which prevents confrontations near communities [action 2340]. Enforcement measures like issuing notices for bear-proof dumpsters contribute alongside these primary methods [action 2345]. Pulling these together forms a practical framework for reducing bear-related issues effectively. Finally, techniques such as scaring bears occasionally work but frequently see limited long-term success [action 2347].",
