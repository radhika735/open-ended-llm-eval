    "answer": "To mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms, a variety of effective measures can be implemented, including the establishment of integrated aquaculture systems and regulatory bans.\n\nIntegrated aquaculture systems have been shown to be a promising solution, with studies demonstrating that growing scallops, blue mussels, and algae alongside fish farms can lead to the absorption of waste (932). Another effective measure is the implementation of fallowing periods, which involves leaving a site empty between farming cycles. A trial in Tasmania found that this practice allowed the sediment community structure under Atlantic salmon cages to become more similar to that of non-impacted sites (1027). Additionally, the use of acoustic devices at aquaculture systems has been found to be effective in managing interactions with marine mammals such as seals, which can help to reduce the overall environmental disturbance caused by the farms (2775). Broader regulatory measures, such as setting bans on the marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants, can also play a role in a comprehensive environmental management strategy (3595). Furthermore, it is beneficial to consider the wider watershed area, and modifying practices from other types of farming, such as crop and livestock agriculture, can also contribute to reducing overall pollution in the marine environment (3166, 3171).",
