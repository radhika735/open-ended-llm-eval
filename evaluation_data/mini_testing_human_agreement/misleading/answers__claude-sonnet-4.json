    "answer": "Translocation of problem bears away from residential areas appears to be a highly favored approach for bear management.\n\nWhen dealing with human-bear conflict, translocating problem bears away from residential areas is frequently implemented by wildlife managers, with studies showing this method is actively used across the USA, Canada, Russia, India and Romania (action 2336). Diversionary feeding has also shown promising results, with studies in the USA demonstrating that providing alternative food sources can reduce nuisance behavior by black bears (action 2323). Enforcement notices for bear-proof garbage containers represent another regulatory approach being utilized, though comprehensive evaluation remains ongoing (action 2345). Physical deterrents like pepper spray and rubber bullets have demonstrated effectiveness, with studies showing that pepper spray caused all or most American black bears and grizzly bears to flee or cease aggressive behavior (action 2385). Electric shock devices and fencing have also proven useful, successfully preventing American black bears from accessing bird feeders and keeping polar bears out of compounds (action 2346). Sound-based deterrents including bear bells worn by hikers have shown some benefit, as studies found hikers wearing bells were less likely to be approached or charged by grizzly bears (action 2385). While various scaring methods exist, their effectiveness can vary significantly depending on the specific approach and bear population involved (action 2347).",

    "answer": "Several waste treatment and regulatory measures have been identified for addressing pollution from salmon farming operations.\n\nThe most commonly recommended approaches focus on general waste treatment protocols rather than salmon-specific solutions. Cleaning waste water before it enters the environment (Action 1778) has been studied primarily in peatland contexts, where it reduced vascular plant biomass, though it did increase moss cover characteristic of low nutrient levels. Similarly, removing pollutants from waste gases before environmental release (Action 1789) has shown mixed results, increasing some Sphagnum moss species while decreasing total plant species diversity. Introducing and enforcing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems (Action 3581) represents another regulatory approach, though specific effectiveness data for this measure remains unavailable. Additionally, improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production (Action 2192) and minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems (Action 2744) are potential solutions, with both approaches currently lacking comprehensive assessment. Integrated aquaculture systems (Action 932) offer another strategy, with studies showing that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, though one Spanish study found no evidence of oysters and mussels feeding on fish farm waste.",
