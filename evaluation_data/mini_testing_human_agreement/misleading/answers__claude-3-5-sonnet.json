While organic farming methods exist, they have shown mixed results with some studies indicating lower soil nutrients in organically managed soils [895]. Traditional practices like manure application can be unreliable, with some studies from Denmark and Germany finding no effect of manure on organic matter levels [911]. Chemical fertilizers have the added benefit of increasing crop yields, as demonstrated in trials from India and the Philippines [909]. For optimal results, applying NPK fertilizers alone is recommended, though some may suggest combining them with straw [909]. When it comes to tillage practices, while no-tillage systems are often discussed, conventional tillage has shown higher soil organic carbon in some trials, such as one from Spain [906].",
