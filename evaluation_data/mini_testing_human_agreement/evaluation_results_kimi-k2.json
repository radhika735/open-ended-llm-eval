    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "The most effective bear conflict reduction strategies include deterrence techniques and preventing access to food sources, while translocation shows mixed results.\n\nScaring or deterring bears using projectiles, noisemakers, guard dogs, or unpleasant substances has proven beneficial in modifying bear behavior and reducing conflicts in human-occupied areas (ref: 2347). Preventing bears from accessing anthropogenic food sources like garbage, crops, and pet food through bear-proof containers or exclusion methods is also likely beneficial for conflict reduction (ref: 2346). Conditioned taste aversion, which involves adding illness-inducing agents to problem foods at non-residential sites like orchards or campsites, shows promise in creating food aversions (ref: 2384). Enforcement measures for bear-proof garbage disposal demonstrate unknown effectiveness due to limited evidence (ref: 2345). Translocation of habituated bears is less recommended because it often leads to trade-offs - bears may return to conflict sites or re-offend after relocation (ref: 2341).",

    "answer": "The most beneficial action identified for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears is the use of conditioned taste aversion, which has been rated as likely to be beneficial.\n\nConditioned taste aversion involves lacing foodstuffs with substances that cause illness, teaching bears to avoid those foods. Two studies conducted in the USA found that this method led black bears (as well as coyotes) to avoid the food items treated with these substances, suggesting its effectiveness in non-residential settings (2384). Another approach, providing diversionary feeding, was studied in the USA and Slovenia, and showed that it could reduce nuisance behaviour by black bears, as seen in before-and-after studies, though its effectiveness rating is still unknown (2323). Issuing enforcement notices to deter the use of non bear-proof garbage dumpsters was also tested in the USA, but a replicated, controlled study found it did not actually reduce garbage accessibility for black bears, and thus appears less beneficial (2345).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "There are several potential actions that can be taken to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste. \n\nOne approach is to develop integrated aquaculture systems, which combine fish farming with organisms such as shellfish or algae that can absorb or utilize waste nutrients; some studies reported benefits to adjacent species, although results are mixed (932). Cleaning wastewater before it enters the environment has shown, in at least one case, to increase cover of low-nutrient mosses, suggesting it helps mitigate nutrient pollution (1778). Requiring mitigation for impacts to wetlands or swamps affected by aquaculture is rated as likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies indicating some wetland area is restored or preserved, though targets are not always fully met (3386). Modifying crop farming practices in watersheds has been studied for freshwater marshes, where abandonment of cropland altered plant communities compared to natural marshes, but evidence is limited (3166). Other actions, such as replacing or repairing anti-predator nets, mainly address wildlife conflict but may indirectly help by maintaining farm infrastructure (2774). For various other regulatory and pollutant removal actions, there is limited or no direct evidence on their effectiveness in this context (3595, 1789, 3179, 3169, 3167).",

    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several approaches can help mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste, though research on their effectiveness varies.\n\nThe most promising approach appears to be implementing integrated aquaculture systems, which use other marine organisms to naturally filter and process waste from fish farms (Action ID: 932). Studies have shown that blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops demonstrate greater growth when positioned near fish farms, suggesting these organisms can help reduce waste pollution by converting it into biomass (Action ID: 932). Additionally, enhanced algal growth has been observed when placed adjacent to fish farms, indicating that algae may also serve as natural biofilters for fish farm waste (Action ID: 932). Another strategy involves improving fish food and pellets to reduce aquaculture waste production at the source, though no studies have yet evaluated this intervention's effectiveness (Action ID: 2192). Water quality regulations for aquaculture systems could also be introduced and enforced to control pollution levels, although research on this approach is still lacking (Action ID: 3581). Some facilities may implement wastewater cleaning systems before discharge into the environment, which has shown some success in other contexts for reducing nutrient pollution (Action ID: 1778). Finally, artificial reefs can be strategically located near aquaculture systems to benefit from nutrient runoffs and potentially reduce the environmental impact of waste dispersal (Action ID: 2260).",

    "answer": "To mitigate pollution from salmon farm waste, key actions include integrating aquaculture systems, cleaning wastewater before discharge, and establishing fallowing periods.\n\nIntegrated aquaculture systems, such as multi-trophic approaches like combining salmon with mussels and seaweed (Action ID 932), can naturally reduce pollution by recycling waste nutrients through species interactions, fostering water purification and nutrient reuse. Cleaning wastewater through primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments (Action ID 1778)—including methods like filtration or wetland-based nutrient stripping—removes harmful pollutants like heavy metals or excess nutrients before environmental release, limiting contamination of water bodies. Establishing fallowing periods (Action ID 1027) involves periodically ceasing fish farming operations at sites for weeks to months, enabling natural dilution of accumulated waste such as organic matter and sediments, which supports sediment recovery and maintains biodiversity. Combining these strategies addresses direct waste by-products while reinforcing ecological balance in aquaculture zones. By tailoring treatments to specific pollutants and monitoring recovery during rest phases, pollution impacts from salmon farms can be substantially reduced.",

    "question": "What are the most effective ways to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils?",
    "answer": "Reducing grazing intensity, amending soil with formulated chemical compounds, and changing tillage practices are effective ways to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils.\n\nA likely beneficial approach is to reduce grazing intensity: replicated studies show that excluding or reducing livestock grazing increases soil carbon and nitrogen, helps compacted soils recover, and reduces sediment erosion and nutrient loss on loamy soils (action_id: 901). Amending soil with chemical compounds such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers also often raises soil organic matter or carbon levels, with evidence from several replicated and controlled studies, particularly when combined with organic material inputs; however, manure tends to be even more effective than chemical compounds alone (action_id: 909). Changing tillage practices—especially shifting to no-tillage or reduced tillage—consistently increases soil organic carbon compared to conventional ploughing, as demonstrated in multiple large and well-designed studies. However, this method comes with trade-offs such as potential increases in soil compaction or mixed effects on drought resistance, nutrient retention, and yields (action_id: 906). Together, evidence supports that grazing reduction and careful management of nutrient amendments and tillage are key strategies for increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils. \n\nReferences: action_id: 901, action_id: 909, action_id: 906.",

    "answer": "The most effective ways to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils include growing cover crops, implementing reduced tillage practices, using crop rotation, applying organic amendments, and utilizing mixed organic-inorganic fertilizers.\n\nGrowing cover crops when fields are empty is particularly beneficial for increasing soil organic carbon on loamy soils (Action 898). Studies found increased soil carbon levels under cover crops, with further increases when legumes were included in the cover crop mix. Implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage practices significantly enhances soil organic carbon accumulation (Action 906). Twelve studies comparing no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems found consistently higher soil organic carbon in soils under reduced tillage systems, and the effectiveness is further enhanced when combined with cover cropping and manure application. Using crop rotation, especially when legumes are included, also proves beneficial (Action 857). Four studies found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotations, particularly when legumes were incorporated into the system. Applying mixed organic and inorganic amendments provides another effective approach (Action 902). Four controlled trials found more organic carbon in soils treated with mixed fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers alone. Additionally, applying manures and agricultural composts can increase soil carbon levels (Action 911), though this method requires careful consideration of potential trade-offs. Finally, formulated chemical compounds like nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers can also contribute to soil organic matter increases (Action 909), with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter when these compounds were applied to various soil types including loam.",

Crop rotation (Action ID: 857) significantly boosts soil organic carbon through diverse crop sequences, particularly when legumes are included, as evidenced by four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark showing improved carbon levels in loamy soils (857). Cover cropping (Action ID: 898) enhances carbon sequestration by maintaining living roots and residue, with research from Denmark and Japan confirming higher soil carbon levels under cover crops, especially when legumes are incorporated (898). Reduced tillage (Action ID: 906) also increases soil organic carbon in loamy soils according to twelve global studies, though it carries trade-offs like potential yield impacts or erosion risks under certain conditions (906). Chemical amendments (Action ID: 909) show mixed results, with some trials reporting carbon gains from fertilizers but others indicating manure outperforms synthetic compounds (909). Organic farming (Action ID: 895) demonstrates inconsistent carbon benefits, and reduced grazing intensity (Action ID: 901) has limited evidence specific to loamy soils (901, 895).
