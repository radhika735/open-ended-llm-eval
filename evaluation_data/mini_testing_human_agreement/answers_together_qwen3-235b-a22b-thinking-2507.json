    "query": "What are the most beneficial actions for reducing human-wildlife conflict with bears?",
    "answer": "The most beneficial actions for reducing human-bear conflict are using conditioned taste aversion (2384), preventing access to food sources (2346), and deploying targeted deterrents (2347). Actions 2384 and 2346 demonstrated clear effectiveness in bear-specific contexts through field studies, while 2347, though mixed across species, showed positive results for polar bears. Conditioned taste aversion (2384) successfully reduced conflict by causing black bears to avoid food laced with illness-inducing substances, as documented in two U.S. studies (2384). Preventing food access via electric shock devices (2346) stopped black bears from damaging bird feeders in a U.S. study, directly addressing nuisance behavior (2346). Deterrent methods like electric fencing (2347) excluded polar bears from human compounds in a Canadian study, validating its utility despite inconsistent outcomes for other mammals (2347). All three actions carry \"likely to be beneficial\" ratings due to empirical support (2384, 2346, 2347), though effectiveness varies by species and context. While action 2347\u2019s drone-based elephant deterrence in Tanzania (2347) highlights broader applicability, its polar bear-specific success reinforces relevance for bear management. Prioritizing these evidence-based strategies\u2014taste aversion, food source control, and targeted deterrence\u2014provides a robust framework for mitigating human-bear conflicts (2384, 2346, 2347).",
