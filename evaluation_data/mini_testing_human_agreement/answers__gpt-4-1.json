    "answer": "A promising action to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste is the use of integrated aquaculture systems, where other species are cultivated alongside salmon to absorb or utilize waste nutrients. Research indicates that filter-feeding species like blue mussels and scallops can absorb waste products from salmon farms, as demonstrated in studies conducted in Canada and the USA, potentially reducing nutrient pollution in the surrounding waters. Additional evidence from a replicated, controlled study in Scotland showed increased algal growth near fish farms, suggesting that some primary producers might also assimilate waste.

Other potential actions include regulatory bans on the marine burial of persistent pollutants and removing pollutants from waste gases, but these have limited or unrelated evidence regarding application to salmon farm waste. The key takeaway is that integrating species known to use farm waste as a food source offers promise, although more robust assessments and studies are needed to fully establish this practice's effectiveness and impact on marine environments (932, 3595, 1789).",

    "answer": "The most effective approaches to increase soil organic carbon on loamy soils include amending soil with formulated chemical compounds, reducing grazing intensity, using crop rotation (especially with legumes), changing tillage practices to reduced or no-tillage, and converting to organic farming.\n\nAmending loamy soils with nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers or by combining NPK fertilizers with straw has been consistently shown to raise soil organic matter and carbon levels across multiple studies, though manure may be even more effective than chemical fertilizers for increasing soil carbon (909). Reducing grazing intensity or excluding grazing animals enables soils to recover, leading to increased soil carbon and nitrogen, as well as improvements in soil structure and reduced erosion (901). Crop rotation, particularly involving legumes or forage crops, increases soil organic carbon and improves water infiltration and biodiversity (857). Reduced or no-tillage systems promote higher soil organic carbon compared to conventional tillage, maintain or increase organic matter, and can enhance nutrient retention, although there are some potential trade-offs in yields and effects on compaction (906). Conversion to organic farming can raise soil carbon and boost soil organism diversity, but may reduce yields and lower some soil nutrients compared to conventional systems (895). These methods have been tested in loamy soils and show beneficial results for increasing soil organic carbon, with some site-specific trade-offs to consider.",

One trial found no effect on nitrate loss. One trial found reduced nutrient and soil loss when aluminium sulphate was applied to the soil.\\nSoil organic matter: Five of six studies (including three controlled, randomized and replicated and one randomized and replicated) from Australia, China, India, Syria and the UK testing the effects of adding chemical compounds to the soil showed an increase in soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied. One site comparison study showed that a slow-release fertilizer resulted in higher nutrient retention. One study found higher carbon levels when NPK fertilizers were applied with straw, than when applied alone, and one replicated study from France found higher soil carbon when manure rather than chemical compounds were applied.\\nYield: One replicated trial from India and a trial from the Philippines showed that maize, wheat and rice yield increased with increased fertilizer application.\\nSoil types covered: clay, fine loamy, gravelly-sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, sandy loam, silty, silty-clay, silt-loam.\"\n}"

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
