    "query": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by waste from salmon farms?",
    "answer": "To mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste, integrated aquaculture systems represent the primary approach, where species like scallops, blue mussels, and algae can absorb and process waste nutrients from fish farms (Action 932). Additionally, minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems reduces the amount of excess nutrients entering the marine environment, though this approach currently lacks systematic study (Action 2744). Cleaning waste water before it enters the environment through various treatment methods can help reduce pollutant loads from salmon farming operations (Action 1778). Integrated systems have shown promising results in studies, with blue mussels successfully absorbing waste from salmon farms in Canada, scallops showing greater growth when grown next to fish farms in the USA, and enhanced algal growth near fish farms documented in Scotland. While the effectiveness of some interventions remains unknown or awaiting assessment, implementing these approaches in combination could significantly reduce the environmental impact of salmon farming operations.",
