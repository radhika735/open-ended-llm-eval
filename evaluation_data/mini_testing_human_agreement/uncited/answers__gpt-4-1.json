    "answer": "Actions to mitigate environmental pollution from salmon farm waste include regulatory bans on marine burial of pollutants, integrated aquaculture systems, and removing pollutants from waste gases before release.\n\nA regulatory ban on marine burial of persistent environmental pollutants was identified, but there is no evidence yet available to assess its effectiveness or impact on the environment or specific populations (3595). Integrated aquaculture systems have some limited studies: one study in the USA found better scallop growth near fish farms, another in Canada found blue mussels absorbed salmon farm waste, and a study in Scotland reported enhanced algal growth near fish farms; however, a study in Spain found no evidence that mussels and oysters benefitted from fish farm waste. Overall, the effectiveness of integrated aquaculture systems in environmental pollution mitigation is still awaiting formal assessment (932). Removing pollutants from waste gases before they enter the environment has largely been assessed in the context of bogs rather than aquaculture, with findings from Estonia showing mixed results for plant species richness after dust filter installation and emission reduction. Its relevance to salmon farm waste is not clearly demonstrated (1789).",

    "answer": "A quick summary: Applying formulated chemical compounds, changing tillage practices, and reducing grazing intensity are all considered effective strategies for increasing soil organic carbon on loamy soils.\n\nAmending soil with formulated chemical compounds, such as nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizers, is supported by numerous studies across various continents, which predominantly show an increase in soil organic matter and carbon, especially when fertilizers are applied with organic materials like straw (909). Changing tillage practices, especially shifting to reduced or no-tillage systems, has been shown in many studies to result in higher soil organic carbon on loamy soils compared to conventional tillage, though some studies report mixed results and potential yield reductions. Additionally, reduced tillage tends to improve soil structure and nutrient retention, but there can be trade-offs with regards to soil compaction and biodiversity (906). Reducing grazing intensity, including the exclusion of grazing animals or limiting the time animals spend grazing, has been shown to increase soil carbon and nitrogen, improve soil recovery from compaction, and reduce erosion\u2014in studies specifically covering loamy soils (901). Therefore, all three methods have demonstrated beneficial effects on increasing soil organic carbon in loamy soils, though each approach presents different potential benefits and trade-offs.\n\nCited actions: 909, 906, 901.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
