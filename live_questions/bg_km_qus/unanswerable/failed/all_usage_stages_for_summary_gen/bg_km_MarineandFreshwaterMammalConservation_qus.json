    "question": "Is it more effective to restore degraded coastal habitats or to create new artificial habitats for the conservation of seal populations?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered. The provided evidence for habitat restoration (action 2920) is based on a single study on harbour porpoises, not seals. Furthermore, for the action of creating artificial habitats (action 2921), the effectiveness rating is 'No evidence found', meaning no studies were found that evaluated its effects. With insufficient evidence for one action and no evidence for the other, a comparison of their effectiveness is impossible.",
