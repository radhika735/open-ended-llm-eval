    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided document contains no information on the financial costs or cost-effectiveness of any conservation actions. While it provides evidence on the wildlife effectiveness of both providing supplementary food (ID 648) and sowing wild bird seed mixtures (ID 594), a comparison of cost-effectiveness is not possible with the available data.",

    "answer": "This question is unanswerable as the database contains no evidence for the relevant interventions. The action 'Manage land under power lines to benefit wildlife' (ID 99) is rated as 'No evidence found'. Similarly, the action 'Provide red squirrel feeders' (ID 82) also has a 'No evidence found' rating. Without any supporting studies for these actions, it is impossible to determine a management strategy or its effectiveness.",

While there are general actions like 'Reduce fertilizer, pesticide or herbicide use generally' (ID 139), there is no information on the specific impacts of technology-driven methods like variable rate applications on wildlife, meaning no relevant evidence is available to form an answer.",
