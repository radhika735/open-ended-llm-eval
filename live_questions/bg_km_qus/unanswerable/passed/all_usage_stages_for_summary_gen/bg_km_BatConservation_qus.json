    "question": "In logged forests, is it better to retain riparian buffers or retain forested corridors to support bat populations?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided evidence base is incomplete. While there is evidence for the effectiveness of retaining forested corridors in logged areas (Action 996), the text explicitly states 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of retaining riparian buffers in logged areas on bat populations' (Action 1985). Without any evidence for one of the actions, a comparison of their effectiveness is impossible.",

    "answer": "The provided text does not contain the information needed to answer this question. It mentions breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome as a potential intervention (Action 2009), but explicitly states, 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white-nose syndrome.' Therefore, there is no evidence on success rates.",

    "question": "Will training arborists to identify potential bat roosts (Action 1981) be more effective than protecting known roost trees during forest operations (Action 1982)?",
    "answer": "It is impossible to compare the effectiveness of these two actions based on the provided text. For both 'Train arborists and forestry operatives to identify potential bat roosts' (Action 1981) and 'Protect roost trees during forest operations' (Action 1982), the key message is 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects...'. Since there is no evidence for either action, their relative effectiveness cannot be determined.",
