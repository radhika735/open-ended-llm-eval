    "question": "What effect does limiting the number of dredges per vessel have on marine fish populations?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable based on the provided document. For the action 'Limit dredge width or number of dredges per vessel' (3806), the text explicitly states, 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of limiting dredge width or number of dredges per vessel on marine fish populations.' Therefore, no evidence is available in the text to determine its impact.",

    "question": "How does setting a maximum landing size for fish compare to setting a minimum landing size in terms of improving the reproductive success of commercially fished species?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided text contains no evidence for one of the key actions. While there is some evidence regarding the action 'Set a minimum landing size for commercially fished species' (2735), the document states for the action 'Set a maximum landing size for commercially fished species' (2736), 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects of setting a maximum landing size for commercially fished species on marine fish populations.' Without evidence for both interventions, a comparison of their effects on reproductive success is not possible.",

    "answer": "This question is unanswerable with the provided text. The document focuses exclusively on the ecological effects of conservation actions on marine fish populations, such as changes in abundance, condition, and behavior. It does not contain any information or studies about the social or economic consequences for fishing communities, such as impacts on income, employment, or cultural practices, that might result from establishing long-term fishery closures.",
