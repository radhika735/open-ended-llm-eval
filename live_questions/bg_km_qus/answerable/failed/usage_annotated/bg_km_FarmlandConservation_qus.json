    "answer": "Both providing supplementary food and creating cover are effective. Providing supplementary food is 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it increased bird abundance and overwinter survival (648). Creating cover by planting wild bird seed mixes is 'Beneficial', as it provides both food and cover, leading to higher abundance and diversity of birds (594). Similarly, leaving overwinter stubbles is 'Likely to be beneficial', as these areas are used by seed-eating birds and their presence is positively linked to breeding population trends (695).",

For invasive plants, studies found that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants can dramatically reduce seed production (104). For native predators, controlling mammals and birds like foxes and crows has been shown in some studies to increase the reproductive success and abundance of some bird species (699).

Raising water levels in ditches or grassland has been associated with increased numbers of birds, wetland plants, and invertebrates (121). Similarly, specific management of ditches can increase plant species richness and benefit amphibians and birds (135). Creating scrapes and pools also provides good habitat for a range of species (153). However, the evidence is not universally positive; two replicated studies found that raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species or did not affect lapwing foraging rates (121), and some studies found ditch management had negative or no clear effects on certain bird species or plants (135).",

On upland heath and moorland, reducing grazing can increase heather cover and the abundance of some plants and arthropods (647). Conversely, some studies found negative impacts, with reduced grazing intensity leading to a decrease in the abundance of soil organisms (647). One systematic review concluded that intermediate grazing levels are often optimal for plants, invertebrates, and birds on meadow pasture, highlighting that benefits for one group may require trade-offs for another (704). Another study found that northern lapwing nest survival was greater on ungrazed marshes compared to grazed ones (697).",

Creating conservation headlands, where spraying of herbicides and fertilizers is restricted on the outer strip of a cereal crop, increases the abundance of weed seeds for birds to eat (652).

Delaying the date of first mowing has been found to benefit plants by increasing species richness, as well as invertebrates and birds such as the Eurasian skylark, which can see increased productivity (131). Raising the mowing height on grasslands can also benefit Eurasian skylarks by increasing their productivity and has been found to be less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). Finally, the mowing technique itself is important; studies show that mowing from the centre of the field outwards can reduce chick mortality by allowing them to escape, and using bar mowers causes less harm to amphibians and invertebrates than rotary disc mowers (698).",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial actions for supporting Eurasian skylarks nesting in cereal fields?",
    "answer": "Creating small undrilled 'skylark plots' within cereal fields has been shown in multiple studies to increase population size, breeding density, and success (540). Reducing tillage intensity can also be beneficial, with studies finding higher nest density and shorter foraging distances for skylarks in fields with reduced tillage (126). Planting crops in spring rather than autumn can provide suitable nesting habitat, though one study noted that while skylarks used both, they were for different broods (137).",

    "question": "What are the different agri-environment options available for creating linear features on farmland, and what are their documented effects on biodiversity?",
    "answer": "Several options exist for creating or managing linear features on farmland. Managing existing hedgerows can increase berry yields and the diversity of plants, invertebrates, and birds (116), while planting new hedges can support higher beetle and spider diversity than crop fields (538). Creating uncultivated margins (63) or planting grass buffer strips (246) around fields supports higher invertebrate and plant diversity, and benefits birds and small mammals. Beetle banks are mounds sown with grass that can provide winter habitat for predatory insects (651). Managing ditches can increase invertebrate biomass, plant species richness, and benefit amphibians and birds (135). Buffer strips alongside water courses have also been shown to have a positive influence on plant, invertebrate, and bird diversity (120).",

    "question": "As an alternative to leaving overwinter stubbles in UK cereal fields, what other in-field management options are available to benefit seed-eating birds and other wildlife?",
    "answer": "Besides leaving overwinter stubbles (695), several other in-field options can benefit seed-eating birds. Planting a wild bird seed or cover mixture provides a direct food source and has been shown to increase the abundance and diversity of birds (594). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) increases the abundance of arable weeds, which in turn provides seeds for birds and habitat for insects (652). Undersowing spring cereals with clover can benefit birds like the Eurasian skylark and also increases arthropod abundance (136). Creating cultivated, uncropped plots provides foraging sites and can support rare arable plants, which are a food source for seed-eaters (562). Smaller skylark plots also provide nesting and foraging habitat within dense cereal crops (540).",

    "question": "What are the observed effects of introducing flower-rich habitats, such as nectar mixes or nettle strips, into arable field margins?",
    "answer": "Introducing flower-rich habitats into arable field margins generally has positive effects on invertebrates. Sowing nectar flower or wildflower mixtures has been shown in many studies to increase the abundance, species richness, and diversity of invertebrates, particularly pollinators like bees (442). These strips can also benefit plants, birds, and small mammals (442). A more specific intervention, planting nettle strips, was found in a small study to result in a higher number of aphid predator species, with some insect families like green lacewings found only on nettles (118).",
