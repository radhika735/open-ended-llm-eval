    "answer": "Combining trap and repellent crops in a push-pull system is rated as 'Beneficial', with studies finding more natural predators (753). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies is 'Likely to be beneficial', with three out of four studies finding higher numbers of natural enemies (724). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies has also been shown to increase their numbers in multiple studies (754), as has converting to organic farming (717).",

Similarly, threshold-based insecticide spraying regimes increased natural enemies in some years, but the effects could last for as little as three weeks (750).

    "answer": "The effects are varied. Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops can lead to more natural enemies on the ground, though effects can be short-term or vary between enemy groups (720). Similarly, leaving part of a crop or pasture unharvested was found to increase the abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the uncut area (725). However, both interventions can also lead to an increase in pest numbers in the unmanaged areas (720, 725).",

One study on isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants (773) in cashew trees found it led to lower pest damage and higher yields. In contrast, allowing natural regeneration of ground cover (720) produced more varied results, with two studies finding fewer pests and two studies finding effects that varied between different pest or disease groups.",

You can plant new hedges (752) along field margins; evidence shows this can increase natural enemies in the hedge itself, though one study found no effect on spiders within the crop. Another option is alley cropping (718), where crops are grown between rows of trees, but this has shown mixed effects on natural enemies and two of four studies found it led to more pests. A third option is to create beetle banks (729), which are raised grass strips running through a field.

A related strategy is to also incorporate pest parasitism rates when setting these thresholds (726), which one study found resulted in acceptable crop damage levels. A non-chemical alternative is the 'push-pull' system (753), which uses repellent inter-crops and attractive trap crops. This has been found to reduce pests and increase yields.
