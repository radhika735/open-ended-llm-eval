    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions can increase plant species richness. Sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle has been found to increase plant species richness and/or diversity in five of six studies (3404). Site preparation is also key; one study found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (3415). Additionally, the simple act of sowing native grass and forb seeds was found to increase overall plant species richness in sixteen of twenty-eight studies (3432).",

Three replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or native forb abundance (3397).

For site preparation, removing topsoil (3415) or applying herbicide (3418) before planting or seeding has been shown to increase the cover of target species. For seeding methods, sowing seeds in spring rather than autumn increased the cover of sown species in one UK study (3407), while a Hungarian study found that sowing seeds into large prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of target species (3409).

In arid areas, specific techniques can be useful; hydroseeding (spraying a slurry of seed, mulch, and water) increased overall plant cover in one of two controlled studies in Spain (3412), and irrigating after sowing non-native seeds increased vegetation cover in a majority of cases in another Spanish study (3430). Inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi also initially increased vegetation cover in one US study, though the effect did not last (3429).",

In some studies, plant communities in areas sown with grass seeds (3397) or native grass and forbs (3432) became more similar to intact grasslands over time. However, initial gains in vegetation cover can diminish. For example, a higher grass cover in sown areas was no longer apparent after seven years in one study (3397), and an initial increase in cover from mycorrhizal inoculation disappeared after three years (3429). In contrast, another study found that vegetation cover increased over time after sowing seeds from a local source (3400).",

Sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle can restrict the growth of dominant grasses, potentially allowing other species to increase; five of six studies found this increased overall plant species richness (3404). Another approach is sowing seeds of nurse plants, which are thought to aid other species by creating benign conditions under their canopy (3401, 3402), although evidence for community-level benefits is mixed. In savanna habitats, sowing tree seeds can be used to increase tree abundance within the grassland matrix (3403).",

    "answer": "The evidence on how pre-seeding site preparation affects germination is varied. Removing vegetation using mechanical methods was found in one of two studies to increase germination rates of sown species (3416). Applying herbicide before sowing was found in one study to increase seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (3418). Removing leaf litter had mixed effects in two of three studies, while the third found no change (3414). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of burning vegetation before seeding on grassland vegetation (3417).",

Three of four replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds either reduced native grass cover or did not alter native grass density (3397). Similarly, one of two replicated studies in the USA and Canada found that sowing grass seeds reduced the abundance of native forb species, while the other study found no change in native forb density (3397).",

Increasing the number of species in the seed mix increased the richness of sown plants in two US studies (3406). Sowing seeds of parasitic plants, such as yellow rattle, was found to increase overall plant species richness in five of six studies by suppressing dominant grasses (3404). In contrast, sowing a mix that included nurse species resulted in a plant community less similar to the target community in one study (3402).",

For sowing native grass and forbs, some studies reported an initial increase in species richness that later declined or equalized with unsown areas after 3\u201313 years (3432). When sowing only grass seeds, one study found that an initial increase in grass cover disappeared after seven years (3397). Similarly, a study on inoculating soil with mycorrhiza found an initial increase in vegetation cover that was no longer present after three years (3429). Conversely, one study found sowing seeds in only part of a site led to an increase in plant species richness over time (3408).",
