    "question": "In trawl fisheries, what are the most effective gear modifications for reducing unwanted fish catch?",
    "answer": "Several trawl gear modifications show evidence for reducing unwanted catch. Fitting size-sorting escape grids to both prawn/shrimp (2721) and fish (2720) trawls effectively reduced unwanted fish catch in the majority of studies. Using larger mesh sizes (2697), fitting mesh escape panels (2716), and using square mesh instead of diamond mesh codends (2714) also reduced unwanted catch in a majority of studies, although with some variability depending on the specific fishery and species.",

Protecting spawning fish from capture, for example through seasonal fishery closures, has been shown to offer protection, though evidence for a resulting increase in stock biomass is limited (2938). Setting a minimum landing size is another common measure intended to allow fish to reproduce before being caught, but its effectiveness can be limited, with some studies showing that immature fish may still dominate catches and that positive effects on recruitment are not guaranteed (2735).",

Additionally, establishing move-on rules that trigger temporary closures when catch thresholds are met can reduce fishing effort and mortality (3815).

One study found the majority of some discarded species survived, but survival was reduced by hooking/capture injuries and longer tow durations (2691). Shorter trawl deployments increased survival for some flatfish but not others (2686). Using larger mesh sizes improved survival for skates and rays in one of three studies (2697). Using different hook types reduced injuries associated with mortality in several studies but did not directly improve survival in others (2698). In one study, survival of mackerel was reduced after passing through an escape grid on a purse seine net (2703). Reducing air exposure did not increase survival of small-spotted catshark caught during trawling in one study (2690).",

In the Tasman Sea, one study found that most fish species had lower abundance two years after closure in a marine reserve estuary (2667).

Three studies examined co-management involving fishers and stakeholders: one found it increased overall fish abundance, another reported decreased illegal fishing, while a third found no decrease in fishing effort and a drop in catch rates for some species (2910). We found no studies that evaluated the effects on marine fish populations of including fishers in MPA management groups (2809), involving them in new gear design and trials (2810), or engaging them in scientific data collection (2813).",

Attaching electropositive deterrents to gear reduced unwanted spiny dogfish, skates, and rays in two of four studies (2696). Evidence for other tactics is more limited: one study found artificial lights on shrimp trawls reduced unwanted fish catch (2695), while another found trawling during the day reduced the number, but not weight, of unwanted fish (2684).",

    "question": "Besides closing areas to fishing, what alternative management strategies can reduce overall fishing mortality?",
    "answer": "Alternative strategies to area closures include introducing overall catch limits or quotas, which has been shown to increase the abundance of some commercial stocks and reduce fishing mortality (3811). Implementing catch share systems is another approach, with reviews finding these fisheries have lower rates of over-exploitation (3812). Fishing effort can also be controlled by limiting vessel size and/or engine power; one study found this led to higher abundance of commercially targeted fish (3809). Limiting the number of fishing permits is a further option, although we found no studies evaluating its effect on fish populations (3817).",

Another method is to use a zonation system, creating 'partially-protected zones' where fishing with specified gears or for certain species is permitted, alongside no-take zones (2674). A broader approach is to implement unspecified restrictions on fishing activity to reduce overall pressure (2680). It is also possible to allow only small-scale, traditional (artisanal) fishing, which helps regulate fishing pressure while supporting local communities (2678).",

Using a larger mesh size appears consistently effective, with nineteen of twenty-one studies finding it improved size-selectivity for assessed fish species (2697). Decreasing the circumference of the codend also showed positive results for species like haddock and whiting in four of eight studies (2706). Using square mesh codends instead of diamond mesh, or rotating the diamond mesh orientation (T90), has been found to improve selectivity for round-bodied fish in several studies, though the effect is less clear for flatfish (2714, 2715). Fitting square mesh escape panels has also improved selectivity for cod and haddock in some studies (2716).",

Modifying longlines, such as by using nylon hook attachments, was found in two of four studies to reduce unwanted catches of sharks and/or rays (2699). Using different hook types, including different sizes or styles, reduced unwanted catch in eight of 16 studies, but four global reviews found hook style did not affect unwanted catch of billfish or sharks (2698).

    "question": "What is the evidence for gear modifications improving the size-selectivity of commercial fishing gear?",
    "answer": "There is considerable evidence that using a larger mesh size improves size-selectivity for many fish species across various gear types [2697]. Using a square mesh codend in a trawl net instead of a diamond mesh one has also been found to improve size-selectivity, particularly for round-bodied fish [2714], as has rotating the orientation of a diamond mesh (T90) [2715]. For line fishing, studies have found that increasing hook size can improve size-selectivity for certain species [2698]. In contrast, some operational changes, such as changing trawl towing speed [2687] or using artificial lights on a size-sorting grid [2695], were found in some studies not to improve size-selectivity.",

    "question": "What are the documented ecological outcomes of managing small-scale traditional fisheries, either through prohibition or by making them the only permitted fishing type?",
    "answer": "Evidence on managing small-scale fisheries shows varied outcomes depending on the approach. A study on prohibiting customary fishing in the Bismark Sea found it increased the abundance of only one of seven fish species and was associated with a behavioural change where fish became less wary, potentially increasing their vulnerability to spearfishing [2675]. Conversely, a study in the Adriatic Sea where only artisanal fishing was permitted within a marine protected area zone found higher commercial catch rates for five of seven species compared to openly fished unprotected areas, suggesting a potential benefit of excluding other fishing pressures [2678].",
