    "question": "What are some effective non-chemical alternatives for managing invasive water primrose in European wetlands?",
    "answer": "Effective non-chemical alternatives to herbicides (1139) include biological control and combination treatments. A controlled field study found that a flea beetle caused heavy destruction to water primrose seedlings and significantly reduced its abundance (1135). Additionally, combining physical removal with herbicide application was found to be effective, achieving a 75% kill rate in one study and an 85-90% reduction in another (1140). In contrast, physical removal by itself, such as hand pulling and raking, failed to reduce water primrose abundance in one study and is rated 'Unlikely to be beneficial' (1138).",

For Asian clams, a laboratory study found that exposure to high salinities of 18-34 parts per thousand resulted in 100% mortality, making this action 'Beneficial' (1115). Similarly, another lab study found that water temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams, and this action is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (1116). For invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarids (shrimp), a study found that increasing salinity killed the majority of shrimp within five hours (1091), and another found that heating water to over 43\u00b0C killed all shrimp immediately (1092); both actions are considered 'Likely to be beneficial'.",

A study in Belgium found that using double fyke nets significantly reduced the population of brown bullhead measuring over 8cm (1051).

Seven studies found glyphosate reduced C. helmsii, and diquat was also found to be effective on submerged plants (1279).

Conversely, methods rated as unlikely to be beneficial include hydrogen peroxide, which did not control the plant in tank trials (1281), hot foam, which had no effect in one controlled study (1286), and aquatic dyes, which also did not reduce coverage (1293).",

For water primrose, triclopyr TEA was found to be effective in a lab study (1139). The use of adjuvants, or sticking agents, is also critical.

For smaller invertebrates like Ponto-Caspian gammarids, biosecurity measures for equipment are key. Studies have shown that submerging equipment in hot water (>43\u00b0C) kills the shrimp immediately (1092). Chemical dips using substances like iodine solution or acetic acid were also found to kill invasive killer shrimp in lab tests, although they were considered impractical for field application (1095).

    "question": "For controlling invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in European ponds, what are some effective non-chemical management strategies?",
    "answer": "Studies suggest that trapping and removal, especially when baited with food, can be beneficial for controlling red swamp crayfish (1029). Sterilizing males by exposing them to X-rays has been found to reduce offspring production (1032). Encouraging native predators like eels and pike can also help reduce crayfish population size (1030). A combination of trapping and encouraging predators has been shown to be more effective than predation alone and can significantly reduce crayfish populations (1031).",

    "question": "What is the state of the evidence for using physical barriers to control the movement of various invasive species, from crayfish to aquatic plants?",
    "answer": "The evidence shows that physical barriers can be effective for a range of species. For red swamp crayfish, specially designed concrete dams successfully contained their upstream spread (1037). An electrical barrier was found to prevent the movement of Ponto-Caspian gobies (1074). For Asian clams, placing gas-impermeable barriers on a lake bottom significantly reduced their abundance (1117). In the case of the invasive plant Crassula helmsii, covering it with lightproof barriers like black sheeting or carpet strips successfully eradicated or severely reduced its cover in several UK studies (1294).",

    "question": "What direct removal techniques are available for controlling invasive American bullfrogs and red-eared terrapins in North American ponds?",
    "answer": "Various direct removal methods have been studied with mixed success. For American bullfrogs, removing juveniles with double fyke nets was effective, and shooting metamorphosed individuals before they could reproduce significantly reduced populations as part of a combination treatment (1046). However, catching adult bullfrogs with the same nets had low success, and populations rebounded quickly after intensive adult removal (1045). For red-eared terrapins, specialized turtle traps and seine nets were used to capture adults and juveniles, but these methods did not achieve eradication (1055).",

    "question": "What are the documented outcomes of various physical and novel chemical control methods for floating pennywort?",
    "answer": "Several methods have been tested with varying success. Physical removal using a mechanical digger combined with monthly hand-picking was found to greatly reduce the plant's cover, although it did not lead to complete eradication (1126). Flame treatments were shown to be potentially fatal to the plant; a pilot experiment found that a 3-second application, repeated after 11 days, killed the pennywort (1131). In contrast, using hydrogen peroxide appears to be an ineffective control method, as even the highest tested concentrations were not sufficient to kill the plant (1129).",
