    "answer": "Both actions are found to be beneficial for soil fertility. Adding compost is rated as 'Beneficial', with twelve studies finding more organic matter and six studies finding more microbial biomass [1362]. Adding manure is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with five out of eight studies finding more organic matter, but two studies finding similar amounts of microbial biomass in soils with or without manure [1363].",

For crop production, it is rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with seven studies finding lower crop yields compared to conventional tillage [1355]. For pest regulation, it is also rated 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', as three studies found more weeds in no-tillage plots and one found a higher incidence of a crop disease [1397].",

    "answer": "Comparing no tillage to reduced tillage shows mixed results for soil health. No-tillage systems can have more soil organic matter and phosphorus, but nitrogen levels can be inconsistent, sometimes higher and sometimes lower than reduced tillage (1370). Microbial biomass is often similar between the two systems, although one study found fewer denitrifying bacteria under no tillage. Soil aggregation and stability results are also inconsistent, with some studies showing improvement under no tillage and others showing no difference or even lower stability (1370). Overall, using no tillage instead of reduced tillage is rated as 'unlikely to be beneficial' for soil fertility (1370).",

Adding compost, manure, sewage sludge, or slurry was found in multiple studies to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and/or nitrous oxide (1362, 1363, 1364, 1365). In contrast, while using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic fertilizer could lead to higher carbon dioxide emissions, it was also associated with lower nitrous oxide emissions and increased methane absorption by the soil in some studies (1366).",
