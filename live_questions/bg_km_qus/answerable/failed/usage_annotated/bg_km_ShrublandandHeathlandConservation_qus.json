    "answer": "Several techniques have been studied, with mixed results. Using herbicides has been found to reduce grass cover in some studies, but not others (1643). Cutting or mowing can reduce grass cover, but this may be temporary, and the practice has shown no effect on shrub or forb cover in several studies (1638). Other methods with unknown effectiveness include altering livestock grazing (1646), stripping turf which increased heathland plants (1647), and using prescribed fire, which one study found did not reduce the target grass but did reduce heather (1723).",

Another alternative is to increase the number of livestock.

    "question": "In US shrublands, what non-herbicide management options exist for controlling grass, and what are their impacts?",
    "answer": "Several non-herbicide options have been studied in the USA. Cutting to control grass did not alter shrub seedling abundance or native forb cover in multiple studies (1638). A paired study found that raking reduced the cover of both invasive and native grasses, as well as forbs (1640). Adding mulch did not reduce grass cover or affect the number of shrub seedlings (1649). However, combining cutting with sowing shrub seeds was found in one study to increase shrub seedling abundance while reducing grass cover (1639).",

For instance, when used to control trees in Italy, prescribed burning reduced the cover of common heather [1721]. Similarly, a UK study found that burning to control purple moor grass also led to a reduction in common heather cover [1723]. This negative impact on heather was also observed when burning was combined with cutting or herbicide application to control grass [1724, 1725].",

    "answer": "Evidence exists for several alternatives to prescribed burning, though effectiveness is often rated as 'Unknown'. Cutting or mowing to mimic grazing has been studied as a way to limit woody species, but with mixed results on heather cover in studies from Spain and Italy (1627). Increasing livestock numbers can also manage succession, but studies show mixed effects on shrub and heather cover, with some reporting declines under high density grazing (1628). The effectiveness of these interventions often depends on the specific context of the shrubland.",

Reducing or stopping grazing generally increases the abundance or cover of shrubs and increases vegetation height, although some studies found no change (1607). Conversely, increasing livestock numbers often leads to a decline in shrub and heather cover, though it can increase the number of plant species and grass cover (1628). The effects on overall plant species richness are mixed for both interventions, with studies reporting increases, decreases, or no change depending on the context (1607, 1628).",
