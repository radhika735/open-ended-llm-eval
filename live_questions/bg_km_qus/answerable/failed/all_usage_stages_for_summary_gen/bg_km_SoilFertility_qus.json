    "question": "What are some of the most effective actions for reducing soil erosion on agricultural land?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been shown to reduce soil erosion. Five studies found that adding mulch reduced soil erosion and runoff (887). While nine studies on tillage practices showed mixed results, seven of them found that reduced tillage decreased soil loss and runoff (906). Growing cover crops beneath the main crop (897) and planting new hedges (744) have also been found to reduce erosion in multiple studies. Finally, five trials found that controlled traffic farming reduced runoff (899).",

    "question": "On agricultural land, what are the documented benefits and drawbacks of amending soil with manures or municipal wastes?",
    "answer": "Amending soil with these materials can have both positive and negative effects. For manures, studies found benefits including higher microbial biomass, higher crop yields, increased soil organic carbon, and reduced nutrient loss (911). However, one study also found that manure application could lead to higher nitrate leaching (911). For municipal wastes, one trial found the benefit of reduced soil loss and water runoff, but another study found mixed results from adding composts and wastes, implying potential drawbacks (890).",

    "question": "What actions are available to improve the physical structure of clay and clay-loam soils?",
    "answer": "Several actions can improve the structure of heavy soils. Using crop rotation can lead to lower soil penetration resistance (857). Growing cover crops when the field is empty was found to improve soil structure and increase porosity (898). Adding organic processing wastes such as cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure in one trial (891). In another trial, adding manure and compost led to larger soil aggregations and improved physical properties (911). However, growers should be aware that one study found that reduced tillage on clay soils could lead to higher compaction (906).",
