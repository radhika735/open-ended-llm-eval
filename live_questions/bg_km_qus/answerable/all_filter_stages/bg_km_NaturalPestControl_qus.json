For delaying mowing, two replicated, randomised and controlled studies from the UK found no change in insect predator numbers (727). For using grazing instead of cutting, one before-and-after study from the UK found mixed effects on natural enemies, with impacts varying by species and date (885).",

Three of four studies on planting attractive non-crop plants (724) found higher numbers of natural enemies, and all four studies found a decrease in pest population or damage. In contrast, for using manufactured attractive chemicals (754), the evidence was more mixed; only five of 13 studies found more natural enemies, while eight found varied effects.

One is to use pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach pre-defined threshold levels (750); multiple studies found this approach required fewer pesticide applications and resulted in similar profit compared to conventional spraying. A related strategy is to also incorporate pest parasitism rates when setting these thresholds (726), which one study found resulted in acceptable crop damage levels. A non-chemical alternative is the 'push-pull' system (753), which uses repellent inter-crops and attractive trap crops. This has been found to reduce pests and increase yields.

For other actions, profitability depends on external factors; organic farming (717) increased profit only when produce received a premium price, and beetle banks (729) provided economic savings only if they prevented a pest outbreak. Some methods were found to decrease profit, including alley cropping (718).
