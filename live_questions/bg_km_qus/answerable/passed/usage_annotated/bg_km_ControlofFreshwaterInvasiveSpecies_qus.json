    "answer": "Applying herbicides like glyphosate and diquat has been found to reduce or eradicate Crassula helmsii [1279]. Similarly, physical methods have shown success; covering the plant with black sheeting or carpet strips can eradicate or severely reduce its cover, and using seawater has also been shown to eradicate it in several trials [1294, 1288]. However, one study noted that after initial eradication with black sheeting, Crassula helmsii progressively recolonized the site [1294].",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests several beneficial actions. Introducing native predators like the northern pike can lead to a strong decline in bullfrog tadpole numbers [1039]. Direct removal of juveniles using methods like double fyke nets in small, shallow ponds can be effective, especially as part of a combined treatment [1046]. Direct removal of adults through methods like shooting can also significantly reduce their numbers, although populations may rebound rapidly following intensive removal [1045]. Finally, certain chemicals like caffeine or chloroxylenol have been found to kill American bullfrogs in controlled studies [1048].",

    "answer": "The outcomes of using herbivores for biological control are mixed. For floating pennywort, a South American weevil caused feeding lesions but did not reduce the plant's biomass in field trials, making it unlikely to be beneficial [1123]. In contrast, for water primrose, a flea beetle was found to cause heavy feeding destruction and significantly reduce its abundance, suggesting this approach is likely to be beneficial [1135]. For parrot's feather, the introduction of grass carp reduced its abundance in some studies, but not in others, while a leaf-feeding beetle reduced its growth, indicating a trade-off between benefits and harms [1599].",

Encouraging predators like eels may reduce population size, though this action is rated as unlikely to be beneficial on its own [1030]. A combination of trapping and encouraging predators has been shown to be more effective than predation alone and can significantly reduce crayfish populations [1031].

Mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes can permanently remove or reduce clam numbers, as can the addition of a sand filter [1119]. Altering water conditions is another option: exposing clams to high temperatures (36\u00b0C or higher), which may be feasible in industrial facilities, leads to high mortality [1116]. Other methods shown to be effective in wider settings include mechanical suction dredging, which can reduce clam densities by 96% [1120], and placing gas-impermeable barriers on the bed of a waterbody [1117].",

    "question": "What factors influence the success of physical removal for invasive plants like skunk cabbage and water primrose, which can regenerate from fragments?",
    "answer": "The success of physical removal often depends on the scale of the infestation and the thoroughness of the removal process. For skunk cabbage, annual removal of recently established plants over five years was successful, but a twice-yearly program on a large infestation was less effective [1101]. For water primrose, hand-pulling failed to reduce a large population but did eradicate a smaller one at the margins of a pond [1138]. Similarly, for floating pennywort, removal was ineffective in one study because the growth rate exceeded the rate of removal, while another study greatly reduced its cover with mechanical removal followed by monthly hand-picking, but did not achieve eradication [1126]. The key factor is the ability to remove all fragments, as incomplete removal can lead to regeneration and continued spread.",

    "answer": "Physical removal has shown varied success. For skunk cabbage, annual removal of recently established plants over five years successfully removed the entire stock in one study, though another study on a large population still required significant removal after four years (1101). In contrast, for floating pennywort, one study found the growth rate exceeded the rate of removal, while another study reported that mechanical removal followed by monthly hand-picking greatly reduced its cover but failed to achieve complete eradication (1126).",

For Procambarus crayfish, no studies were found that directly tested this method, although a review noted it can have a significant short-term impact but does not lead to eradication and causes major habitat damage (1034). Similarly, no evidence was captured for using this as a management tool for Asian clams, though ecological studies suggest that low water levels can cause 100% mortality due to desiccation (1110). There is also no evidence for its effect on red-eared terrapins or bullheads (1057, 1078).",

For red swamp crayfish, baiting traps with food (tinned meat) was found to be most effective, capturing over half of all crayfish in one study (1029). However, trapping alone was found to be ineffective for managing spiny-cheeked crayfish (1029).

For red swamp crayfish, combining trapping with the introduction of predators significantly reduced populations in a pond and was more effective than predation alone (1031).

Chemical control is another option; a study found that chemicals such as caffeine and chloroxylenol were lethal to bullfrogs, but the overall effectiveness of this method in the wild is currently unknown (1048).",

    "question": "Besides direct chemical application, what alternative methods have proven beneficial for managing invasive fish like brown/black bullheads and Ponto-Caspian gobies?",
    "answer": "For brown and black bullheads, netting with double fyke nets was found to significantly reduce the population of fish larger than 8cm in a replicated study, offering a viable alternative to chemical controls (1051). For Ponto-Caspian gobies, where there is no evidence for biocide use (1063), two beneficial alternatives have been identified. A laboratory study found that increasing water salinity to 30\u2030 resulted in 100% mortality (1072), and a field study demonstrated that an electrical barrier effectively prevented their movement (1074).",

    "answer": "The outcomes of physical removal for these plants are highly variable and context-dependent. For skunk cabbage, annual removal over five years successfully eliminated a stock of recently established plants, but a twice-yearly program on a larger population still required significant removal efforts after four years (1101). For floating pennywort, one study found its growth rate outpaced removal efforts, whereas another achieved a significant reduction but not full eradication (1126). Similarly for water primrose, hand pulling and raking failed to reduce its abundance in one instance, yet the same method successfully eradicated a smaller population from the margins of a pond in another case (1138).",

    "question": "When attempting direct removal of American bullfrogs, is it more effective to target adults or juveniles?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests targeting juveniles may be more effective. A study in Belgium found that double fyke nets were effective at catching tadpoles (juveniles), but had very low catchability for adults (1046, 1045). While one study found that shooting adult bullfrogs before reproduction could significantly reduce their numbers as part of a combination treatment, another study in the USA found that populations rebounded quickly after intensive adult removal (1045). In contrast, removing juveniles by trapping (as part of a combination treatment) led to a significant reduction in both adult and juvenile numbers in a French study (1046).",

In contrast, while a weevil showed a preference for floating pennywort in lab tests, it failed to reduce the plant's biomass in the field, suggesting lab success does not always translate to field effectiveness (1123). The type of herbivore also matters; while host-specific insects are often sought, generalist herbivores like grass carp have been used, such as in a US study where they reduced parrot's feather abundance, but these pose a risk to non-target native plants (1599).",
