Delaying herbicide use (774) and altering the timing of insecticide use (723) have both been shown to increase natural enemy numbers in some studies. Switching to a threshold-based spraying regime can also increase natural enemies, though effects may be temporary. This approach consistently leads to fewer pesticide applications and can lower production costs without necessarily reducing profit (750).",
