    "question": "When trying to control bracken in UK heathlands, how does using herbicide alone compare to cutting, or a combination of both?",
    "answer": "The evidence for these methods is mixed, and all are rated as having 'unknown effectiveness'. Applying herbicide alone increased heather seedlings in one trial but had no effect on heather cover in two other studies (1652). Cutting bracken also yielded mixed results, with two studies finding it increased heather cover or biomass, while two other studies found no effect (1653). A combination of cutting and applying herbicide increased heather cover in one trial but did not alter heather biomass in another (1654). In terms of reducing bracken itself, all three methods showed a reduction in bracken biomass or cover in at least some studies (1652, 1653, 1654).",

    "question": "How do the effects of reducing or stopping livestock grazing on shrub cover vary across different countries?",
    "answer": "The effects vary geographically. Studies in the UK and South Africa found that reducing or stopping grazing increased the abundance or cover of shrubs (1607). In contrast, studies in the USA found that stopping grazing did not increase shrub abundance (1607). A study in France found that ungrazed sites had higher cover of ericaceous shrubs but lower cover of non-ericaceous shrubs than grazed sites, while another UK study found mixed effects (1607).",

    "question": "What are the most beneficial interventions for encouraging shrubland recovery after a fire?",
    "answer": "Allowing shrubland to regenerate without active management after a fire is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' (1679). Five before-and-after trials in the USA, UK, and Norway found this approach increased shrub cover or biomass. Other restoration actions rated as 'Likely to be beneficial' in general contexts, such as sowing seeds (1698) and adding topsoil from other shrublands (1686), could also be considered to aid recovery.",

    "question": "What are the comparative effects of different methods for controlling problematic trees in shrublands, such as cutting, burning, grazing, and herbicide use?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests varied outcomes. Applying herbicide alone increased plant diversity and heather seedlings but not shrub cover (1629). Cutting trees increased heather seedling density and herbaceous cover but not mature shrub cover (1630). Combining cutting with seedling removal was found to increase plant diversity and shrub cover (1632). Similarly, combining cutting with herbicide increased plant diversity and seedling abundance, but results for shrub cover were mixed (1636). Using grazing (1634) or prescribed burning (1721, 1722), either alone or together, tended to reduce the cover of common heather while also reducing tree cover.",

    "question": "What techniques involving the addition of materials to soil have been studied for restoring degraded shrublands, and what were their outcomes?",
    "answer": "Several techniques involving adding materials to soil have been evaluated. Adding topsoil from other shrublands is considered 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing it increased the cover and abundance of heathland and woody plants (1686). Adding manure was found in one study to increase plant cover and the number of species (1695). In contrast, adding sulphur to make soil more acidic did not increase the number of heather seedlings in one study (1691). The effectiveness of adding manure or sulphur remains unknown.",

Multiple studies found that sowing seeds increased shrub cover, and adding topsoil increased the cover and abundance of heathland plants. Other techniques like planting turf (1703) or stripping topsoil before adding seeds/clippings (1711) have also shown positive results in studies by increasing heathland plant cover, but their overall effectiveness is rated as unknown.",
