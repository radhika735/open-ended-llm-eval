    "answer": "Evidence for a direct comparison is limited and neither action consistently showed strong positive effects across all species. Studies on long-term closures found mixed results, with some showing a higher abundance for only one of seven species monitored and others showing increases only for young salmon (2655). For temporary closures, one study found no increase in the biomass of spawning cod compared to fished areas (2664).",

A majority of studies found higher fish species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to fished areas (2682). In contrast, MPAs where limited fishing exceptions are permitted showed less benefit, with studies finding lower species richness and similar or lower fish biomass and density compared to unprotected areas (2681).

    "question": "How do the effects on fish community composition of prohibiting all commercial fishing compare between the Tasman Sea and the South Atlantic Ocean?",
    "answer": "The effects on fish community composition from prohibiting all commercial fishing vary by location. In the Tasman Sea, one study found that the fish assemblage was different two years after prohibiting all commercial fishing in an estuary (2667). In contrast, a study in the South Atlantic Ocean found no change in species composition between a reserve closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years and unprotected fished areas (2667).",

    "question": "What does the evidence suggest about the timeframe over which prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area leads to increased fish abundance?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that increased fish abundance can be seen over various timeframes, though not all studies show a positive effect. Thirty out of 54 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more had higher fish abundances compared to fished areas (2682). Conversely, eight studies found similar fish abundances between one and 20 years after implementation. The effect can also vary by species group, with one study showing that in a non-fished zone protected for at least 10 years, abundance was higher for some fish groups but lower for others compared to a no-entry zone (2682).",

    "question": "What is the evidence from global reviews on the effectiveness of catch share systems for managing fish stocks sustainably?",
    "answer": "Two worldwide systematic reviews assessed catch share systems. One found that fisheries managed under catch shares were more likely to meet biomass sustainability targets and had lower rates of over-exploitation compared to non-catch share fisheries (3812). However, another review found no difference in performance on biomass targets between fisheries under catch shares, fleet-wide catch caps, or effort controls, though it did find that fewer catch share stocks were over-exploited than those with just effort controls (3811, 3812).",

    "question": "What are the comparative effects of long-term versus temporary fishery closures on marine fish populations?",
    "answer": "Evidence for long-term fishery closures suggests they can have positive but mixed effects; some studies found higher abundance for certain species and better condition in young salmon, while others found no overall increase in biomass or abundance for other species [2655]. For temporary fishery closures, one study on cod found no increase in biomass, survival, or length, whereas another study noted that closures can offer protection during sensitive periods like spawning [2664]. In some cases, temporary closures were followed by increased catch rates for certain species [2664].",

    "answer": "The effects of deterrents on fishing gear are mixed. One study found that using artificial lights on a shrimp trawl reduced the catch of unwanted fish [2695]. However, another study found that lights did not improve the size-selectivity of a sorting grid [2695]. For electropositive deterrents, some studies found they reduced the unwanted catch of sharks, rays, and undersized halibut, while other studies and a global review found no effect on unwanted catches of sharks and rays [2696]. These materials have also been shown to alter the feeding behaviour of some shark species, reducing bait consumption in some cases [2696].",

    "question": "What are the most effective spatial management actions for protecting spawning fish and their habitats?",
    "answer": "The most direct evidence for effectiveness comes from prohibiting all types of fishing within a marine protected area, which one study found resulted in more eggs of commercially targeted fish species compared to fished areas [2682]. Seasonal fishery closures specifically targeting spawning aggregations can provide protection to adult fish, with one study showing tagged cod spent considerable time inside such a closed area during the spawning period [2938, 2664]. However, evidence that this translates to an increase in the spawning population is not consistent [2938, 2664]. Broader measures like prohibiting all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom species may also help by preserving essential fish habitats which can include spawning grounds [2654].",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas on fish communities differ between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean?",
    "answer": "In both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, studies show that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas can lead to different fish community compositions, as well as higher species richness and abundance compared to fished areas [2682]. Specific studies have highlighted different ecological effects; for instance, a Mediterranean study noted more fish eggs inside a reserve, while an Indian Ocean study found higher fish grazing rates, indicating positive outcomes in both regions [2682]. However, the evidence also shows some variability, as one study in the Indian Ocean found that the measured effect on species richness could differ depending on the sampling method used [2682].",
