    "question": "What methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods to control disease and parasites have been studied. Fallowing farm sites was associated with lower sea lice numbers in a Scottish study (1026). Biological controls, such as using cleaner wrasse, were found to be as effective as chemical treatments for lice in one study, though another found them ineffective (738). Altering environmental conditions, such as using low-intensity lighting, also resulted in lower numbers of lice in a Norwegian study (741). Additionally, dietary changes, such as feeding salmon a probiotic, increased survival when exposed to disease-causing bacteria (732).",

Vaccinations resulted in higher survival in salmon exposed to various bacteria in studies across Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada (733). Selectively breeding salmon for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis led to increased survival levels compared to a low-resistance family in a Norwegian study (735). In another study, salmon that underwent aerobic training also showed higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Furthermore, feeding salmon a probiotic before exposure to four different bacteria also increased survival (732).",

Integrated aquaculture systems, where species like blue mussels or algae are grown near farms, can absorb waste and show enhanced growth (932). Constructing artificial reefs can attract species that have the potential to remove organic compounds from farm effluents (934). In freshwater systems, sludge drying beds have been found to remove phosphorus from fish farm sludge (943).",

    "question": "What is the evidence from Australian studies on the effectiveness of different husbandry practices for managing Amoebic Gill Disease in farmed salmon?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Australian studies on managing Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD) is mixed. One study found no difference in salmon mortality from AGD where a fallowing system had been used (1026). Evidence for freshwater bathing is also mixed, with one study finding a reduction in amoebae on gills for up to 10 days, while another found similar levels of amoebae in treated and untreated salmon (739). In contrast, a replicated study recorded lower levels of AGD in salmon kept within larger cages compared to smaller ones (742).",

For salmon fed krill meal, the hindgut bacterial flora composition was different and the number of aerobic bacteria was higher compared to fish meal diets (916). For salmon fed diets with plant-based proteins, two studies found that the morphology of the distal intestine was altered, and two other studies noted a reduction in the condition of the salmon (924).",

    "answer": "Several non-chemical methods are available. For controlling sea lice, using cleaner wrasse as a biological control has shown mixed results, with some wrasse species being as effective as chemical treatments (738). Altering the farm environment by using low-intensity or natural lighting has also been reported to reduce lice numbers on salmon (741). To manage biofouling on nets, silicon coatings can be used to accumulate fewer organisms, and treating nets with water at 50\u00b0C has been found to prevent the settlement of hydroids (937).",

    "answer": "The success of non-pesticide sea lice control appears to depend on specific factors related to the method used. For biological controls, the species of cleaner wrasse is a key factor; one study found corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were effective, whereas rockcook cleaner wrasse were not (738). For environmental controls, light intensity is important, as a study reported that lower-intensity artificial light or natural lighting led to fewer lice than more intense artificial light (741).",

Conversely, multiple studies in Norway found that including plant-based proteins led to decreased growth rates and reduced final body weights compared to fish meal diets (924).",

Plant-based diets were also found to lower feeding efficiency and digestibility in some studies. Additionally, two studies noted that while survival and appetite were unaffected, the morphology of the distal intestine was altered (924). On a positive note, adding beta-glucans to a plant-based protein diet was found to reduce lice infection (732).",

Another study found higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis if they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective (740).
