    "answer": "There is limited but emerging evidence for treating bats directly, but no evidence for the effectiveness of most other preventative strategies. Two studies found that treating infected little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in lab or field settings, although results on disease severity were mixed (2008). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), restricting human access to caves to reduce spread (1010), decontaminating equipment (2006), treating hibernacula environments (2007), or using captive breeding to supplement affected populations (2009).",

Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road at traffic height (976). Overpasses are also used, but again, studies found many bats crossed elsewhere or below traffic height (977). One study found a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979). In contrast, bat gantries were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with most bats crossing below them at a dangerous height (978). Additionally, maintaining existing roosts within road bridges (1966) or creating new roosting spaces (1967) can support bat populations affected by such infrastructure.",

    "question": "How do different methods for restricting public access to bat hibernation sites, such as gates versus fences, compare in their effects on bat populations?",
    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms for restricting access. Installing gates at cave (999) or mine (1963) entrances can lead to fewer bats, fewer species, and altered flight behaviour. However, some studies found bat populations increased or stabilized after gates were installed (999). Regarding fences, one study in Spain found no difference in population growth or occupancy rates for bats in caves with or without fencing or gates (1991). In contrast, a study in the USA found that significantly more bats emerged from a cave after a gate was replaced with a fence, suggesting fences may be less disruptive in some contexts (1991).",

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') was found to be 'beneficial', with ten of twelve studies showing it resulted in fewer bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') is also 'beneficial', with five of six studies finding it reduced fatalities (970). Slowing the rotation of blades at low wind speeds was also found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in one study (2939). Finally, automatically reducing turbine rotation when bat activity is high is 'likely to be beneficial', with two studies showing it led to fewer bat deaths (971).",

To prevent fruit bats from damaging orchards, non-lethal measures such as organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags, and netting tree branches were found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in reducing fruit damage (1953). For managing rabies risk from vampire bats, alternatives like vaccinating livestock or humans have been suggested, but no studies were found that evaluated the effects of replacing culling with these methods on vampire bat populations (1950, 1979). Broader strategies include public education campaigns to dispel myths and improve perceptions of bats, which studies have found can result in more positive attitudes (1000).",

    "answer": "Evidence exists for two actions to provide roosting sites in trees. One study in Australia found that artificial hollows cut into trees were used by roosting long-eared bats (2047). A UK-based study found that when a felled tree trunk containing a common noctule bat maternity roost was reattached to a nearby tree, the colony continued to use it (2048).",

In contrast, legally protecting bats during development is rated 'Unknown effectiveness'.

A potential benefit is increased protection from human disturbance, with several studies finding that bat populations increased or stabilized in caves after gates were installed (999). However, negative impacts are also documented. Both cave and mine gating can lead to roost abandonment, reduced bat populations, and fewer species (999, 1963). Gates can alter bat behaviour, causing them to circle more and enter less, and sometimes collide with the gate (999, 1963). One study also found that bats hibernating in a gated cave lost more body mass than those in an unmodified cave (999).",

Retaining existing roosts and their access points is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing continued use by bats, sometimes in similar or greater numbers post-development (947). Changing the timing of building work to avoid the maternity season also led to a roost being used by similar numbers of bats in one study (950). Creating new alternative roosts has 'Unknown effectiveness'; studies show variable use, and newly built roosts were found to be four times less likely to be used by returning bats than retained roosts (949). Relocating access points also has 'Unknown effectiveness', with studies finding it led to reduced roost use or that success was dependent on the specific design of the new access point (946).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests that success is influenced by roost design, position, and microclimate. For bat boxes, higher occupancy has been associated with specific designs (e.g., rocket boxes, concrete boxes), larger sizes, and black colouring (1024). Positional factors linked to success include orientation relative to sunlight, height, and location (e.g., on buildings vs. trees), with higher occupancy rates in areas with known pre-existing roosts and where more boxes are installed (1024). Managing the microclimate can also be crucial; modifying artificial roosts to reduce internal temperatures increased the number of bats using them (2052). In contrast, heated bat boxes were found to be largely unsuccessful (2052). Additionally, in development contexts, newly created roosts are less likely to be used than retained ones (949).",
