    "answer": "Several strategies are effective for reducing stereotypic behaviours. Providing bones was found to decrease these behaviours in lions and tigers (1902). Presenting food frozen in ice also decreased abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in bears and felids (1923). Similarly, hiding food reduced stereotypic pacing in leopard cats and black bears (1915), and presenting food inside objects decreased stereotypic behaviours in sloth and spectacled bears (1924).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects of modifying captive primate diets to better reflect what they would eat in the wild?",
    "answer": "Modifying primate diets to be more natural has shown several positive effects. Formulating a diet to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, such as by removing fruit, was found to lower aggression in lemurs and reduce regurgitation in gorillas (1329). Providing cut branches (browse) encouraged wild-type foraging skills in gorillas (1332). Replacing pellet feed with fresh produce increased time spent feeding and decreased inactivity in rhesus macaques (1335).",

    "answer": "Hiding and scattering food appear effective for increasing foraging and activity. Hiding food increased exploring and foraging in multiple species including leopard cats and maned wolves, and decreased pacing in leopard cats (1915). Scattering food increased locomotion in maned wolves (1921). Simply altering the location of food was also found to be effective, decreasing pacing in cheetahs (1918). All three methods show some positive behavioural outcomes.",

However, other interventions that can encourage tool use have been studied. Presenting food in water-filled troughs was found to increase tool use and activity in monkeys (1320). The use of puzzle feeders also increased the use of tools and foraging behaviour, but had the negative trade-off of increasing aggression (1318).",

Two studies found that simulating a wet and dry season stimulated breeding and egg deposition, though one of these studies reported that no resulting toadlets survived past 142 days (1872).
