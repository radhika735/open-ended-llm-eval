    "question": "What conservation actions have evidence from Canada for improving soil health, particularly biodiversity and organic matter?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Canada shows that including forage crops and legumes in crop rotations can reduce soil loss and increase the number of microbes (857). Adding mulch was found to increase soil animal and fungal numbers (887). While one study on organic farming found lower nutrient levels (895), multiple studies on reduced tillage found more microbes and higher soil organic carbon and matter (906).",

    "answer": "Two controlled, replicated trials found that adding municipal compost could reduce soil loss and water runoff, although one study found mixed results (890). Similarly, adding organic processing wastes like cotton gin compost and poultry manure was found in one trial to improve soil structure and reduce soil loss, but it also increased nutrient loss. Another trial found that adding molasses, an organic processing waste, improved nutrient retention (891).",

    "answer": "Reducing physical disturbance can have several effects. Reduced tillage was found in multiple studies to increase soil microbes and their activity, reduce soil loss and runoff, and increase soil organic carbon (906). However, it could also increase soil compaction in some cases (906). Controlling farm traffic has been shown to reduce compaction, decrease runoff, and increase water infiltration (899). It was also found to increase the numbers and activity of soil bacteria (899).",

Two replicated trials on converting to organic farming found that fruit was of a higher quality, but that organic management had mixed effects on yield overall (895). In contrast, two replicated trials found that controlled traffic increased crop yields (899). One replicated trial found that a ryegrass cover crop led to higher tomato yields (898), and a study found higher yields when subsoiling was performed as part of tillage practices (906).",

Converting to organic farming was also found to result in higher numbers and diversity of soil organisms in four studies (895). Additionally, amending the soil with a mix of organic and inorganic fertilizers was found to increase microbial biomass and activity in five trials, with one also finding increased microbial diversity (902).
