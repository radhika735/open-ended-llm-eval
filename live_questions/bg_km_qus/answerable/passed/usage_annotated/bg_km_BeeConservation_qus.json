    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that sowing uncropped field margins is more effective than leaving them to naturally regenerate. Sowing margins with a native wild flower seed mix was shown in five UK trials to support a higher abundance and often species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped or grassy margins (19). Similarly, four trials showed that margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (e.g., perennial legumes) attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). In contrast, evidence for uncropped grassy margins is mixed (14), and the value of naturally regenerated margins can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species (20).",

    "answer": "Sowing margins with an agricultural nectar and pollen mix, often containing perennial legumes, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated margins (18). However, the value of these sown margins can degrade and may require re-sowing every few years (18). Sowing with native wild flowers has also been shown to support a higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important for long-tongued species (19). In contrast, while naturally regenerated margins can support more bumblebees than cropped areas, their value for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may depend on the presence of weed species like thistles (20).",

Practising lower-intensity gardening, with less tidiness and pesticide use, was also found to support more bumblebee species in one UK study (2). Along infrastructure corridors, restoring road verges with native prairie vegetation supported more bees and a greater diversity of species than frequently mown grass verges in one US trial (30).

Challenges in captivity include the importance of pollen diet, as fresh pollen led to better queen survival and larger colonies than dried pollen (50). When reintroduced to the wild, the success of laboratory-reared colonies is variable. Of four trials that monitored colonies until new queens were produced, two found very low or zero queen production, while two had good numbers (52). A significant challenge upon release is parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates reported as high as 79% in one UK trial (52). There is currently no evidence available on the effects of reintroducing just the queens (51).",

Proximity to floral resources is critical; one study estimated that nest boxes must be within 150 to 600 metres of forage (47). Nest box design also affects productivity, with one trial showing that reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes produced more bees than plastic-lined or paper tube designs, which were susceptible to mould and parasitism (47). However, another trial found cardboard straws were more productive than grooved boards for a specific bee species (47). High rates of parasitism and predation are a major factor, with overall mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% in some studies. Finally, competition from introduced species, such as European earwigs and non-native bees, can reduce use by native bees (47).",

    "answer": "There is limited and mixed evidence for the landscape-scale effects of bee conservation actions. One large trial found a positive landscape-scale effect, showing that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was correlated with the number of nectar and pollen agri-environment agreements across a 10 km grid square (21). In contrast, another trial found that bee numbers and species richness were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches (17). Furthermore, two UK trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced at the farm scale by the presence of agri-environment schemes (24).",

    "question": "What unintended negative consequences or limitations have been identified when providing artificial nest boxes for bees?",
    "answer": "Several limitations and negative consequences have been documented for artificial nest boxes. For solitary bees, high rates of mortality from parasites and predators are a key issue, with rates as high as 56% recorded in one study (47). Certain nest designs, like those with plastic linings, can increase susceptibility to parasitism or mould (47). Nest boxes can also be colonized by non-native species, such as European earwigs and introduced leafcutter bees, sometimes more commonly than by native bees (47). For bumblebees reintroduced in nest boxes, social parasitism by cuckoo bees can be very high, reaching 79% in one trial (52).",

    "question": "What is the most effective design for an artificial nest box intended for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that nest boxes entirely buried 5-10 cm underground with a 30-80 cm long entrance pipe are generally the most effective design for bumblebees. Seven trials testing this design found occupancy rates between 6% and 58%. In contrast, wooden surface or above-ground boxes, which are commonly marketed, appear less effective, with several trials showing very low occupancy rates (0-2.5%), and studies that directly compared designs found underground boxes were more readily occupied (48).",

    "question": "What are the documented effects on wild bees of introducing agri-environment schemes on European farmland?",
    "answer": "The evidence for the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in Europe is mixed. Four replicated trials showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land under schemes such as the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas (24). However, four other replicated trials found that bee numbers or species were not enhanced by schemes such as meadow bird agreements in the Netherlands or 6m wide grass strips in England (24). On a wider landscape scale, two UK trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under these schemes (24). One trial showed that hedges managed under a Scottish scheme did not attract more queen bumblebees than conventional hedges (15).",

    "question": "How does sowing agricultural forage plants on field margins compare to sowing native wildflower mixes in terms of benefits for bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Direct comparisons suggest that mixes of agricultural forage plants, including legumes, attract greater numbers of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). However, one small trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots with a perennial wildflower seed mix over an annual forage plant mix (19). Furthermore, the value of margins sown with agricultural legumes may degrade over a few years, requiring re-sowing (18).",

    "question": "What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence success. For captive rearing, the pollen diet is important; one trial showed that buff-tailed bumblebees fed freshly frozen pollen produced larger, more successful queens than those fed dried pollen, and other trials showed pollen with higher protein content led to more offspring (50). Upon reintroduction to the wild, social parasitism by cuckoo bees can be a major issue, with rates as high as 79% in one UK trial. This trial suggested parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate resource availability later in the season (52).",
