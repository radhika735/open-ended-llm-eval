    "answer": "Leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with UK studies finding it increased bird numbers and invertebrate diversity (132). In contrast, raising the mowing height is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness'. While some UK studies found it increased Eurasian skylark productivity, other trials found it had no effect on foraging birds or invertebrates (138).",

Similarly, for wet meadow restoration, positive effects have been seen within five years, but other studies found restoration was incomplete after 9 or even 20 years (119).

    "question": "What is the extent of the evidence for the effectiveness of managing or planting new hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland?",
    "answer": "The evidence for managing existing hedges is quite strong. Ten studies found that management for wildlife, such as reduced cutting, increased berry yields and the diversity or abundance of plants, invertebrates, and birds. However, five studies found no effect, and two found mixed or adverse effects (116). Evidence for planting new hedges is more limited. Two studies found newly planted hedges had higher beetle or spider abundance and plant diversity than crop fields or margins. Other studies found they could act as dispersal corridors for some invertebrates and that pest outbreaks were lower in areas with new hedges (538).",

    "question": "How do farm-level agri-environment scheme options scale up to benefit biodiversity at the landscape level?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests landscape-scale effects are variable. A large trial found that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was positively correlated with the number of 'pollen and nectar' agri-environment agreements within a 10 km grid square (362). Monitoring of the Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas scheme, which requires farmers to manage at least 7% of their land for conservation, found mixed results at a landscape scale. Some bird species increased, but others showed no effect or decreased (145). A UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local, but not a landscape-scale, effect on bee numbers (700).",

    "question": "Following the restoration of grassland from other land uses on European farmland, what is the typical timeframe to see changes in plant communities?",
    "answer": "The timeframe for restoration varies. In projects to restore species-rich, semi-natural grassland, some positive changes have been seen in less than five years, with more significant restoration taking up to 10 years. However, six studies noted limited or slow changes, and restored grasslands could still differ from existing species-rich grasslands after 60 years (133). For wet meadow restoration, positive effects on plant communities have also been observed within five years. However, other studies found restoration was incomplete after five, nine, or even 20 years (119).",

    "answer": "Evidence for the effectiveness of controlling mammal populations on farmland wildlife is mixed. For controlling grey squirrels (106) and managing wild deer numbers (111), no evidence has been captured regarding their effects on farmland wildlife. For American mink, a systematic review found trapping appears effective for reducing mink populations, and one large-scale programme successfully eradicated mink over a large area, which may have been associated with localized water vole expansions (107). More broadly, controlling predatory mammals can increase the abundance, productivity, and survival of some bird species, although effects are not always consistent across all species (699).",

    "question": "For improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, what is the comparative evidence between reducing management intensity versus restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland?",
    "answer": "Both reducing management intensity and actively restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland show benefits for invertebrates. Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands, which includes lowering chemical inputs and delaying mowing, has been found in multiple studies to benefit some or all invertebrate groups studied (69). Similarly, restoring species-rich grassland has been shown to result in higher ground beetle abundance and increased pollinating insect density and diversity compared to other grassland types (133). However, some studies for both interventions reported mixed or no effects for certain invertebrate groups, indicating that outcomes can be variable (69, 133).",

    "question": "In the Netherlands, what are the most effective management strategies for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands?",
    "answer": "Several management strategies in the Netherlands aim to benefit wading birds. 'Mosaic management', which coordinates delayed and staggered mowing across farms, was found to change northern lapwing population trends from decreases to increases and improve black-tailed godwit productivity (130). Direct payments per clutch for farmland birds led to higher hatching success for northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit, though evidence for overall population increases was limited (146). More generally, raising water levels in ditches or grassland has been associated with increased numbers of breeding birds (121). Maintaining traditional water meadows has been shown to increase populations of northern lapwing and black-tailed godwit, though some studies noted pre-existing differences in bird numbers or low productivity (696).",

    "question": "What are the documented benefits and limitations of creating uncropped plots in arable fields for wildlife?",
    "answer": "Creating uncropped plots provides documented benefits, particularly for birds and arable plants. Smaller 'skylark plots' have been shown to increase skylark population size, breeding density, and success, as well as benefiting some plants and invertebrates (540). Larger cultivated, uncropped plots, sometimes called 'lapwing plots', provide habitat for nesting northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, and grey partridge, and can increase the establishment and abundance of rare arable plants (562). However, there are limitations. Some studies found no significant benefit of skylark plots for certain invertebrates or seed-eating songbirds (540). Similarly, uncropped cultivated plots were found to have no effect on many farmland bird species in one study, and pernicious weeds were more common in these areas in another (562).",
