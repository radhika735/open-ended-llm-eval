Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards and vineyards can reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff (1382). Planting buffer strips may also reduce nitrate in runoff from pastures (1387). Conversely, some soil additions can increase nutrient loss. Adding compost, manure, sewage sludge, or slurry can lead to increased nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium in runoff or leached water (1377, 1378, 1379, 1380). Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic can reduce nitrate loss in some cases (1381).",

    "question": "What conservation actions can be implemented along watercourses on Mediterranean farmland to benefit biodiversity, and what is the evidence?",
    "answer": "Restoring habitat along watercourses is one key action. Evidence suggests it is likely to be beneficial for overall biodiversity, with studies showing increases in bird populations over time and similar reptile and mammal species numbers compared to remnant sites, but potentially lower plant cover and fewer native ant species in restored areas [1416]. Planting buffer strips is another option, which has been shown to reduce sediment and some pathogens in runoff, and increase soil moisture, potentially benefiting local habitats [1387, 1372].",

    "answer": "Using organic instead of inorganic fertilizers may be beneficial, as some studies found lower nitrous oxide emissions and increased methane absorption [1366]. Crop rotations have also been found to lower nitrous oxide and methane emissions [1368]. Conversely, several actions appear harmful. Adding compost, manure, sewage sludge, or slurry can increase emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, or both [1362, 1363, 1364, 1365].

Planting flowers is another option; four studies reported more natural enemies in or near fields with flower strips (1400). Planting hedgerows may also be effective, with one study finding more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to weedy edges (1401).",

    "question": "How does planting flowers compare to planting hedgerows for supporting pollinators on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Both actions appear beneficial for pollinators. Planting hedgerows is rated as 'Beneficial', with studies showing higher seed-set in adjacent crops from native bee visitation and more bee and syrphid fly species in fields with hedgerows (1407). Planting flowers is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with evidence showing more pollinators visiting adjacent crops and more wild bees within the flower strips themselves (1406). The evidence for hedgerows more directly links the action to a crop production outcome (seed-set), while evidence for flower strips focuses more on increasing pollinator abundance and activity (1406, 1407).",
