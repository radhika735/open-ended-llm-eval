    "question": "To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?",
    "answer": "Both actions are rated as likely to be beneficial. Cutting forest plantations alone was evaluated in four studies, which found it increased cover of some herbs like cottongrass and sedges, and increased overall plant species richness in fens (1731). Combining tree removal with rewetting has been evaluated in eleven studies and was found to change plant community composition, increase wetland-characteristic plants, and increase cover of Sphagnum moss and herbs like cottongrass. However, effects on overall plant richness were mixed in these studies (1732).",

Two studies found burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). However, there are documented negative impacts. Two other replicated studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774).

Spreading moss fragments on the surface (1821) is rated as 'Beneficial', with multiple studies finding that this technique successfully establishes Sphagnum moss cover, although success can be variable and may depend on other factors like mulching.",

Completely excluding livestock from degraded peatlands is likely beneficial, though many studies found no effect on key herb or moss cover (1734). An alternative with some evidence is to reduce the intensity of grazing; one study found this increased total vegetation and shrub cover (1735). Other potential alternatives, such as changing the type of livestock (1736) or changing the season of grazing (1737), have no evidence to support their effectiveness. Therefore, reducing grazing intensity is the main evidence-based alternative to complete exclusion.",

Directly planting mosses, such as Sphagnum-dominated sods, has been shown to result in high survival and increased moss cover (1818). Adding loose Sphagnum moss fragments to the surface is also beneficial, with studies reporting established Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to over 90% (1821). Similarly, adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum is beneficial, resulting in cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% (1822). The moss layer transfer technique, which combines spreading vegetation fragments with rewetting, reprofiling, mulching and fertilizing, is also likely to be beneficial, with one study showing it resulted in greater moss cover than an unrestored area (1804). The available evidence does not allow for a direct comparison of which method is most effective.",
