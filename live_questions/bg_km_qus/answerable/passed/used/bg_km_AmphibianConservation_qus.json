    "question": "What actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

    "question": "How do different partial harvesting methods in USA forests compare to clearcutting in their impact on salamander populations?",
    "answer": "A meta-analysis found that partial harvesting, including shelterwood harvesting and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 852). Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",
