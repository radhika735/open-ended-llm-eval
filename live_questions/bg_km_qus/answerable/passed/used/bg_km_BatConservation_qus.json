    "question": "What evidence exists for the effectiveness of different strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats?",
    "answer": "There is limited but emerging evidence for treating bats directly, but no evidence for the effectiveness of most other preventative strategies. Two studies found that treating infected little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in lab or field settings, although results on disease severity were mixed (2008). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), restricting human access to caves to reduce spread (1010), decontaminating equipment (2006), treating hibernacula environments (2007), or using captive breeding to supplement affected populations (2009).",

    "question": "To mitigate the impact of road and railway developments, what structures can be installed to help bats cross safely?",
    "answer": "A variety of crossing structures can be installed, with varying effectiveness. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road at traffic height (976). Overpasses are also used, but again, studies found many bats crossed elsewhere or below traffic height (977). One study found a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979). In contrast, bat gantries were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with most bats crossing below them at a dangerous height (978). Additionally, maintaining existing roosts within road bridges (1966) or creating new roosting spaces (1967) can support bat populations affected by such infrastructure.",
