[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do long-term and temporary fishery closures compare in their effects on marine fish abundance?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, long-term fishery closures show more positive effects on marine fish abundance compared to temporary closures. Long-term closures (6-8 years) demonstrated higher abundance in 2 of 7 fish species in the Gulf of Maine and Bismark Sea (action 2655). In contrast, temporary closures showed no increase in fish biomass or abundance for cod in the Atlantic Ocean over nine years (action 2664), and no increase in invertebrate biomass at sites seasonally closed to fishing in the English Channel (action 2098). However, both temporary and long-term closures showed mixed or neutral results for some species - temporary closures had no effect on cod survival or condition (action 2664), while long-term closures showed either similar or lower abundance for certain species like monkfish and salmon (action 2655). The evidence suggests that longer protection periods may be necessary to see measurable increases in fish abundance, though responses vary by species.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the observed effects on fish abundance and diversity from prohibiting most or all fishing within Marine Protected Areas?\nanswer: Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with complete fishing prohibitions have demonstrated significant positive effects on fish abundance and diversity. A systematic review of 79 studies examining MPAs that prohibited all types of fishing found that 30 of 54 site comparison studies reported higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of fish species compared to fished areas, with effects observed up to 25 years or more after implementation. These positive effects were consistently found for both fishery-targeted and non-targeted species. Additionally, 14 of 20 site comparison studies found higher fish species richness/diversity in MPAs with fishing prohibitions compared to fished areas. The studies also revealed that fish in no-fishing MPAs were larger overall, with 8 of 11 site comparison studies reporting larger fish sizes for most species groups monitored. However, some variation in responses was observed between different fish species and groups, with effects sometimes depending on factors such as position in the food chain, commercial target status, and size of the fish. MPAs with limited fishing exceptions showed more variable results, with some studies finding similar fish biomass and density compared to fished areas.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Separator trawls: A replicated, randomized study in the North Sea found that separator trawls separated unwanted cod from target fish species into the lower codend, where a larger mesh size allowed more unwanted smaller cod to escape capture (action 2711).\n\n2. Topless (coverless) trawls: Two of four replicated, controlled studies in the North Sea found that topless trawls reduced the catch of unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species compared to conventional trawl types. One study found that topless trawls reduced unwanted catches of larger but not smaller haddock (action 2712).\n\n3. Size-sorting escape grids: Multiple studies in the North Sea showed that fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets reduced catches of unwanted cod and haddock compared to trawls without grids. However, results were mixed on whether this improved size-selection for these species specifically (action 2720).\n\n4.

Mesh escape panels (2716) showed effectiveness in 30 of 38 studies, with 9 studies demonstrating improved size selectivity for species like Atlantic cod and haddock, though results varied with panel position and design. Size-sorting escape grids (2720) were effective in 14 of 17 studies at reducing unwanted catch of various species including cod, haddock, and whiting, with improved size-selection reported for haddock in 2 of 3 relevant studies, though performance varied by species. Large supported openings (2723) were effective in 6 of 7 studies at reducing unwanted catch of species like red snapper and other fish, though specific size-selectivity improvements were not as prominently featured in the evidence. When used in combination (2726), grids and large openings together were effective in 3 of 4 studies at reducing unwanted catch. The evidence suggests that mesh escape panels have the broadest evidence base for size-selectivity improvements, while grids show strong performance for unwanted catch reduction, and large supported openings are effective but with more limited evidence for size-selectivity specifically.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Prohibition of static fishing gear: One study in the Coral Sea found that areas closed to non-towed fishing gears had higher overall shark abundance when sampled with longlines compared to areas where commercial gillnets were permitted. Shark length was greater for two of five species/groups in these closed areas. Prohibition of line fishing: One study in the Indian Ocean found that prohibiting offshore line fishing and all other boat-based fishing resulted in higher abundances of four fish species that were over-exploited by line fishing compared to areas where boat-based line and spear fishing was permitted. The evidence suggests both types of prohibitions can have positive effects on fish abundance, but they target different aspects - static gear prohibition appears beneficial for shark populations, while line fishing prohibition helps recover species specifically over-exploited by line fishing.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study found that after 14 years of closure to bottom trawling, recruitment of young red mullet had increased. However, another study found that closing an area to bottom trawling did not increase recruitment or survival of young haddock seven years after closure compared to trawled areas.\n\nMediterranean Sea: Studies in the Mediterranean show generally positive results. After a 14-year closure to bottom trawling, adult red mullet showed increased biomass and larger sizes. Additionally, after the closure of an area to bottom trawling, recruitment of young red mullet had increased, though this was not consistent across all fish groups.\n\nIndian Ocean (Tasmania, Kenya): Research from the Indian Ocean region shows variable results depending on habitat type and individual fish groups. Studies found that closing areas to towed bottom gears for 3-14 years had effects on fish size that varied between individual fish groups and with habitat type, compared to fished areas.\n\nOverall Effectiveness: The effectiveness of bottom fishing gear prohibitions appears to be highly variable across regions and is influenced by several factors including the duration of closure (ranging from 3 to 15 years in these studies), habitat type, and specific fish species or groups studied.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Separator trawls were examined in two studies - one in the North Sea found they separated unwanted cod from target species into a lower codend with larger mesh sizes that allowed more smaller cod to escape, while another in the Atlantic Ocean found they caught less of one of two unwanted fish species when fitted with square-mesh escape panels. Topless trawls were studied more extensively with four studies across the North Sea, Gulf of Maine, and Baltic Sea regions. These studies showed mixed but generally positive results - two studies found they reduced unwanted Atlantic cod catch and discards of commercial species, one found they reduced catches of larger but not smaller haddock and larger cod only in one case, and another found discarded catches were reduced for one of four commercial species.

Similarly, for fish diversity, the South Atlantic study found no difference in overall fish diversity between the 40-year protected area and fished areas, while research from other regions showed varying results. For abundance specifically, the Tasman Sea studies produced mixed findings - one study found most fish species had lower abundance two years after closure compared to before, while another found fish abundance varied over time with some groups higher than others.

Temporary closures (Action ID 2664) showed mixed results with one study finding no increase in cod biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years compared to fished areas, while another study found that during a temporary grouper fishery closure, spear fisher catch numbers of other fish groups (herbivores) increased, indicating they were being targeted more compared to the open season. Catch rates of red mullet and total catch increased after temporary closures in targeted fisheries over 10 years, but European hake showed no change.\n\nLong-term fishery closures (Action ID 2655) demonstrated more consistent positive effects, with studies showing higher weights of young salmon returning to rivers five years after closure in the Norwegian Sea, and higher abundance of some fish species in closed areas compared to open areas after six to eight years. However, effects varied by species with some showing no change or even lower abundance. Long-term closures also reduced unwanted catch of cod and reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel in the North Sea.\n\nComprehensive marine protected areas with complete fishing prohibition (Action IDs 2224 and 2682) showed the most robust positive effects after 1-25+ years, with 30 of 54 studies finding higher abundances of fish compared to fished areas, while temporary closures showed more variable and often limited benefits.

These areas, when enforced for 1-25+ years, demonstrated different fish community composition and higher species richness/diversity compared to fished areas in 14 of 20 studies. Thirty of 54 studies found higher abundances (density and biomass) of fish, including fishery-targeted species, though effects varied by species, food chain position, and habitat type. Importantly, 8 of 11 studies found larger fish overall and larger individuals of most species monitored.\n\n**Temporary Fishery Closures** specifically targeting spawning periods showed limited effectiveness. Five studies found no increase in spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition of cod over nine years following temporary closures compared to fished areas. However, one study reported that tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of their time inside seasonally closed spawning areas, providing protection during critical periods.\n\n**Protecting Spawning Fish from Capture** through seasonal closures yielded mixed results. Four studies found no increase in Atlantic cod spawning stock biomass, survival, or length composition over nine years following implementation. However, two studies showed that closed spawning and nursery areas were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod during spawning periods and by young school sharks for up to 80% of time.\n\n**Prohibition of Bottom Fishing Gears** in specific areas showed variable results across three studies. One study found higher numbers of larger, older cod after 15 years, while another found species-specific responses varying with depth and temperature. Fish densities showed no consistent effect after 2-7 years in protected versus non-protected areas.\n\n**Zonation Systems** within MPAs allowing different activity levels showed positive effects on specific species, with crustaceans like lobsters showing increased abundance and size in no-fishing zones compared to areas with fewer restrictions.\n\n**Periodic Fishing** (allowing fishing only during specific periods) showed promising results in one study, with areas fished only for short periods having greater fish biomass than continuously fished areas and similar biomass to permanently closed areas.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
