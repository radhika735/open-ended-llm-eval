One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that using noise deterrents along with tree nets reduced orangutan crop raiding, and a study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that chasing gorillas with random noise resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to areas near protected forest. In contrast, there is currently no evidence available for the effectiveness of using bright lights to deter primate crop-raiding. The search found no studies that directly and quantitatively tested bright lights as a deterrent method, making it impossible to assess their effectiveness for this purpose.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For selective logging versus clear-cutting, one site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest that had been logged at low intensity than in a forest logged at high intensity (Action ID: 1485). One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging (Action ID: 1485). However, one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest that had been logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity (Action ID: 1485). For community control measures, a site comparison study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that community control was more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting, including primates, compared to the nearby national park (Action ID: 1482). A before-and-after study in Cameroon found that no incidents of gorilla poaching occurred over three years after implementation of community control and monitoring of illegal activities (Action ID: 1482). A site comparison study in Nigeria found that there were more gorillas and chimpanzees in an area managed by a community conservation organisation than in areas not managed by local communities (Action ID: 1482). However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of many other proposed conservation actions, including using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas, incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas, providing domestic meat to logging workers to reduce hunting, closing non-essential roads after logging operations, reducing forestry team sizes, certifying forest concessions as primate friendly, implementing road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat, avoiding slashing of specific vegetation types, and implementing small and dispersed logging compartments.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of installing different types of bridges to mitigate road impacts on arboreal and terrestrial primates?\nanswer: Based on available evidence, different types of bridges show varying effectiveness in mitigating road impacts on arboreal and terrestrial primates. For rope and pole bridges specifically designed for arboreal primates, several studies demonstrate positive outcomes. One study in Brazil found that black lion tamarins and capuchins successfully used pole bridges to cross roads, while a before-and-after study in Belize documented population increases in black howler monkeys following the construction of pole bridges over human-made gaps. Additionally, all six monitored lemur species in Madagascar used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. For rope bridges between canopies, nine studies across Australia, Brazil, and Peru documented that rope bridges were used by a range of mammal species, with seven studies showing between three and 25 species utilizing the bridges. One study confirmed that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not experience high predation rates during crossing attempts.\n\nFor green bridges (overpasses), no evidence was found for effects specifically on primate populations, highlighting a significant research gap in this area. However, studies on general overpass structures for terrestrial mammals show promising results. Twenty-two studies found that overpasses were used by a wide range of mammals including rodents, carnivores, ungulates, bears, and marsupials, with four studies demonstrating that overpasses combined with fencing reduced vehicle-mammal collisions. Similarly, tunnel and underpass installations showed effectiveness for various terrestrial mammal species, though specific data for primates is limited.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Face-mask wearing by researchers and tourists can help avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates (Action 1537). Ensuring that all personnel and visitors are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy, with sick individuals prohibited from visiting primates, helps prevent disease spread (Action 1546). Limiting the time that researchers and tourists spend with habituated animals reduces prolonged exposure opportunities (Action 1539). Regular disinfection of clothes, boots, and other equipment prevents pathogen transfer (Action 1547). Keeping a safety distance from habituated animals minimizes close contact that could facilitate disease transmission (Action 1538). Implementing a strict no-feeding policy for wild primates prevents close contact during feeding activities that could spread diseases (Action 1502). Wearing gloves when handling primate food items or tools provides additional protection (Action 1548). Implementing quarantine procedures for people arriving and leaving sites is another potential measure, though evidence for its effectiveness is currently lacking (Action 1540).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Continuous feeding also resulted in different diets for black-and-white ruffed lemurs compared to wild groups after one year in Madagascar. \n\nSeasonal or resource-scarce period feeding demonstrated positive survival outcomes: chimpanzees in Republic of Congo survived at least five years, wild olive baboons in Kenya survived at least 17 years after drought-period feeding, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar maintained wild-like diets. \n\nTime-limited feeding showed variable results: chimpanzee populations increased after two-month post-reintroduction feeding in Tanzania, while golden lion tamarin populations declined after one year of supplementation in Brazil. Survival rates were mixed across multiple studies, with some showing majority survival for various primate species including gorillas, chimpanzees, and other primates across multiple countries, while four studies found only minority survival rates. \n\nSocial context appears important: monkeys completed enrichment tasks faster when in social groups compared to feeding alone, and consumed more unfamiliar foods during initial encounters when groupmates were present.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does a permanent human presence at a site influence the success of primate conservation efforts?\nanswer: A permanent human presence at primate conservation sites has shown mixed effects on conservation success. Studies indicate that permanent staff presence can contribute to positive outcomes, with one study in Belize showing black howler monkey numbers increased by 138% over 13 years with permanent reserve staff (Action 1517). Similarly, continuous health monitoring with permanent vets on site contributed to a 168% increase in mountain gorilla populations over 41 years in Rwanda, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo (Action 1554). However, permanent human presence is not universally beneficial - one study in Kenya found that Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite permanent staff presence (Action 1517), and another study in Thailand showed a reintroduced lar gibbon population declined over three years with permanent staff present (Action 1517). The practice of habituating primates to human presence, which is often necessary for research and tourism, has also shown mixed results - while mountain gorilla populations increased following habituation (Action 1519), an introduced golden lion tamarin population in Brazil declined after habituation (Action 1519).

Additionally, black-and-white ruffed lemurs reared in cages showed dietary patterns that did not overlap with wild lemurs. In contrast, primates born and raised in free-ranging environments showed better outcomes: two out of three black lion tamarins survived over four months, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed dietary overlap with wild lemurs. Primates with limited free-ranging experience showed mixed results: while most black-and-white ruffed lemurs died over five years, most western lowland gorillas survived over periods of nine months to four years.

However, evidence from translocating other problem mammals (such as bears) away from residential areas provides relevant insights. Studies show that translocated mammals often have poor survival outcomes - fewer than half of black bears translocated from conflict situations survived after one year, and grizzly bears translocated away from conflict situations had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears. A significant drawback is that many translocated mammals return to their original capture locations and continue causing nuisance, with some black bears returning up to six times following translocation. In the case of leopards translocated from human-dominated areas, attacks on humans and livestock actually increased compared to before translocation. Brown bears that returned to capture areas continued to cause nuisance problems, suggesting that relocation may not effectively resolve human-wildlife conflict long-term.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Medium-term monitoring revealed survival patterns over 2-7 years, with some populations showing persistence for 4-7 years while others experienced higher mortality rates. Long-term population changes have been tracked over extended periods, with one chimpanzee population in The Gambia showing increase over 25 years, black-and-white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar showing population persistence over 55 years, and orangutan populations in Malaysia showing decline over 33 years. Specific survival outcomes varied by rearing conditions, with cage-reared golden lion tamarins showing poor survival over seven years, while gorillas with limited free-ranging experience showed survival over nine months to four years.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To improve the effectiveness of anti-poaching patrols for primate conservation, what are the documented outcomes of providing better equipment versus providing training?\nanswer: Based on the documented evidence, both providing better equipment and training to anti-poaching ranger patrols have shown positive outcomes for primate conservation, though they are typically implemented together with other interventions. Training outcomes include: no gorillas killed over 21 months in Uganda alongside other interventions (1477); increased immature gorilla populations in Rwanda alongside other interventions (1477); increased hoolock gibbon populations in India alongside other interventions (1477); and no primate poaching incidents over three years in Cameroon alongside other interventions (1477). Equipment provision outcomes include: increased gorilla populations in Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda alongside other interventions (1476); no gorillas killed for 21 months in Uganda alongside other interventions (1476); and increased immature gorillas with decreased snares in Rwanda alongside other interventions (1476). Both approaches appear to be effective when implemented as part of comprehensive conservation strategies, with similar positive outcomes reported including population increases and reduced poaching incidents.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence base for actions designed to reduce primate mortality and habitat fragmentation from roads and other transportation corridors?\nanswer: The evidence for actions to reduce primate mortality and habitat fragmentation from roads includes several studies with varying effectiveness. Rope or pole (canopy) bridges have documented success, with one study in Brazil showing black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road, a before-and-after study in Belize finding that a black howler monkey population increased after pole bridge construction over man-made gaps, and a before-and-after study in Madagascar finding that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines. Rope bridges between canopies were used by 3-25 species across nine studies in Australia, Brazil and Peru, with arboreal marsupials not suffering high predation rates when using them. For general road mortality reduction, barrier fencing along roads reduced mammal vehicle collisions in three controlled studies in the USA, Germany and Brazil, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that roadside fencing with one-way gates reduced deer-vehicle collisions. A review across the USA, Canada and Sweden found that longer roadside fencing led to greater reduction of collisions between large mammals and cars. However, road mitigation effectiveness varies by species and design, with some studies showing no significant effects. No evidence was found for primate-specific measures like speed limits in high primate density areas, speed bumps, or primate road signage.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the comparative outcomes of providing primates with continuous supplementary food versus providing it only during scarce periods or for a limited time?\nanswer: Comparative outcomes of different supplementary feeding approaches for primates show mixed results across all methods. Providing food only during scarce periods or for limited time periods has shown success with chimpanzees surviving at least five years, baboons surviving 17 years post-translocation, and lemurs maintaining wild-type diets. Continuous feeding has produced both increases and decreases in primate populations depending on location, with most primates surviving but showing altered diets compared to wild groups. Stopping supplementary feeding entirely led to population declines in Japanese macaques.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
