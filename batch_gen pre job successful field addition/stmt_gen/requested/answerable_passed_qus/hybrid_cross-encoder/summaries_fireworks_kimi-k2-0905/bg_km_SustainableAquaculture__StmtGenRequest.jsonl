[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What methods are available to control disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms?\nanswer: Studies have identified several methods for controlling disease and sea lice in Atlantic salmon farms. For sea lice control, two studies in Ireland found mixed effects of using cleaner wrasse - corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments, while rockcook wrasse were ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Altering lighting intensity was found to reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice. Fallowing systems showed mixed results, with one study in Scotland recording lower lice numbers but another in Australia finding no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease. For disease prevention and control, vaccinations were found to increase survival rates against various pathogens including Aeromonas salmonicida spp. achromogenes, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia in studies from Iceland, Norway, Australia and Canada. Using probiotics and immunostimulants showed benefits including increased survival when salmon were exposed to disease-causing bacteria, with one study finding a 28% reduction in lice infection when fish were fed a diet with 28% plant-based protein, and a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added. Freshwater bathing to reduce amoebic gill disease showed mixed results, with one study finding reduced amoebae on gills for up to 10 days, while another found no difference between treated and untreated salmon.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do plant-based and bacterial protein alternatives to fish meal compare in terms of their effect on Atlantic salmon growth rates in Norway?\nanswer: Based on multiple studies from Norway, plant-based protein alternatives to fish meal generally result in decreased growth rates in Atlantic salmon. Six studies found reduced growth rates with plant-based diets, while three studies found similar growth rates compared to fish meal controls. Plant-based diets also showed reduced final body weights in four studies, with mixed effects on feeding efficiency - some studies showed lowered efficiency while others showed increased efficiency. Fish meal reduction studies found no significant differences in final weights.\n\nBacterial protein alternatives showed more favorable results. Two replicated controlled studies in Norway found similar growth rates when bacterial protein replaced up to 25% of fish meal, though 50% replacement resulted in lower growth rates.

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Beyond growth rates, what other biological effects have been observed in salmon fed diets with krill or plant-based proteins instead of fish meal?\nanswer: Beyond growth rates, several biological effects have been observed in salmon fed diets with alternative protein sources. For plant-based proteins, studies found that survival rates and appetite were not affected, but morphology of the distal intestine was altered in two randomized, replicated, controlled studies (Action ID 924). Digestibility of feed components was found to be lower in two replicated, controlled studies when diets contained plant proteins compared to fish meal (Action ID 924). The condition of salmon was increased in plant-based protein diets in one study but reduced in two other studies (Action ID 924). Two replicated studies found lowered levels of feeding efficiency in salmon fed plant-based protein diets compared to fish meal diets (Action ID 924). For krill meal diets, the number of aerobic bacteria in the hindgut of salmon was higher and the composition of bacterial flora was different compared to fish meal diets (Action ID 916). Additionally, when salmon were fed diets containing 28% plant-based protein combined with beta-glucans, lice infection levels decreased by 28% compared to controls (Action ID 732).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What non-chemical methods can be used to manage pests and biofouling on salmon farms?\nanswer: Non-chemical pest management methods for salmon farms include using cleaner wrasse as natural control agents, with studies showing mixed effectiveness for sea lice control (Action ID: 738). Fallowing systems can reduce parasites and disease, with one Scottish study recording lower lice numbers on salmon in cages using fallowing (Action ID: 1026). Bird pest management employs acoustic deterrents like distress calls, visual deterrents such as scarecrows, and trained raptors, though birds often become habituated to these methods (Action ID: 244). Specific biofouling management actions include preventing biofouling organism attachment and removing biofouling organisms, though no studies have evaluated their effectiveness yet (Action IDs: 2162, 2163). Additional preventive measures involve sourcing disease-free juveniles and implementing regular inspections to avoid introducing problematic species (Action IDs: 2159, 2157).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors influence the success of non-pesticide methods for controlling sea lice on salmon farms?\nanswer: Studies show mixed effectiveness of non-pesticide sea lice control methods. Cleaner wrasse effectiveness varies by species - corkwing and goldskinny wrasse were as effective as chemical treatments, while rockcook wrasse were ineffective (Action ID: 738). Lighting intensity affects lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice compared to high intensity artificial light (Action ID: 741). Dietary modifications can reduce lice infection - feeding salmon a diet with 28% plant-based protein reduced lice by 28%, and adding beta-glucans decreased infection by a further 28% (Action ID: 732). Fallowing systems showed mixed results, with one study recording lower lice numbers in Scotland but another finding no difference in mortality from Amoebic Gill Disease in Australia (Action ID: 1026).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In Norway, how do different plant-based feed alternatives, such as vegetable oils versus plant proteins, affect salmon growth and body composition?\nanswer: Studies in Norway comparing plant-based feed alternatives for salmon show distinct effects between vegetable oils and plant proteins. For vegetable oil alternatives, three replicated studies found similar or higher growth rates in salmon fed vegetable oil diets compared to fish oil diets. However, the fatty acid profile of salmon flesh reflected the oil source, with vegetable oil diets resulting in high liver lipid and low plasma lipoprotein levels and lower concentrations of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids compared to fish oil diets. Salmon fed vegetable oil-based diets also had lower concentrations of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls in their flesh.\n\nFor plant protein alternatives, six studies found that inclusion of plant-based proteins led to decreased growth rates in salmon, with four studies showing reduced final body weights compared to fish meal-based diets. Digestibility of feed components was lower with plant proteins, and morphology of the distal intestine was altered in salmon fed plant-based protein diets. However, survival rates and appetite were not affected by plant-based protein diets.\n\nBoth alternatives maintained similar feeding efficiency levels in most studies, though some studies showed either lowered or increased feeding efficiency with plant proteins depending on the specific study conditions.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
