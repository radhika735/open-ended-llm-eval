However, documented harms include: potential for higher soil compaction under reduced tillage (Action ID: 906), inconsistent or lower crop yields in some cases (Action ID: 1355, 1358), mixed effects on earthworm populations with some studies showing no difference (Action ID: 126), possible increases in greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (Action ID: 1371), inconsistent effects on invertebrate populations with some showing negative or no effects (Action ID: 126), and variable responses of weed populations (Action ID: 126).

For cover crops between crop rows (action 897), studies demonstrated increased bacterial activity, reduced erosion, enhanced soil stability, and increased soil organic matter. In contrast, cover crops in arable fields (actions 1357, 1394, 1345) when fields are empty showed more complex effects: 7 controlled studies found less water in soils with winter cover crops compared to bare plots, 5 controlled studies found reduced water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation, and 10 studies found variable nitrogen effects (10 found more nitrogen, 1 found less, 10 showed inconsistent results). Cover crops in empty fields reduced nitrate leaching in 4 studies, increased microbial biomass in 5 studies, and reduced soil erosion in 2 studies. The key difference is that between-row cover crops function as living mulches with immediate soil protection benefits, while cover crops in empty fields primarily serve to improve soil health and reduce nutrient loss during fallow periods.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Green manures (Action 908): Two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan found higher soil organic carbon or increased grain yields when green manures were grown, though these studies were limited to clay loam soils. Cover crops (Action 898): Multiple studies demonstrated benefits including increased soil organic carbon levels (Denmark and Japan-based review), higher nitrogen levels in soils regardless of whether cover crops were legumes (three studies from Australia and USA), improved soil structure and nutrient retention (three studies from Denmark, Turkey, and UK), and higher tomato yields in one USA trial. A comprehensive review (Action 1345) of 12 studies found increased organic matter (mostly measured as carbon) in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them, with additional benefits including more nitrogen in soils, increased microbial biomass, more soil organisms including earthworms, reduced soil erosion, more water-stable soil aggregates, and increased carbon accumulation in some cases. The evidence suggests both practices are beneficial, with cover crops having more extensive documentation of multiple benefits including soil structure improvement, erosion control, and biodiversity enhancement, while green manure data is more limited but shows clear benefits for soil organic carbon and yields.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Amending soil with organic processing wastes or composts (Action 891) has been shown to improve soil structure and reduce soil loss, though it may increase nutrient loss at high application rates. Adding fresh plant material or crop remains (Action 910) improves soil structure when straw is incorporated, and also increases soil organic carbon and microbial biomass. Growing cover crops when fields are empty (Action 898) improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and interconnectivity while reducing soil resistance. Adding mulch to crops (Action 887) improves soil structure and increases soil organic matter, with studies showing mulches increase soil stability and reduce erosion. Controlling traffic and traffic timing (Action 899) reduces soil compaction and increases water filtration into the soil, with research showing higher numbers of soil pores under controlled traffic systems. Using crop rotation (Action 857) and incorporating leys into crop rotation (Action 900) also contribute to improved soil health and structure on sandy-loam soils. These actions have been tested across various European locations and demonstrate measurable improvements in soil structure, porosity, stability, and resistance to erosion when implemented on sandy-loam soils.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Similarly, incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (Action 910) - which could include materials brought from elsewhere - also increases microbial biomass, improves soil structure, reduces soil loss, enhances soil nitrogen levels and organic carbon, and can increase crop yields. Both approaches show positive effects on soil organic matter, with six studies showing higher carbon levels when plant material was added, and two studies finding higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained. The key difference appears to be that crop residue retention specifically focuses on keeping existing on-site materials, while soil amendment with plant material can involve both on-site and externally sourced materials, but both approaches yield similar benefits for soil health, biodiversity, and productivity.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Adding organic amendments such as composts, manures, and crop residues consistently improves nutrient retention. Specifically, incorporating straw or compost reduces nitrate leaching while increasing soil nitrogen levels. Growing cover crops between main crops or during fallow periods significantly reduces nitrate leaching and improves nutrient retention. Adding mulch to crops increases soil stability and reduces nutrient loss through erosion control. Using formulated chemical compounds like nitrification inhibitors can reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions. Combining organic and inorganic amendments shows superior results for nutrient retention compared to either alone. Retaining crop residues rather than removing them helps maintain soil organic matter and reduces erosion, thereby preventing nutrient loss. These actions work by improving soil structure, increasing organic matter content, reducing erosion, and enhancing the soil's capacity to hold nutrients.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Research from controlled replicated trials demonstrated that adding municipal compost to semi-arid sandy loam soils greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff. Organic processing waste composts on sandy loam soils demonstrated mixed but generally positive effects. Studies showed that applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss in sandy loam soils, though this practice increased nutrient loss. Additionally, research demonstrated improved nutrient retention and increased barley yield when molasses were added to sandy loam soils.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence from the USA indicate about the effect of different agricultural practices on crop yields?\nanswer: Evidence from USA studies indicates mixed effects of different agricultural practices on crop yields. For cover crops, some studies found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops compared to without them, while others found higher yields or inconsistent differences. Cover crops with legumes showed higher yields than non-legumes. Adding compost to soil showed mixed results - some studies found higher crop yields, others found inconsistent differences or similar yields. No-till practices showed varied effects: some studies found higher yields, others found lower yields, and some found inconsistent or similar yields compared to conventional tillage. Reduced tillage studies showed higher yields for some fruits and vegetables, but results varied by crop type. Crop rotation studies showed higher yields in some comparisons but similar yields in others, with USA-specific evidence showing higher tomato yields in four-year versus two-year rotations. Ground cover in orchards/vineyards showed lower grape yields in some studies but similar yields in others. Organic fertilizer use showed lower yields compared to inorganic fertilizer in some USA studies, while others found similar yields. Planting hedgerows showed similar crop yields compared to bare/weedy edges.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
