A review of programmes in the USA and Canada found that education alone was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (action 162). However, several studies demonstrated positive outcomes from education and awareness campaigns. In the Philippines, a communication, education, and public awareness campaign led to increased Philippine crocodile populations and reduced human killing of crocodiles (action 3682). Similarly, in Costa Rica, a community-based education programme resulted in decreased poaching of leatherback turtle nests (action 3682), while in Dominica, education combined with road signs reduced road deaths of lesser Antillean iguanas (action 3682). In aquatic environments, three studies found that educational whale-watching tours and exhibitions in the North Atlantic Ocean, Bangladesh, and Peru increased participants' willingness to support marine conservation through behaviour change and donations (action 2935). However, some studies showed limited or no effectiveness, such as an information leaflet program in the USA that failed to reduce hotel energy consumption (action 3682) and awareness efforts in Taiwan that had no effect on green tree frog conservation (action 831).

Organic matter amendments demonstrate several benefits including increased microbial biomass and activity (902), higher soil organic carbon levels (902), and increased soil nutrients (902). However, in wetland environments, high amounts of compost can negatively impact plant community composition by favoring species characteristic of drier conditions and reducing plant species richness and diversity (3310), though it can increase individual tree size (3310). Manure applications show mixed effects on tree survival and growth depending on species and dose (3311).\n\nLime applications reveal predominantly negative or neutral effects. Studies found lime application decreased pine seedling survival (1259), typically reduced survival of planted fen herbs (1825), and reduced growth rates for most peat swamp tree seedlings (1825). However, some studies found lime increased survival of planted fen mosses (1825) and vegetation cover in one study (1249).\n\nFertilizer applications show variable results. Some studies found fertilizer increased tree size (1260, 3306) and growth rates (3306), while others found no significant effects on tree height, diameter, survival, or health (1260, 3306).

Using light-colored plastic tree shelters or guards can increase survival rates of planted seedlings (action 1268). Shading has also been found to increase survival of native tree seedlings (action 1269). Fertilizer application after planting shows mixed results - some studies found it increased tree size (action 1260), while others found no effect on tree survival, health, or height (action 1260). Adding lime to soil after planting had mixed effects, with one study showing decreased pine seedling survival while another found no effect on oak growth (action 1259). Improving soil quality with various enhancers had mixed effects on seedling survival and height but no effect on health (action 1153). Using weed mats showed no effect on tree seedling height (action 1267). There was no evidence found for planting a mixture of tree species to enhance survival and growth (action 1159).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of legal frameworks and public engagement initiatives for forest conservation?\nanswer: Evidence from forest conservation studies shows mixed effectiveness of legal frameworks and public engagement initiatives. For legal protection, two site comparison studies found that legally protected forests had increased tree species richness, diversity, and density of young trees in Nigeria and Iran (Action ID: 1233). However, one study found no effect on seed density and diversity in Mexico. Community-based forest management showed positive outcomes, with two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal finding that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests compared to non-community managed forests (Action ID: 1152), though one study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates. Financial incentives for community forest management demonstrated varied results: a study in Belize showed a 138% increase in black howler monkey populations over 13 years when communities received monetary benefits (Action ID: 1509), while a study across Rwanda, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo found a 28% decline in mountain gorillas over 41 years despite community development projects. Public engagement through awareness campaigns showed some positive impacts, including increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK, and successfully reached 50,000+ people annually in some programs (Action ID: 831), though one study found no effect on a green tree frog project in Taiwan. Community engagement in conservation activities demonstrated positive outcomes for reptile populations, including reduced poaching of turtle eggs in Mozambique and Costa Rica, and fewer crocodile killings in the Philippines (Action ID: 3681). However, several actions lacked sufficient evidence, including legal protection from development (Action ID: 1169) and forest certification programs (Action ID: 1500).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Research on logging/removing trees found that it decreases epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility (Action ID 1270). Studies on tree thinning showed it decreases epiphytic plant abundance and species richness, with three out of four studies reporting these negative effects in Canada, Finland, and Sweden (Action ID 1212). The evidence indicates that both complete tree removal and partial thinning operations have measurable detrimental effects on non-vascular plant communities, particularly affecting epiphytic species that depend on forest structure and microclimate conditions maintained by intact tree canopies.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What management actions are available to aid forest recovery after a wildfire, and what is known about their effectiveness?\nanswer: Based on available evidence, several management actions can be implemented to aid forest recovery after wildfire:\n\nTree thinning after wildfire has shown mixed effectiveness. Five replicated, controlled studies found that thinning increased plant species richness in Spain, increased cover of aspen saplings in Canada, and decreased mortality of pine seedlings in Israel. However, one study in the USA found it decreased plant biomass.\n\nRemoving burnt trees and branches did not show significant benefit for European wild rabbit populations in Spain compared to leaving branches in place.\n\nReplanting native trees in logged areas showed mixed results, with one study in Ghana finding similar species richness but lower diversity compared to naturally regenerating secondary forest nine years after replanting.\n\nPlanting trees after wildfire currently has no available evidence for its effectiveness on forest recovery.\n\nRetaining dead trees after uprooting showed that areas where trees were left on site were used more by desert cottontails in the USA compared to cleared areas.\n\nUsing prescribed fire for forest restoration and maintenance has been studied more extensively. Eight of 14 studies found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while four studies showed mixed effects depending on species, year, or season of burn. Three studies found increased abundance or species numbers from prescribed fires.\n\nForest restoration or creation programs showed variable results across different ecosystems and restoration methods, with some studies finding increased species richness and abundance while others found mixed or negative effects depending on restoration approach and comparison groups.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Studies from Ethiopia and Nepal found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests compared to forests not managed by local communities (Action 1152). However, a replicated site comparison study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (Action 1152).
