[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Does the effectiveness of using fences to exclude livestock from shrublands vary between different countries?\nanswer: Evidence from multiple countries indicates varied outcomes when fencing is used to exclude livestock from shrublands. In the UK, fencing increased shrub cover or abundance and increased heather biomass and height, while effects on species richness and grass cover were mixed, with some studies reporting lower species richness in fenced areas and declines or increases in grass cover depending on the study [1545]. In Germany, fencing increased shrub biomass [1545]. In Denmark, heather presence or cover was higher inside fences [1545]. In Finland, fencing did not alter abundance of herb species and often did not change grass cover [1545]. In the USA, results were mixed: one study found decreased woody plant cover with fencing, several found mixed or no effects on shrub cover, and findings on grass and forb cover ranged from no change to decreases or increases depending on the study [1545]. Across additional studies that included shrublands among other habitats in the USA, Israel, Chile, Spain, and Australia, excluding grazers sometimes increased plant biomass, cover, or abundance, but some Australian studies found decreases under exclusion, and several US grassland studies found no differences; for diversity, some studies in Israel, Spain, and the USA found more species or fewer non-natives with exclusion, while other studies across Australia, Israel, Spain, and the USA found fewer species under exclusion, and some studies reported no differences or only changes in community composition [2292].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Spraying herbicide followed by sowing seeds of shrubland species increased shrub seedling numbers and increased the number of native plant species; effects on non\u2011native grass cover were mixed across studies [1644]. Planting individual plants did not increase native plant cover compared to seeding or a seed+planting combination in one US study, but in South Africa increased plant cover (not species richness), and one US study reported most planted individuals survived after one year [1697].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of various soil amendments, such as adding mulch, fertilizer, or manure, when restoring shrublands?\nanswer: Adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and did not change grass cover in one randomized, controlled study in the USA (ID 1694). Applying manures or agricultural composts increased microbial biomass and respiration in several controlled, replicated studies; reduced soil loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments; often reduced nutrient loss and raised nitrogen, though one study found higher nitrate leaching; increased soil carbon; had mixed effects on soil organic matter; improved soil physical properties and aggregation in one study; and increased crop yields in multiple studies (ID 911). Adding manure increased soil organic matter in several studies but showed mixed results in others; increased nitrogen and potassium in some comparisons with mixed effects on phosphorus; had mixed effects on soil pH; reduced erosion and increased soil stability in some studies; and increased carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in individual studies (ID 1363). Mixing organic and inorganic amendments (e.g., manure with inorganic fertilizers) increased soil microbial biomass and activity, increased soil organic carbon and nutrient levels, improved dry-soil crack reduction relative to inorganic-only or no fertilizer, and increased maize yield in trials; manure alone also increased microbial biomass and organic carbon (ID 902). Green manures increased soil organic carbon and raised grain yields in controlled, randomized, replicated studies (ID 908). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure in one study, reduced soil loss in one study with mixed erosion results elsewhere, increased soil nitrogen and sometimes reduced nitrate leaching when straw was incorporated, increased soil organic carbon and aggregation across multiple studies, and increased yields in individual trials (ID 910). Incorporating allelopathic plant residues sometimes reduced weeds but effects varied by timing, species and residue type; weed suppression often lasted only days to weeks; crop growth could be inhibited depending on timing; and yield responses ranged from positive to negative or mixed across studies (ID 728).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Mowing increased the number of heathland plants in one of two sites and increased the presence of a small minority of heathland plants, but the presence of non\u2011heathland plants did not change [1638].
