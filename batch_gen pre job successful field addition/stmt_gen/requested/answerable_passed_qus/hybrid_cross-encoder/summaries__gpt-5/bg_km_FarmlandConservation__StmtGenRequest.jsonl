Additional reported benefits include reduced soil loss and runoff in several trials that included European sites (with mixed results overall) (906), higher soil organic carbon under no\u2011till or reduced tillage in studies that included Europe\u2014with one randomized, replicated trial in Spain finding the opposite\u2014and maintained or increased soil organic matter, improved soil structure, and, in some studies, higher nutrient retention (906). Reported drawbacks or limitations include cases of negative, no, or inconsistent effects on some invertebrates (including earthworms), weeds, mammals, and some bird species, with one study noting declining bird preferences for conservation\u2011tillage fields over time and mixed long\u2011term effects on earthworms; weed responses also varied by crop type (126, 211). Soil physical responses were mixed: some replicated trials (including in Europe) found higher compaction under reduced tillage, and trials from Europe and India found greater soil cracking reduction, higher infiltration, and higher soil water content with conventional ploughing and sub\u2011soiling than with reduced tillage; no\u2011till increased soil loss where crop cover was absent (906). Yield responses included a randomized, replicated study from Portugal reporting no effect of tillage treatment on yield (906).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Additional grassland restoration techniques used to build species-rich swards include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing (133). Hydrological management specifically includes raising water levels in ditches or grassland to promote wetland plant assemblages typical of wet grassland (121). Management within wet meadows also includes annual autumn mowing or light grazing with cattle or horses, removal of trees and shrubs encroaching on wet meadows, and in some cases the use of burning as a management method on fen meadows (3971).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To mitigate the impacts of intensive arable farming, what are the effects of taking land out of production, either as set-aside or by converting it to grassland?\nanswer: Set-aside: Across 34 comparative studies, many found higher use or benefits for wildlife on set\u2011aside than cropped fields, including a UK systematic review showing significantly higher farmland bird densities on set\u2011aside in both winter and summer; however, some studies found mixed, no, or adverse effects, and skylark nesting success was higher in two UK studies but lower in one (156). Additional syntheses report that some species occur at higher densities or use set\u2011aside more than other habitats while some occur at lower densities; species richness was often higher on set\u2011aside than crops; waders and skylarks had higher productivity in three of four studies, though one found lower skylark productivity on set\u2011aside; naturally regenerated set\u2011aside tended to hold more birds and species than sown set\u2011aside; evidence on rotational vs non\u2011rotational set\u2011aside was mixed (175). For mammals, set\u2011aside did not increase small mammal or brown hare numbers relative to cropland or other non\u2011crop habitats, though wood mice used uncut set\u2011aside more after harvest (2377). For butterflies and moths, several studies found higher species richness and, in some cases, higher abundance on sown or naturally regenerating set\u2011aside versus cereal fields\u2014especially with less competitive grasses\u2014though other studies found similar richness or abundance to arable, pasture, or uncultivated habitats (3980). Conversion/reversion of arable to permanent grassland: Syntheses of multiple replicated studies found no clear benefits to birds, with one controlled before\u2011and\u2011after UK study reporting significant declines in grey partridge after reversion (561; 210). For butterflies and moths, 10 studies show restored grasslands can develop communities increasingly similar to high\u2011quality grasslands over the first decade; species richness was often higher than on conventional grassland or cultivated farms; abundance was sometimes higher than on conventional grassland or crop fields, though not always increasing with time since restoration; sowing with diverse mixes or with forbs/perennial mixes often increased richness or abundance compared with grass\u2011only mixes; some taxa increased while others decreased following schemes including grassland reversion (3929).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence base for the effectiveness of providing artificial nest sites, such as boxes for birds and bees, on European farmland?\nanswer: For solitary bees, 30 replicated trials across multiple regions (including Europe) found nest boxes were occupied in 29 trials, with many species using them; a study on farmland in Germany recorded endangered species nesting, and German experiments estimated foraging ranges of 150\u2013600 m, indicating boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources (47). On agricultural land, three trials (India, Germany, USA) showed occupied solitary bee nests could double over three years, while parasitism and mortality in boxes were documented across 11 trials with variable rates (47). There is no direct evidence on the effects of introducing pre-stocked solitary-bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds in European agricultural habitats, studies from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK reported occupancy of nest boxes by multiple species (including kestrel, long-eared owl, starling, tits, tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, wryneck and hoopoe), increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows after provision, and relationships of success with habitat (more pasture) and with box height (higher boxes having higher occupancy, eggs and hatched young) (155). For European rollers in Spain, use of nest boxes increased over time and varied by habitat; success did not differ between new and old boxes, though older boxes saw earlier laying (494). For falcons, studies from Europe and elsewhere reported that local populations increased after nest-site installation in some cases, with high or equal-to-natural productivity often recorded, though other studies found lower productivity or non-use, and use and productivity could vary with box design and position (489). For owls, UK and European studies reported apparent local population increases following artificial nest installation and high or equal-to-natural breeding success in several cases, though other controlled studies found lower productivity, species interactions affecting success, or lower juvenile survival from artificial nests; use was at least as frequent as natural sites in some studies and varied with design and position in others (490).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the overall effects of broad-scale agri-environment schemes on farmland biodiversity in Europe?\nanswer: Across Europe, studies report mixed but often positive effects of agri-environment schemes (AES) on farmland biodiversity: for birds, most studies found increases in population size, density or more favourable trends on AES sites, though some studies found negative or no effects, and outcomes could vary with management tier or placement (Action 700). For plants, several studies found AES maintained or had little/no effect on richness or diversity, some found increases, and some found decreases; Environmentally Sensitive Areas in England helped halt loss of semi-natural grasslands but were less effective at enhancing/restoring biodiversity, and flower abundance increased in some Estonian areas (Action 700). For invertebrates, results were mixed: some studies found maintenance or little/no effect and others found increases; bee responses were local rather than landscape-scale in a UK study (Action 700), with additional bee-focused trials across Europe showing both enhanced diversity/abundance under AES and cases with no enhancement, and two UK landscape-scale trials finding no enhancement of bumblebee populations (Action 24). For mammals, UK evidence showed one positive study and three with mixed effects depending on region or species (Action 700). For bats, UK studies reported no significant differences between AES and conventional farms in most cases, with some instances of lower activity on AES farms (Action 962). For amphibians, European evidence includes creation of breeding habitat or increased frog/toad populations in Denmark and Sweden, and higher amphibian species numbers and abundance in Dutch ditches under AES than in conventional management (Action 818). Baseline comparisons noted that some wildlife numbers were higher before AES implementation in certain studies, while two baseline datasets found no overall differences in birds or soil biota between AES and non-AES areas (Action 700).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Providing supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates in several studies, and increased overwinter survival in a declining house sparrow population, though other studies reported no clear effects on breeding abundance, survival in stable house sparrow populations, or other metrics, with one study finding lower fledging rates in one year; use of supplementary food varied by species, season, and proximity to other food sources [648].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the extent of the evidence for the effectiveness of managing or planting new hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland?\nanswer: For managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife, ten studies from Switzerland and the UK reported increases in berry yields, plant and invertebrate diversity/richness, and farmland bird diversity/abundance; five UK studies found no effects on plant richness, bumblebee queen numbers, or farmland birds; two replicated studies reported mixed or adverse effects, including reduced hawthorn berry yield; one replicated site comparison found hedges cut every two years provided more suitable nesting habitat for grey partridge, while removing fruit-bearing wood reduced hawthorn berry yield [116]. For mammals specifically, no studies were found evaluating the effects of managing hedgerows on farmland [2382]. For butterflies and moths under hedgerow management, 17 studies (mostly UK) showed that more structurally complex or tree-containing hedgerows and certain cutting regimes were associated with higher species richness/diversity and, in multiple cases, higher abundance of butterflies, moths, caterpillars, pupae, and brown hairstreak eggs, though several studies found similar richness or abundance under agri-environment or conventional management and some reported lower caterpillar abundance in managed versus remnant hedgerows [3975]. For planting new hedges, seven studies (UK, Ireland, Canada) on butterflies and moths found that established hedgerows often had higher species richness and abundance than beetle banks, crops, pasture, grass margins or field interiors, with one study reporting similar richness to grass banks and one behavior study showing moths tended to fly parallel to hedgerows [3976]. For bats, two UK studies on hedgerow management found more bat species and higher activity for some species along hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior compared to those trimmed the previous winter, while pipistrelle activity did not differ between hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment scheme farms and conventional farms; no studies were found on planting new hedges for bats [1943, 1942]. For mammals under planting or maintaining hedgerows, three studies (UK, Switzerland) reported that retaining/enhancing hedgerows with other boundary features was associated with higher brown hare density in arable but not grassland sites, Irish hare numbers did not increase, and establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance [2383].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do farm-level agri-environment scheme options scale up to benefit biodiversity at the landscape level?\nanswer: Across Europe, many studies report higher densities, population sizes or more favorable trends of some birds on agri-environment scheme (AES) sites than on non-AES sites, though other studies found mixed or no effects; higher-tier management sometimes had higher bird numbers and siting of agreements influenced effectiveness [700, 172]. For bees, one UK study reported AES prescriptions had local but not landscape-scale effects on bee numbers, and two UK landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland with AES compared to without [700, 24]. For butterflies and moths, farms managed under AES (including options such as uncropped cultivated margins and wild bird seed plots) sometimes had higher abundance of butterflies and micro-moths than conventionally managed farms, yet comparisons of farms with larger versus smaller areas of in-field AES options often showed similar butterfly richness or abundance; wider field margins increased butterfly richness or abundance in some years [3923, 3930, 3926]. For bats, replicated paired-site studies in the UK found overall bat activity or occurrence often did not differ between AES and conventional farms, and in some cases was lower on AES farms; hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for some species than hedges trimmed the previous winter [962, 1943]. In wetland-focused options, raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers (including breeding birds), plant species favoring wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass, with a UK review indicating that more expensive options like water-level control were more effective for providing habitat for wading birds than easier options [121]. Overall, evidence indicates that while several farm-level AES options can produce local gains, landscape-scale responses vary by taxon and implementation extent or placement [700, 24, 3923, 3926, 3930, 962, 1943, 121, 172].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A systematic review reported that trapping reduces American mink populations, but firm conclusions were limited by experimental design; a large-scale UK trapping programme eradicated mink over a large area and this may have been associated with localized water vole expansions (107). For broader predator control that includes mammalian predators (e.g., foxes, stoats, weasels) alongside birds, UK and French studies reported increased abundance or population size of some birds and some evidence of increased productivity, nest or reproductive success or survival; a global systematic review found reproductive success of birds increased with predator removal (699).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands: Across studies including three in the UK, several comparisons found higher species richness or abundance of butterflies and moths on less intensively managed grasslands than on conventionally managed sites; specifically in the UK, a before-and-after study reported that after reducing grazing and stopping chemical applications, large moth species richness and total abundance increased, with increases in five of 23 butterfly species and decreases in two species [3958]. Broader multi-taxa evidence (including UK studies) reported that reduced management intensity benefited invertebrates in many studies, but other studies found mixed or no effects, and some found more invertebrates under intensive management; invertebrate communities on less intensively managed grasslands were distinct from those on intensively managed grasslands [69].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In the Netherlands, what are the most effective management strategies for increasing wading bird populations on wet grasslands?\nanswer: Evidence from the Netherlands indicates that maintaining traditional water meadows can increase populations or territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black\u2011tailed godwit, though impacts on other species can vary; a replicated site comparison also found more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots with wader\u2011focused management combined with per\u2011clutch payments, while field\u2011scale abundance and richness did not differ from conventional fields (ID: 696). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers in agricultural landscapes, and a Netherlands randomized, controlled study found water\u2011level raising accelerated establishment of vegetation typical of wet grassland, although one Netherlands study reported no effect on lapwing foraging rate and some studies found net plant species losses (ID: 121). Delaying mowing or first grazing dates increased breeding wading bird densities in studies that included the Netherlands, alongside other taxa benefits (ID: 131). Direct per\u2011clutch payments on Dutch farms showed limited evidence for population increases (no population effect in one study; slightly higher breeding densities but not higher overall numbers in another), yet were associated with higher hatching success of lapwing and black\u2011tailed godwit; combined with postponed agricultural activities, more birds bred on 12.5 ha plots compared to controls (ID: 146).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and limitations of creating uncropped plots in arable fields for wildlife?\nanswer: Documented benefits include increases in plant species richness and establishment of rare arable plants, higher abundance or richness of bumblebees, spiders, ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, and positive responses in some farmland birds such as increased stone-curlew breeding population size, higher northern lapwing hatching success, improved Eurasian skylark nesting success, and breeding use of lapwing plots by lapwing, skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail [562]. For butterflies and moths, farms or fields with uncropped cultivated margins/plots sometimes had higher abundance of butterflies and micro\u2011moths or higher abundance of some butterfly species, though species richness and abundance were often similar to conventional farms or varied among species and years [3923]. Skylark plots (undrilled patches) showed positive effects on skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and use of undrilled patches; additional benefits to plants and some invertebrates were reported [540]. Documented limitations include findings of no effect on many bird species or ground beetles in some studies, fewer seed\u2011eating birds on fallow plots for ground\u2011nesting birds in two of three regions, greater occurrence of pernicious weeds on uncropped cultivated margins than on conservation or conventional headlands, and a lower proportion of young grey partridges in populations where these margins/plots were common [562].
