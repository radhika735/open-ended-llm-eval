[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different management approaches for uncropped arable field margins in Europe, such as sowing mixes versus natural regeneration, compare in their benefits for bumblebees?\nanswer: Across multiple replicated European/UK trials, sown margins generally supported more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated margins. Field margins sown with agricultural nectar/pollen mixes\u2014especially with perennial leguminous flowering plants\u2014attracted significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped margins (four replicated trials), though value declined over time and margins required re-sowing every few years (three UK trials) [18]. Margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes and subsequently mown supported higher bumblebee abundance (and in three trials higher species richness) than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (five UK trials; naturally regenerated outperformed wildflower in none; one small trial found similar species richness between wildflower-sown and naturally regenerated strips) [19]. For agricultural forage mixes versus perennial wildflower mixes, mixes including legumes (all annuals in one trial) attracted greater bumblebee numbers at least in the first year, while one small replicated trial found common long\u2011tongued species preferred perennial wildflower plots over annual forage mixes [18, 19]. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins sometimes equaled wildflower-sown margins in bee species richness in a small unreplicated trial, but other replicated work found neither higher abundance nor diversity than cropped margins; their value often depended on thistles requiring control and varied between years [20].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented outcomes and challenges of rearing bumblebees in captivity for reintroduction?\nanswer: Captive-rearing trials document mixed outcomes across species: some declining North American species (e.g., Bombus vagans, B. terricola, B. rufocinctus) were induced to rear adults in captivity, but other species (e.g., B. fervidus, B. affinis, B. pensylvanicus) laid eggs whose larvae died before adulthood; B. ruderatus and the Neotropical B. atratus have also been reared in laboratories [50]. In longer-term artificial rearing, B. terrestris queens decreased in weight over four years [50]. Husbandry factors influenced success: fresher, higher\u2011protein pollen improved reproductive output and queen quality; an 8L:16D light regime reduced time to first egg laying; hibernation at 4\u20135\u00b0C for ~45 days enhanced egg\u2011laying and colony formation but yielded smaller colonies than non\u2011hibernated queens; survival after hibernation was better for queens >0.6 g and with \u22644 months hibernation [50]. Field reintroductions of lab\u2011reared colonies showed variable queen production: some trials produced few or no new queens, while others produced good numbers [52]. Social parasitism by cuckoo bumblebees was sometimes high (25\u201366% and 79%), and was reduced when colonies were placed in intermediate\u2011resource landscapes and later in the season; other trials reported no parasitism [52]. Supplementary feeding in the field improved reproductive success in one trial but not productivity in another and did not reduce parasite load; released B. terrestris colonies foraged mostly >100 m from nests [52]. Overall, outcomes ranged from successful rearing and reproduction to larval mortality and reduced queen condition, with key challenges including diet quality, rearing regime, hibernation parameters, variable field productivity, and parasitism risk [50, 52].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Placement relative to forage is important: nest sites should be within about 150\u2013600 m of floral resources [47][80]. Nest design and materials influence productivity: reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs produced more bees per nest than several alternatives, whereas plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould; for Centris analis, cardboard straws in drilled wooden holes were more productive than grooved boards [47][80]. Repeated provision over multiple years increased use, with occupied nests approximately doubling over three years at given sites, and increases in foraging Osmia or local emergence where boxes were provided [47][80]. Parasites and predators reduce productivity, with measured brood losses from parasitism and other mortality in multiple studies; introduced earwigs and non-native bees sometimes occupied boxes [47]. Excluding ants from nest sites increased offspring production in a replicated controlled trial [46]. Under management, populations nesting in drilled blocks or stacked boards can increase markedly when conditions are good and plentiful floral resources are provided, indicating resource availability strongly affects productivity [54].

Wooden surface/above-ground boxes are not the most effective design and have had low recent occupancy compared to underground or aerial designs (48). There is no evidence for effects of providing bumblebee nest boxes on bumblebee populations (48).\n- Solitary bee nest boxes can experience high rates of parasitism and mortality: examples include 56% overall brood mortality for Xylocopa fenestrata in India (36% parasitism, 20% other mortality), 13% mortality (with 2% parasitized) in Germany, and 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao in Indonesia (47). Certain materials perform poorly: plastic-lined holes and plastic or paper tubes were less productive due to parasitism or mould (47).\n- Non-target and introduced species, including European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bees, frequently occupy solitary bee boxes; in one trial, introduced species used boxes more commonly than native bees (47). Earwig presence in boxes reduced use by native bees, necessitating exclusion measures (44).\n- Some nest box deployments fail to attract target bees: one trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using solitary bee boxes, soil-filled boxes for Andrena flavipes were not occupied, and a trial with stingless bee boxes in Brazil found no uptake (47; 49). Reported solitary bee occupancy can also be low, with 1\u201326% of available cavities used in some studies (80).\n- Placement and design constraints limit effectiveness: solitary bee boxes need to be within approximately 150\u2013600 m of forage resources, and material choice (e.g., reed stems or certain wooden designs) affects productivity (80; 47).\n- Introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees has no evidence of effects on farmland wildlife, representing an evidence gap (81).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects on wild bees of introducing agri-environment schemes on European farmland?\nanswer: Across Europe, replicated trials reported mixed effects of agri-environment schemes on wild bees: four trials documented enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on scheme-managed land, including under Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, a German organic arable option, Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements (with very low bee species numbers), and the Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme (including nest-searching queen bumblebees) [24]. Four other replicated trials found no enhancement of bee numbers or species under schemes, including Dutch meadow bird agreements in wet grassland, Spanish measures around a National Park and for steppe-living birds, and 6 m grass margin strips in England [24]. At wider landscape scales in the UK, two replicated trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland with schemes\u2014one comparing Bombus terrestris colony reproductive success and another comparing spring queen numbers on farms with and without schemes [24]. Syntheses of invertebrate responses under European schemes reported variable outcomes: studies showed schemes maintained or had little/no effect on some invertebrates including bee colony growth, while others found increases in invertebrate abundance or richness; one UK study recorded local but not landscape-scale increases in bee numbers under scheme prescriptions [700].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In replicated UK trials, margins sown with native wildflower mixes and subsequently mown supported higher bumblebee abundance\u2014and in three trials higher species richness\u2014than cropped, grassy, or naturally regenerated margins; inclusion of perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower mixes was identified as important forage, and one small replicated trial found common long\u2011tongued bumblebees preferred perennial wildflower plots over an annual forage-plant mix (19).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?\nanswer: Across replicated trials, success of captive-rearing and reintroduction was influenced by multiple factors: Social parasitism by cuckoo bees was sometimes high (25\u201366% in Canada; 79% in a UK trial), and was reduced when colonies were placed in landscapes with intermediate nectar/pollen availability and released later in the season [52]. Supplementary feeding had mixed effects: it improved reproductive success in one Canadian trial but did not reduce parasite load, and a USA trial found no increase in colony productivity with feeding [52]. Diet quality during captive rearing affected reproduction: freshly frozen pollen yielded larger, better-surviving queens and larger subsequent colonies than dried, frozen pollen, and higher-protein pollen increased worker offspring production [50]. Husbandry conditions also mattered: an 8h light/16h dark regime reduced time to egg-laying by B. terrestris queens compared to constant darkness [50]. Hibernation regimes affected outcomes: hibernating queens at 4\u20135\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation but produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens; queens >0.6 g and hibernated \u22644 months had higher survival [50]. Field outcomes of releases varied, with some trials producing few or no new queens and others producing good numbers [52].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
