[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different methods for restricting public access to bat hibernation sites, such as gates versus fences, compare in their effects on bat populations?\nanswer: Across studies, installing cave gates showed mixed effects on bat populations: three of four before-and-after studies reported more or similar numbers of bats after gating while one reported fewer, and a replicated before-and-after study found population increases or slower declines for 13 of 20 Indiana bat colonies; a replicated site comparison found no difference in growth rates between gated and ungated caves, and one study found bats in a gated cave lost more body mass than bats in an unmodified cave [999]. Gate design influenced behavior: bats circled more and entered less after gating in one study; funnel designs were used more than round bar or angle iron designs; reducing bar spacing reduced passes; and significantly fewer bats emerged from a gated cave compared to a fenced cave in a paired comparison [999]. For fencing, evidence was limited but indicated no difference in population growth rates or occupancy between fenced/gated and unfenced caves in a replicated site comparison, and replacing a steel gate with a fence led to significantly more emerging southeastern myotis and gray myotis bats [1991]. Overall, studies directly comparing structures reported reduced emergence with gates relative to fences, while broader comparisons showed neutral to positive abundance responses with well-designed gates and neutral population metrics with fencing [999, 1991].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating artificial water sources has been studied in five countries (USA, Germany, South Africa, Israel, Mexico): replicated studies reported bat activity (relative abundance) was similar or higher over reservoirs, wastewater treatment pools, heliponds, drainage ditches, retention ponds, and farm/cattle ponds than over natural wetlands, nearby vineyards, surrounding forest, or grassland/crops; species richness over farm ponds was similar to other nearby habitats (959). Managing livestock water troughs affected bat use and drinking success: removing livestock modifications increased drinking frequency and reduced the number of approaches before successful drinking; larger, full tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking than smaller, half-full tanks with no or dense vegetation (1951). Creating or maintaining small dams: a replicated site comparison in Portugal found reservoirs created by small dams had greater activity of four bat species than the streams feeding them (1997). Wetland restoration: a replicated, controlled, before\u2013after study in the USA found restoring wetlands increased overall bat activity, and restored wetlands had similar activity to undisturbed wetlands (2036). Managing ditches to benefit bats: no studies found (1944).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

No studies were found that evaluated breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations affected by white\u2011nose syndrome [2009], and no studies were found that evaluated the effects of releasing captive\u2011bred bats on bat populations [2039]. Four studies evaluated rehabilitating injured/orphaned bats: 70\u201390% of hand\u2011reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4\u201314 days after release, with six of 21 joining wild colonies [2054]; pipistrelles that flew in a large flight cage for longer periods before release survived longer and were more active than those with shorter or small\u2011enclosure flight [2054]; 13% of ringed hand\u2011reared pipistrelles were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release [2054]; two orphaned greater spear\u2011nosed bats survived over three months in captivity and increased in body weight and size to normal within 60 days [2054].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
