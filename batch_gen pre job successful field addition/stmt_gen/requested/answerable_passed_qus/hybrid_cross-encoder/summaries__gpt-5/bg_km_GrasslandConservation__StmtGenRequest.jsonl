Adding charcoal to soil before sowing seeds did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover, but increased the cover of legumes while not altering the cover of other forbs in a replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the Netherlands [3422]. Adding sulphur to soil before sowing seeds reduced plant species richness in one study and did not change overall richness in another, did not alter the number or cover of native plant species, reduced overall vegetation cover, and increased the cover of three of six sown species when applied at low amounts, in replicated controlled studies in the UK and USA [3428]. Adding sulphur alongside sowing did not increase heather cover in a majority of cases, and adding sulphur with heathland clippings had mixed effects on cover of common heather, perennial rye-grass, and common bent; adding sulphur alongside planting of heather seedlings increased their survival, though survival was very low after two years, in replicated and controlled UK studies [1710].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
