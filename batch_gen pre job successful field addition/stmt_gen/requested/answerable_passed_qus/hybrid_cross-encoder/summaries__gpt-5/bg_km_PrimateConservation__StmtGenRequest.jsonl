In captive-focused feeding strategies, providing cut branches (browse) led captive gorillas in the Netherlands and Germany to use processing skills seen in wild gorillas [1332], and increasing the number of feeds per day increased time spent feeding in chimpanzees but also increased hair eating in baboons in Japan and the USA [1337].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Reported potential benefits from cases where problem primates were removed and relocated, alongside other interventions, include survival at or near non-residential release sites for at least four years for translocated rhesus monkeys (India) and western lowland gorillas (Republic of Congo and Gabon), and long-term survival for crop-raiding olive baboons comparable to non-translocated populations after 16 years (Kenya) (1422). Potential drawbacks, drawn from broader mammal translocations in residential-conflict contexts, include lower survival after translocation compared to non-translocated animals in several species (e.g., grizzly bears and some deer; most translocated Amur tigers not surviving one year) and individuals returning to capture locations and/or continuing nuisance behavior, sometimes repeatedly (bears), with one case of increased attacks on humans and livestock after leopard translocation; though one study found translocated brown bears occurred less often inside high-conflict areas than non-translocated bears (2336).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the comparative outcomes of providing primates with continuous supplementary food versus providing it only during scarce periods or for a limited time?\nanswer: Continuous supplementary feeding: Two studies reported population increases following regular provision alongside other interventions (China; The Gambia), while two studies reported population declines under similar circumstances (Thailand; Malaysia). Three studies reported that the majority of primates survived with regular supplementary feeding (Brazil; South Africa; Indonesia). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (Liberia). One controlled study found introduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed different diets from a resident wild group after a year of regular supplementation (Madagascar) [1526]. Scarce-period-only feeding: One before-and-after study reported the majority of chimpanzees survived for at least five years (Republic of Congo). One before-and-after study reported wild olive baboons survived for at least 17 years after drought-period feeding soon after translocation (Kenya). One controlled study reported that black-and-white ruffed lemur diets were similar to wild individuals after scarce-period feeding (Madagascar) [1527]. Limited-time feeding: One study reported a chimpanzee population increase after two months of post-reintroduction feeding (Tanzania). One before-and-after study reported a golden lion tamarin population declined after one year following supplementary feeding (Brazil). One study reported an abandoned infant muriqui was retrieved by its mother and rejoined the wild group after feeding (Brazil). Four studies reported that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived (Brazil; Madagascar; South Africa). One study reported the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least 27 months (Guinea). Three studies reported a majority of primates survived reintroduction while being supplementary fed (Gabon; South Africa; Vietnam). Two studies reported the majority of lowland gorillas survived for at least nine months to four years (Gabon; Republic of Congo) [1528].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
