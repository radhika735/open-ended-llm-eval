Two of three controlled studies, conducted in the North Sea and the Bay of Fundy, indicated that nets made from materials like iron-oxide or barium sulfate led to fewer harbour porpoise entanglements compared to conventional nets (2807). However, another study found that nets made of barium sulfate did not decrease dolphin entanglements (2807). Behavioural studies have produced mixed findings; one study noted that harbour porpoises used fewer echolocation clicks near barium sulfate nets, while another found no difference in echolocation activity compared to conventional nets (2807).\n\nIn contrast, two studies have evaluated the effect of attaching acoustically reflective objects to fishing gear (2806). One controlled study in the Timor Sea and Arafura Sea reported that adding metallic bead chains to nets did not reduce dolphin entanglements (2806). Another study in the Gulf of Alaska found that attaching acrylic beads to fishing gear did not deter sperm whales from preying on fish catches (2806).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study found that common bottlenose dolphins were more likely to avoid a boat when acoustic devices were active (2815). Another study observed that killer whales maintained a greater distance from a fishing vessel when a device was in use, though this effect diminished with repeated exposure (2815). For Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins, the use of these devices led to a reduction in surfacing, echolocation rates, and time spent foraging or socializing (2815). Furthermore, acoustic devices on moorings have been found to decrease the activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins, and common bottlenose dolphins, as well as reduce the numbers of grey and harbour seals in the immediate vicinity (2816). Studies also specifically noted a reduction in harbour porpoise echolocation activity (2816) and a general decrease in the activity of common bottlenose dolphins in the presence of these devices (2816).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Additionally, some studies on marine mammals found that using devices like net sleeves or cage and chain devices on fishing hooks reduced damage to catches by whales (2821). One of these studies also found fewer unwanted catches of toothed whales (2821). However, other devices like \u2018umbrella\u2019 or \u2018spider\u2019 devices did not show a reduction in predation (2821), and streamer devices were only effective for a short period against dolphins (2821). No studies were found on the effects of these devices on reptile populations (3582).\n\nIn comparison, modifying fishing pots has shown varied outcomes. Two studies found that floating or semi-floating traps caught fewer unwanted invertebrates and fewer unwanted species compared to bottom traps, without affecting the commercial catch (2144). However, modifying the design of traps had inconsistent effects on the amount of unwanted catch, which varied by trap design and area (2143).

Studies have indicated that these devices can lead to fewer encounters and interactions with nets for harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, and other marine mammals, with reduced activity and sightings in the surrounding areas (2808). Additionally, the use of acoustic devices has been found to decrease damage to fish catches and fishing nets caused by seals and common bottlenose dolphins (2808). Some studies have also observed reduced activity of harbour porpoises around moorings equipped with these devices (2816).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of acoustic devices is not universally consistent. Some studies found no significant impact on the behaviour of certain dolphin and porpoise species (2808). The success of these devices in preventing entanglement can also vary between different species and geographic locations (2808). For instance, one study found a reduction in harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not in another (2808). Another study noted that while a 'complete' set of acoustic devices reduced entanglements, an 'incomplete' set did not (2808). Furthermore, there is a potential for habituation; one study on moorings indicated that the likelihood of harbour porpoises approaching a device increased over a period of 10\u201311 days (2816).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Nine studies also found that using acoustic devices on fishing nets or traps resulted in fewer entanglements or collisions of various marine mammals, including whales, porpoises, and dolphins. However, three other studies found that the devices led to fewer entanglements for some species but not others, and one study found a reduction in one fishing area but not another (2808). In terms of behavior, twelve of sixteen studies found that acoustic devices on nets caused porpoises, dolphins, and seals to avoid the gear, while four studies found no significant effect (2808).\n\nRegarding vessels, one controlled study found that common bottlenose dolphins avoided a boat more frequently when acoustic devices were deployed. Another found that killer whales were recorded further from a fishing vessel using an acoustic device, but this effect diminished over time. However, a randomized, controlled study in the North Atlantic found that using two types of acoustic devices did not reduce predation of squid catches by Risso\u2019s dolphins (2815).\n\nFor moorings, one randomized controlled study in the Puntledge River found that deploying an acoustic device on a mooring reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon (2816). Other studies found mixed results on behavior, with some showing reduced activity of seals, porpoises and dolphins, while others found no effect on humpback whales.

However, one study found that while short-finned whales initially moved away, they remained within 900m of the vessel, and another found that humpback whales slowed their speed but did not significantly alter their course (2897). Another method is the use of acoustic devices to deter mammals. Studies have shown that these devices reduced the activity and sightings of harbour porpoises at distances of 1\u201318 km from wind farm construction sites (2896). In another study, minke whales were observed to swim away from the acoustic device, increase their swimming speed, and swim more directly (2896). There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of modifying vessels to reduce noise disturbance on marine and freshwater mammal populations (2904).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One of these studies, a before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean, discovered that implementing vessel speed limits during particular times in important habitats led to a decrease in the number of deaths of North Atlantic right whales resulting from collisions [2777]. A separate before-and-after study conducted in the Indian River estuarine system revealed similar numbers of manatee fatalities before and after the implementation of vessel speed limits in 'zones'. However, a reduction in deaths was observed after speed limits were established and enforced throughout all areas [2777]. No studies were found that assessed the effects of diverting shipping routes [2754] or modifying vessels to minimize the risk of physical harm to mammals [2762].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Another study in the South Pacific Ocean found that the survival rate of Hector\u2019s dolphins was higher after a coastal area was legally protected (2915). Conversely, a study in the North Sea found that a bottlenose dolphin population was of a similar size before and after their range was protected (2915). Additionally, a study in an Australian estuary reported a similar number of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin strandings after legal protection, though the number of human-caused strandings decreased (2915). \n\nNo studies were found that evaluated the effects of legally protecting marine and freshwater mammal species (2923) or of establishing a network of legally protected areas for these species (2913).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and negative outcomes associated with captive rearing and rehabilitation of marine mammals?\nanswer: Of twelve studies on hand-rearing orphaned or abandoned marine and freshwater mammals, one study found that most captive-reared Antillean manatees released into the wild reproduced (2926). Several studies found that released animals survived post-release, with one study showing survival rates for captive-reared Pacific harbour seal pups were similar to wild pups (2926). In contrast, other studies reported that some captive-reared animals died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity, or only survived with supplemental feeding (2926). Some animals died while still in captivity (2926). In a study on releasing captive-bred animals, a low number of Antillean and Florida manatees survived for at least a year in the wild (2933). For breeding in captivity, studies have shown successful births and survival of young for Indo-Pacific dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins (2932). However, most captive-born Amazon river dolphins, narrow-ridged finless porpoises, and Irrawaddy dolphins did not survive in captivity (2932). Furthermore, a study on a semi-captive population of Yangtze finless porpoises found low genetic diversity (2932). In terms of behavior, two controlled studies found that captive-reared and released seal and sea lion pups had similar diving behavior to wild pups, while another found captive-reared seal pups traveled greater distances from the release site than wild pups (2926).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
