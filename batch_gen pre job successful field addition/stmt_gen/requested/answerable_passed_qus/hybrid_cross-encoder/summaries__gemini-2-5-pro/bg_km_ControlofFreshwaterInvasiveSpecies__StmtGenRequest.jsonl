For parrot's feather, the herbicide triclopyr has been shown to reduce growth in laboratory studies and cover in field studies, although cover later increased to near pre-treatment levels in one study (1689). In a laboratory setting, triclopyr was more effective at reducing cover than glyphosate (1689). Other herbicides, such as dichlobenil, imazamox, imazapyr, flumioxazin, and florpyrauxifen-benzyl, have been found to reduce the growth of parrot's feather in laboratory studies (1699). In field studies, glyphosate and gluphosinate-ammonium reduced parrot's feather biomass (1699). However, fluridone, clopyralid, and copper chelate did not reduce growth in laboratory studies (1699). For water primrose, a combination of glyphosate, a surface active agent, and subsequent mechanical removal resulted in a 75% kill rate (1140).
