The usage of these structures by five bat species was found to be influenced by the underpass type and height, the width of the road, and the amount of forest and hedgerows in the surrounding landscape (976). One study in Australia also found that bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than species adapted to open or edge habitats (976).\n\nFour studies in Europe and Australia have evaluated the installation of overpasses as road crossing structures for bats (977). One study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass was not used (977). Two other studies found that some bat species used overpasses, but up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road at traffic height or at other nearby locations (977).

For fences, one replicated study found no difference in the population growth rates of bats roosting in caves with and without fencing or gates installed (1991). One study found that installing cave gates resulted in population increases or decreased rates of decline for 13 of 20 colonies of Indiana bat (999).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats?\nanswer: Several factors related to bat box design and placement have been shown to influence their use by bats.\n\nIn terms of design, black bat boxes were found to be used more than grey, white, or wooden ones (1024). One study indicated that larger bat boxes had higher occupancy rates (1024). The material of the box also matters, with one study finding that resin boxes were occupied more quickly than wooden ones, and another showing higher occupancy in concrete boxes compared to wood (1024). Specific designs like rocket boxes, two-compartment boxes, and those mimicking tree trunks have proven effective, and different bat species may prefer different designs (1024).\n\nPlacement is also critical. The orientation of the box and its exposure to sunlight can affect occupancy (1024). While the effect of height is debated, with some studies showing it matters and others finding no effect, boxes on buildings were found to have higher occupancy than those on trees (1024). The surrounding habitat is a factor, with higher occupancy observed in farm forestry over native forest and in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands (1024). Additionally, higher success rates are seen when boxes are installed in areas where bats were already known to roost, and installing a greater number of boxes across a site increases the likelihood of occupation (1024).\n\nHowever, when creating alternative roosts as part of a development, bat boxes or bat lofts that were built to replace destroyed roosts were four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that were retained during development (949). Two other studies found that bats did not use any of the alternative roosts provided in bat houses or a purpose-built bat wall after being excluded from buildings (949).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different types of purpose-built road crossing structures compare in effectiveness for bats?\nanswer: Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of different road crossing structures for bats, including bat gantries, overpasses, and underpasses (976, 977, 978).\n\nStudies on bat gantries in the UK and France have shown that fewer bats used these structures compared to crossing the road at traffic height (978). In one instance, a bat gantry was not used at all, and in another case, a temporary gantry was used by three bat species or species groups, but almost half of the bats crossed the road at other locations (978).\n\nThe effectiveness of overpasses has been found to vary. In Australia, one study recorded the same number of bat species at an overpass as in the surrounding forest and bushland (977). However, studies in Ireland and France indicated that up to 75% of bats crossed the road at traffic level or other locations, despite the presence of overpasses (977). The design of the overpass appears to be a key factor, as a UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, whereas an unvegetated overpass was completely unused (977).\n\nUnderpasses and culverts are also used by bats for crossing roads, although the proportion of use varies, with some bats still choosing to fly over the road (976). The use of these structures is influenced by their type and height, the width of the road, and the composition of the surrounding landscape, such as the presence of forests and hedgerows (976). Furthermore, bat species adapted to cluttered habitats were observed to use smaller underpasses and culverts more frequently than species adapted to open or edge habitats (976).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly.

One study in South Africa found a similar number of bat species over farm ponds compared to other habitats (959). Five studies in Israel, the USA, Germany, South Africa, and Mexico found that bat activity was similar or higher over various artificial water sources, such as reservoirs, wastewater treatment pools, and farm ponds, compared to natural wetlands or surrounding terrestrial habitats (959). Two studies in the USA evaluated managing livestock water troughs. One study found that removing livestock modifications from water troughs led to bats drinking from them more frequently and approaching them fewer times before drinking successfully (1951). The same study noted that larger, full water tanks with sparse surrounding vegetation had more bats drinking from them (1951). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of managing natural water bodies in arid areas to prevent desiccation on bat populations (2027).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two studies found more bat species on organic farms, while five of seven studies found no difference in the number of bat species between organic and non-organic farms (961).

Two of three studies found that bat activity or the occurrence of six bat species did not differ between farms managed under agri-environment schemes and those managed conventionally. One study found lower overall bat activity on agri-environment scheme farms than conventional farms (962).

Six of these studies found that between 6% and 100% of female bats captured in the wild successfully conceived, gave birth, and reared young in captivity (2053). Two studies found that some bats born in captivity also successfully gave birth to live young (2053). Seven studies found that between 20% and 100% of bat pups born in captivity survived from 10 days to adulthood (2053). Four studies evaluated the effects of rehabilitating injured or orphaned bats. Two of these studies found that 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelle bats survived for at least 4-14 days after release, and one study found that 13% of ringed, hand-reared bats were found alive in bat boxes 38 days to almost four years after release (2054). Another study found that two hand-reared orphaned bats survived for over three months in captivity and reached normal size after 60 days (2054).
