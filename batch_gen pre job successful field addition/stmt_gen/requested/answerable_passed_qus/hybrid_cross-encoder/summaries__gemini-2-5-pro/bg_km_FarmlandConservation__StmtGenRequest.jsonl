[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and potential drawbacks of reducing tillage on European farmland?\nanswer: The documented benefits of reducing tillage on European farmland include positive effects on earthworms, such as increased biomass, species richness, and abundance (126). It can lead to a greater abundance of some invertebrates (126), an increase in certain weed species (126), and more invertebrate bird food resources in no-till systems (126). For birds, benefits can include higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances (126). Some studies also found a greater abundance of birds like the Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds, and gamebirds in late winter (126), as well as higher species richness or diversity for some bird groups in certain areas (211). Additionally, some bird species may be found at higher densities (211), and there is evidence for higher productivity, nesting success, or earlier laying on reduced tillage fields (211).\n\nPotential drawbacks or inconclusive findings show that reducing tillage can have negative, no, or inconsistent effects on the abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates and earthworms (126). It may also negatively affect or have no consistent impact on the number of different plant species, some weed species, and mammal abundance (126). In one study, bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time (126), and another found that crop type influenced the number of weeds under different tillage regimes (126). Some studies found that measures of bird diversity were lower or no different on reduced-tillage fields (211), and that some or all bird species were found at similar or lower densities (211).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study found that techniques for restoring wet meadow plant communities included topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing. It was also found that a combination of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species, plus livestock exclusion, was a successful management technique (119). Other effective techniques for restoring species-rich grassland include hay spreading and mowing (133). In addition to grazing, the removal of trees and shrubs from wet meadows, and mowing once/year in autumn have also been noted as successful management techniques (3971). One study from the UK found that wet grassland grazed at an intermediate intensity by cattle had a higher abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillar webs (3971). However, some studies found that efforts to restore species-rich grassland had no clear effect on the species richness or abundance of plants, beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths (133). In terms of the timeline for restoration, some studies have seen positive signs of restoration in less than five years, while others have found that restoration was not complete nine or 20 years later (119, 133).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence base for the effectiveness of providing artificial nest sites, such as boxes for birds and bees, on European farmland?\nanswer: Regarding solitary bees, multiple studies have indicated their readiness to use artificial nest sites. Specifically, research in Germany has shown that with consistent provision, the count of occupied nests can double in a span of three years (47, 80). For these measures to be effective, it is crucial that foraging resources are located within a 150 to 600-meter radius of the nests (47, 80). The design of the nest box is also a factor in its success; reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes have been found to be more productive than options with plastic-lined holes or tubes made of plastic or paper (47). Conversely, the uptake of nest boxes by bumblebees is significantly lower, at a rate of 2% or less (80). There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of introducing pre-stocked solitary bee nest boxes on farmland wildlife (81). For birds, providing nest boxes on agricultural land has been shown to boost the breeding numbers and clutches of species like the Eurasian kestrel and tree sparrow (155). These nest boxes on farmland have been observed to be inhabited by a variety of bird species, including the long-eared owl, common starling, tits, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck, and Eurasian hoopoe (155). The effectiveness of these bird nest boxes can be affected by their height and the availability of nearby pasture (155). Furthermore, a study focusing on European rollers in Spain noted a progressive increase in nest box use over time (494).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, six other studies noted that the changes in plant communities were slow or limited [133]. Even after sixty years, differences in vegetation between restored and existing species-rich grasslands have been recorded [133]. The restoration of species-rich grassland has been shown to lead to a higher abundance of ground beetles, farmland birds, pollinating insects, and earthworms, as well as increased plant species richness when compared to other types of grassland [133]. Restored grasslands have also been found to have similar communities of flower-visiting insects to ancient species-rich grasslands [8]. On the other hand, some studies have found no discernible impact on the species richness or abundance of plants and beetles, or the abundance of butterflies and moths [133]. Additionally, a study on semi-natural grasslands restored through scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing revealed that the butterfly communities were different from those in existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time [3955].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For birds, twenty-four of twenty-six European studies indicated that some or all bird populations or densities increased on sites with agri-environment schemes (700), and twenty-two of twenty-five European studies found that at least some bird species had higher densities or more positive population trends on sites with these schemes (172). However, another fifteen European studies found that some or all bird species showed no increase in density or had similar or lower population levels on such sites (172). Specifically, three UK reviews noted population increases for cirl buntings, corncrakes, and Eurasian thick-knees due to specially-designed schemes, although many other species continued to decline (172).\n\nRegarding plants, seven of eleven European studies revealed that agri-environment schemes either maintained or had little to no effect on plant diversity or species richness (700). Three studies reported an increase in plant species richness in areas with these schemes, while two studies noted a decrease (700). In terms of invertebrates, six of ten European studies demonstrated that agri-environment schemes maintained or had minimal to no effect on the diversity, abundance, or species richness of some invertebrates (700), whereas five studies observed an increase in the abundance or species richness of some invertebrates (700). For wild bees specifically, four replicated European trials showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land under agri-environment schemes (24), while another four replicated European trials found no enhancement in the number of bees or bee species (24). Furthermore, two UK trials indicated that bumblebee populations were not enhanced at a landscape scale on farmland with agri-environment schemes (24).\n\nFor mammals in the UK, one of four studies found positive effects from agri-environment schemes, while three studies reported mixed results for different regions or species (700).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The selection of plant species for the mixture can affect its appeal to birds; for example, mixtures containing kale have been found to be particularly effective (594).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Five of these studies were in the UK, one in Ireland and one in Canada (3976). Three of four site comparison studies found that established hedgerows had a higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than in-field beetle banks, crops or pasture (3976). The other study found that hedgerows had a similar species richness of butterflies to grass banks between fields (3976). Five of six studies found that the abundance of butterflies, moths, macro-moths and gatekeepers was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, in field interiors, or 5\u201310 metres away from hedgerows (3976). The other study found that the abundance of butterflies along hedgerows was similar to grass banks between fields without hedgerows (3976). One site comparison study in the UK found that moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to be flying parallel to it than moths recorded further away (3976).\n\nTen studies from Switzerland and the UK found that managing hedges for wildlife resulted in increased berry yields, species diversity or richness of plants and invertebrates and diversity or abundance of farmland birds (116). Five studies from the UK found that hedge management did not affect plant species richness, numbers of bumblebee queens or farmland birds (116). Two replicated studies have shown mixed or adverse effects, with hedge management having mixed effects on invertebrates or leading to reduced hawthorn berry yield (116). A replicated site comparison in the UK found hedges cut every two years had more suitable nesting habitat for grey partridge than other management regimes (116). A replicated study from the UK found that hawthorn berry yield was reduced when management involved removing fruit-bearing wood (116). We found no studies that evaluated the effects on mammals of managing hedgerows to benefit wildlife on farmland (2382).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do farm-level agri-environment scheme options scale up to benefit biodiversity at the landscape level?\nanswer: A UK study found that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had a local but not a landscape-scale effect on bee numbers (700). A review also found that while the amount of land entering an agri-environment scheme was on target, some options were not utilized at high enough rates to benefit many species (172). Studies in the Netherlands revealed that many agri-environment scheme farms were not located in areas where they would likely be effective (700, 172).\n\nOverall, the effects of these schemes are varied. For birds, twenty-four studies found increases in population size or density on sites with agri-environment schemes, while eleven studies found negative or no effects (700). Specifically designed schemes led to population increases for cirl buntings, corncrakes, and Eurasian thick-knees, although many other species continued to decline (172). For plants, seven studies found that schemes maintained or had little to no effect on plant diversity, while three found increases and two found decreases in species richness (700). For invertebrates, six studies showed that schemes maintained or had little effect, while five studies found increases in abundance or species richness (700). In the case of bats, two out of three UK studies found that overall bat activity did not significantly differ between farms under agri-environment schemes and those managed conventionally (962).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Nine studies from the UK and France have looked into the effects of removing predators on birds (699). Three of these studies discovered that controlling predatory mammals or birds boosted the abundance or population size of some birds (699). One UK study found that while numbers of nationally declining songbirds increased on a site with predator control, there was no overall difference in bird abundance, species richness, or diversity between predator control and no-control sites (699). Five UK studies found some evidence for increased bird productivity, nest or reproductive success, or survival after bird or mammal predator control (699). A global systematic review that included data from European farmland found that bird reproductive success increased as predators were removed (699). One randomised, replicated, controlled study discovered that hen harrier breeding success was unaffected by the removal of hooded crows (699).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For improving invertebrate biodiversity in UK grasslands, what is the comparative evidence between reducing management intensity versus restoring species-rich semi-natural grassland?\nanswer: Six studies found that stopping fertilizer inputs in permanent grassland attracted a higher abundance or species richness of some or all invertebrates studied (694). One review also found a study showing that densities of some invertebrates were higher in unfertilized plots compared with those receiving nitrogen inputs (694). However, another review found no clear effect of reducing fertilizer inputs on the density of soil-dwelling invertebrates, and one UK study found lower invertebrate abundance on plots with reduced fertilizer inputs, though the differences were not significant (694). A review found that raised cutting heights were less damaging to invertebrates (138). In contrast, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of invertebrates, and one replicated controlled study found no difference in invertebrate abundance (138).\n\nWhen it comes to the restoration of species-rich, semi-natural grassland, one replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that these areas had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands and did not become more similar over time (3955). The same study found that the species richness of butterflies on restored grasslands remained similar over time since restoration (3955). Two of five replicated, site comparison studies found that restored semi-natural grasslands had a lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths than unmanaged, abandoned grasslands (3955). Two other studies found that grasslands restored by scrub clearing and grazing or mowing had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths to unmanaged grasslands and continuously managed grasslands (3955).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This can also lead to a more rapid establishment of plant species characteristic of wet grasslands (121). However, one study found that raising water levels did not affect the foraging rate of lapwings (121). The restoration of traditional water meadows has had mixed outcomes; some techniques, such as raising water levels, have been successful in restoring wet meadow plant communities, while other studies have reported limited success (119). Delaying the date of first mowing or grazing has been shown in one study to increase the density of breeding wading birds (131). In contrast, another study in the Netherlands reported that this practice had no clear effect on the population trends of wading bird species (131).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and limitations of creating uncropped plots in arable fields for wildlife?\nanswer: Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins or plots in arable fields has several documented benefits for wildlife. These areas can provide benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, including increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, and spiders, and an increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles (562). Specifically for birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (562). Uncropped margins, whether naturally regenerated or sown with wildflowers, have been shown to support a higher abundance and, in some cases, higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges (19, 20, 562). Sown wildflower margins with perennial leguminous herbs are particularly beneficial for long-tongued bumblebees (19).\n\nHowever, there are also limitations. The value of naturally regenerated margins for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may rely on the presence of thistle species, which are often considered pernicious weeds (20). Some studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles, and one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots in two out of three regions (562). Pernicious weeds can also be more common on uncropped cultivated margins (562). Additionally, a UK study found a lower proportion of young grey partridges in populations in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (562). There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees (19, 20).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
