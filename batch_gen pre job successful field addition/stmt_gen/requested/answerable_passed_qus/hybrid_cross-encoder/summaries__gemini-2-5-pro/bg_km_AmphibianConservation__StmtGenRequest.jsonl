[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different partial harvesting methods in USA forests compare to clearcutting in their impact on salamander populations?\nanswer: A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America indicated that partial harvesting, which encompasses methods like harvesting groups of trees, shelterwood harvesting, and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting (844, 851, 852).\n\nWhen compared to clearcutting, three studies in the USA on harvesting trees in small groups did not find a higher abundance of amphibians or salamanders (844). For shelterwood harvesting, three studies in the USA found that it led to higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance in comparison to clearcutting (851). In the case of thinning, two of four studies in the USA discovered higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response in thinned forests, while the other two studies had mixed results depending on the species and time since harvest (852). One study found that emigrating salamanders used thinned forests significantly more than clearcuts (852).\n\nIn contrast to unharvested areas, harvesting trees in small groups was found in two US studies to significantly decrease salamander abundance and alter species composition (844). Similarly, two out of three US studies showed that shelterwood harvesting also decreased salamander abundance and changed the composition of species when compared to areas with no harvesting (851). Studies on thinning compared to unharvested forests have shown mixed effects, with some species' abundance increasing while others, like the ensatina salamanders, decreased (852). Another study noted a negative overall response of amphibians to thinning, although one study found that a high volume of pre-existing downed wood helped prevent population declines after thinning (852).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Three studies in Sweden, the UK and USA found that eliminating fish using rotenone increased numbers of amphibian species, abundance, and recruitment of newt populations (828). However, the use of rotenone can also have negative effects. Two replicated studies in Pakistan and the UK found that when rotenone was applied, many frogs died and a small number of newts showed symptoms of negative effects (828).

Captive-bred Mallorcan midwife toads have been successfully raised to metamorphs or toadlets, with one UK study showing an 85% survival rate to metamorphosis (837). However, long-term captive breeding of this species (nine or more generations) has been associated with slower tadpole development, a reduction in one predator defense trait, and decreased genetic diversity (837). In contrast, reintroduction programs for the green and golden bell frog in Australia have had less success. Studies found that captive-bred green and golden bell frogs, released mainly as tadpoles, either did not establish breeding populations or only established them in one out of four release programs (872). Some captive-bred green and golden bell frogs released as tadpoles were found to have survived for at least 13 months after release (872). Other studies in Australia showed that a high proportion of captive-bred frogs released as eggs survived to metamorphosis, and there was limited breeding by released frogs (870). Additionally, the removal of viperine snakes in Mallorca led to an increase in the number of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae (830), and the addition of salt to a pond in Australia helped a population of green and golden bell frogs remain free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (762).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Six of these ten studies, which included five replicated studies in Denmark, Spain, the UK, and the USA, along with a global review, found that releasing head-started tadpoles, metamorphs, or juveniles led to the establishment of breeding frog populations or an increase in the populations of frogs or toads [881].

This was the case at sites with only road closures and at sites that also had assisted crossings and barrier fences (842). Seven of eight studies found that installing barrier fencing along with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (756). The effectiveness of these barriers can be dependent on the length and material of the fence (756). Some amphibians, such as treefrogs and 10% of common toads, were found to be able to climb over barrier fencing (756). For green frogs and leopard frogs, barriers of at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent them from climbing over (756). One study found that only a low number of amphibians were diverted by barriers (756). In six of seven studies, the installation of culverts or tunnels as road crossings was found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths, although one of these studies noted this was only true when barrier fencing was also installed (884). One study found no effect on road deaths from installing culverts or tunnels (884). Fifteen of twenty-four studies found that culverts and tunnels were used by amphibians, however, five studies found that they were used by less than 10% of amphibians or not used at all (884). The use of culverts and tunnels by amphibians can be affected by their diameter, length, lighting, and substrate (884). Some culvert designs were found to be unsuitable for amphibians, and one study highlighted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road where tunnels were installed (884).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In Denmark and Switzerland, 29-100% of created ponds were colonized by common and midwife toads (868). Captive-bred garlic toads, however, did not colonize newly created ponds (868). The creation and restoration of ponds, when combined with head-starting, led to an increase in European fire-bellied toad populations in Denmark (868). In Switzerland, midwife toads reproduced in 16% of created ponds (868).

Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia found that the removal of coarse woody debris from standing forest did not decrease amphibian diversity or overall amphibian abundance, but did reduce species richness in one study [843]. Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found no significant difference in abundance in clearcuts with woody debris retained or removed for eight of nine amphibian species, but the overall response of amphibians was more negative where woody debris was retained [843]. One randomized, replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the USA found that compared to total clearcutting, leaving dead or wildlife trees did not result in higher abundances of salamanders [845]. Two studies in the USA found that compared to no harvesting, leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not prevent a decrease in salamander abundance or change in species composition [845]. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA found that within clearcut forest, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas, and was similar in wood piles to unharvested forest [843]. One randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were similar with removal or creation of dead trees within forest [845]. One replicated, controlled study in the USA found that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed [843]. There is no evidence for the effect of retaining patches of trees rather than clearcutting on amphibian populations [847].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and potential negative impacts of releasing captive-bred or head-started toads into the wild?\nanswer: Captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs have been found to establish populations in some cases (875, 873). In one instance, 70% of release sites were populated (875), and for Mallorcan midwife toads, breeding populations were established at 38% to 100% of sites (873). Head-starting amphibians has also been shown to establish or increase populations of frogs and toads. Nine out of ten studies found that head-started amphibians metamorphosed, survived their first season, winter or year, or bred successfully (881). Furthermore, four studies found that frog survival to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis was greater, and time to metamorphosis was shorter in head-started individuals when compared to their wild counterparts (881).\n\nHowever, there are also documented negative impacts. The release of captive-bred toads did not lead to established populations in one study (875). In Puerto Rico, the survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low, with 25% being predated within just two days of release (875). For the Mallorcan midwife toad, a reintroduced population that was captive-bred was found to have reduced genetic diversity (873). Additionally, some studies on head-starting amphibians found that the release of metamorphs or adults did not prevent a frog population decline or establish a breeding toad population, with one study noting adult survival at a low rate of 1-17% over four years (881). In one Canadian study, young head-started leopard frogs were found to be smaller than those in the wild (881).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In contrast, three studies found that harvesting trees in small groups did not lead to higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (844). However, a meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America indicated that partial harvesting, which includes shelterwood, group harvesting, and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 844, 852). When compared to no harvesting, both shelterwood harvesting and harvesting trees in small groups were found to decrease salamander abundance and alter species composition (851, 844). Two studies on thinning found higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response in thinned forests compared to clearcut forests (852).\n\nIn terms of reproductive effects, one study found that the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs, the number of eggs per female, and the proportion of juveniles were similar or lower in plots with shelterwood harvesting compared to unharvested plots (851).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What design and placement factors are associated with the successful use of road tunnels by migrating amphibians?\nanswer: The successful use of road tunnels by migrating amphibians is associated with several design and placement factors. The use of culverts or tunnels as road crossings has been found to significantly decrease amphibian road deaths in six of seven studies (884). For these tunnels to be effective, they often need to be used in conjunction with barrier fencing to guide amphibians to the entrances (884). One study found that barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent some frog species from climbing over (756).\n\nSeveral design characteristics of the tunnels themselves have been shown to affect their use by amphibians. Wider culverts were used more in three of six studies, while long culverts were avoided in one of two studies (884). The substrate within the tunnel is also a factor, with natural substrates being used more in three of six studies (884). Other factors that have been studied with mixed effects include lighting, the presence of water, entrance location, and tunnel climate (884). Certain designs have proven to be unsuitable, such as one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes, which led to high mortality in common toads, and steel culverts, from which condensation deposits had very high metal concentrations (884). In one case, raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between two wetlands also significantly decreased the deaths of migrating amphibians (840).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Antifungal treatments have been found to be effective in many cases, with twelve out of sixteen studies showing they cured or increased the survival of amphibians with the disease (882). Specifically, the fungicide itraconazole was effective at curing amphibians in six of eight studies (882). Additionally, temperature treatment has shown promise, with four out of five studies demonstrating that increasing the enclosure or water temperature to 30\u201337\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis (770).\n\nHowever, these treatments are not always successful. In four studies, antifungal treatments did not cure the disease but only reduced infection levels or had mixed results (882). Furthermore, some fungicides were found to cause death or other negative side effects in amphibians in six studies (882). One study found that itraconazole only reduced infection levels, and another reported mixed effects (882). Temperature treatment also has its limitations, as one study found that heat treatment did not cure northern leopard frogs (770). Lastly, a study on wild midwife toads found that treating them with a fungicide, in conjunction with pond drying, only reduced infection levels and did not eradicate the chytridiomycosis (767).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
