[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: When restoring grasslands, how do the outcomes of simply disturbing the soil before seeding compare to removing the topsoil entirely?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, removing topsoil entirely before seeding generally produces more favorable outcomes than simply disturbing the soil. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK found that removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass species richness and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing (Action 3415). Studies on topsoil removal show multiple benefits: one replicated, randomized, controlled study in France found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant community similarity to that of intact steppe and increased plant species richness, while a replicated, controlled study in the UK found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased the species richness of sown plants (Action 3415). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that removing topsoil before planting or sowing increased the survival of native grass seedlings and plants (Action 3415). In contrast, studies on soil disturbance alone show more limited benefits: one randomized, replicated, controlled study in the UK found that soil disturbance increased the abundance or species richness of specialist and generalist plant species, but a controlled study in South Africa found that digging soil did not alter vegetation cover or the density of native plants (Action 1728). Additionally, studies combining soil disturbance with seeding show that soil disturbance using a rotovator and spreading clippings of heathland plants increased the number of heathland plants, while stripping surface soil layers and adding seed reduced the cover of perennial rye-grass more effectively (Action 1711).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In European grasslands, how does post-seeding management by mowing compare to livestock grazing for enhancing sown species?\nanswer: Based on European studies, both mowing and livestock grazing after seeding show effectiveness for enhancing sown species, with some important differences. For mowing management after seeding, a UK study found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock (3419). Additionally, mowing after sowing increased the richness of sown species and the abundance of sown forb species (3419). More frequent mowing also proved beneficial, with a German study showing that mowing more frequently after sowing seeds increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (3419). For livestock grazing after seeding, an Italian study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing (3423). However, a UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds reduced sown species cover compared to grazing with sheep, and grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to cutting vegetation (3423). The evidence suggests differential effects between cattle and sheep grazing, with a UK study showing that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (3423). Direct comparisons indicate mixed results: one UK study found cutting vegetation yearly after sowing increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock, while another found winter grazing after sowing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings (3423, 3419). The frequency and timing of management also matter, with German studies showing that cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing increased characteristic grassland species richness compared to cutting once per year (3419).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of adding soil amendments like mycorrhiza or topsoil prior to seeding?\nanswer: Studies have documented several effects of adding soil amendments like mycorrhiza and topsoil prior to seeding. For mycorrhiza inoculation, five studies examined effects on grassland vegetation and found mixed results (action 3429). Mycorrhiza inoculation before seeding initially increased vegetation cover in one study, but after three years vegetation cover did not differ between inoculated and non-inoculated areas. One study found mycorrhiza addition increased abundance of target conservation priority species, while another found it increased cover of three of 38 native prairie species. Mycorrhiza inoculation increased plant height but did not affect plant biomass or emergence rates. However, mycorrhiza did not alter plant species richness in one study. For topsoil addition, documented effects include increased plant species richness and increased biomass of sown species in most cases when topsoil was added before seeding (action 3420). When topsoil was added alongside seeding, it increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil addition alone (action 1857). More generally, topsoil addition increased cover or abundance of plant species, increased plant cover and number of species, though these remained lower than undisturbed sites, and increased number of seedlings for majority of plants tested (action 1686). Additional soil amendments showed varied effects: adding carbon to soil after seeding either reduced or did not alter density of sown forb species (action 3433), while adding charcoal before seeding did not alter overall plant biomass or grass cover but increased legume cover (action 3422).

One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study found that sowing seeds at a higher density increased both forb species richness and forb cover, as well as increased grass cover and increased the number of purple needlegrass seedlings. However, one site comparison study found that sowing grass seeds at a higher density reduced the cover of native grassland shrubs, and one replicated, controlled study found that higher density seeding did not alter the cover of sown plant species. Studies on broader grassland restoration approaches in the USA show mixed results. Twelve studies in North America examined sowing native grass and forbs (Action 3432), with some studies finding increased overall plant species richness, increased species richness of native plants, and increased cover of native plant species and sown species. However, effectiveness varied, with some studies showing no change in vegetation abundance. Six studies in North America examined sowing grass seeds only (Action 3397), with three of four studies finding that this approach did not change or reduced overall plant species richness, and some studies finding reduced abundance of native forb species and shrub species. Overall grassland restoration studies from the USA, Canada and Iceland found that species richness on restored grassland sites was similar to remnant habitats or higher than unrestored sites, with some target species using restored grasslands and higher abundances or densities of some species compared to unrestored sites (Action 361).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

European studies showed mixed outcomes for plant species richness: one Italian study found that post-seeding grazing increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing, while one UK study found that post-seeding grazing reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing. A Hungarian study found that grazing after sowing seeds did not alter the cover of target plant species compared to sowing without grazing. UK studies also examined different livestock types, finding that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep, but reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing. One UK study found that winter grazing after sowing resulted in higher survival of cut-leaved cranesbill seedlings. In contrast, the single USA study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased native plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing, but reduced the cover of native plant species compared to sowing without grazing.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions are available to increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, multiple actions can increase the abundance of sown or planted species in grassland restoration projects. \n\n**Seeding strategies and timing:** Sowing seeds at a higher density can increase the cover of individual plant species like thickspike wheatgrass and increase the number of purple needlegrass seedlings, though effects on overall sown species cover are mixed (Action 3405). Sowing seeds at the start of the growing season increased the cover of sown grass and forb species compared to autumn sowing and increased the number of sown species (Action 3407). Increasing the number of species in seed mix showed mixed effects, with one study finding increased cover of sown plant species while another found no change (Action 3406).\n\n**Site preparation methods:** Applying herbicide before seeding increased the cover of sown grass species and increased sown species richness (Action 3418). Disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased plant emergence in most cases and improved seedling survival in some studies (Action 3413). Removing leaf litter before seeding showed mixed effects on seedling emergence of sown species (Action 3414).\n\n**Soil amendments and treatments:** Adding fertilizer to soil before or after seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and density of sown species while others found no change (Action 3427). Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza before seeding increased the abundance of target species considered a local conservation priority and increased cover of some native prairie species (Action 3429).\n\n**Post-establishment management:** Mowing after seeding increased the abundance of sown forb species and increased sown species richness, with more frequent mowing increasing abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419). Using erosion blankets after seeding showed mixed effects on vegetation (Action 3431).\n\n**Direct planting approaches:** Plant grassland plants increased species richness of grasses in 50% of cases and forbs in 83% of cases, with planted species having mixed effects on abundance (Action 3399). Sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the abundance of sown species in most cases, with five of six studies finding positive effects (Action 3432).\n\n**Spatial strategies:** Sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species when using large gaps compared to smaller gaps (Action 3409). Sowing grassland seeds from a local source increased the abundance of some characteristic plant species and increased cover of target plant species when combined with increased species diversity (Action 3400).\n\n**Water management:** Irrigating after seeding showed limited evidence, with one study finding no change in vegetation cover (Action 3430).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Soil disturbance before seeding was found to increase plant emergence in most cases compared to sowing alone, with four of five studies across the USA, Germany, China and Spain demonstrating increased emergence, while one of two studies found that disturbing soil before sowing increased seedling survival (action 3413). Topsoil or turf removal before seeding showed positive effects on survival, with two studies in the USA finding that removing topsoil before planting California oatgrass or sowing and planting purple needlegrass increased the survival of seedlings and plants (action 3415). Herbicide application before seeding demonstrated benefits for emergence, with one study in Germany finding that spraying with herbicide before sowing seeds increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (action 3418). In direct comparisons within European studies, removing turf before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil before sowing in a UK study (action 3415). One UK study found that rotovating soil before sowing seeds increased both grass and forb species richness compared to harrowing before sowing (action 3413). French studies showed that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness and community similarity to intact steppe (action 3415).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Only two studies specifically examined vegetation structure effects from grassland interventions. Two replicated studies in the USA and Italy found that sowing grassland seeds from a local source did not alter vegetation height compared to sowing non-native grass seeds or a commercial seed mix (Action 3400). No other grassland seeding or planting interventions had any evidence for effects on vegetation structure - this includes sowing seeds at higher density (Action 3405), increasing the number of species in seed mix (Action 3406), sowing seeds in prepared gaps within vegetation (Action 3409), removing vegetation before seeding/planting (Action 3416), adding topsoil before seeding/planting (Action 3420), removing leaf litter before seeding/planting (Action 3414), and irrigating before or after seeding/planting (Action 3430). These interventions showed evidence for effects on vegetation community composition, species richness/diversity, vegetation abundance, and germination/emergence, but no studies measured vegetation structure outcomes. The evidence base focuses primarily on species establishment, abundance, and diversity outcomes rather than structural characteristics of the vegetation.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Studies of sowing native grass and forbs together found that this approach increased forb species richness in 71% of cases in the UK (action 3432). Three of four replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the Czech Republic and the USA found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover or density of forb species, though one study found that forb cover increased after one year but did not differ from unsown areas after 10 years (action 3432).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of post-seeding management, specifically mowing versus grazing, on grassland vegetation in the UK?\nanswer: Post-seeding management practices in grasslands show distinct effects on vegetation outcomes. Mowing after seeding/planting increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in UK studies (Action 3419). Specifically, cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds resulted in higher plant species richness than livestock grazing (Action 3419). Mowing also increased the richness of sown species after seeding, with one UK study showing that mowing after sowing seeds increased sown species richness (Action 3419). Additionally, cutting sown plots each year and removing cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). \n\nFor grazing effects, one UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, the same study also found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep grazing (Action 3423). Grazing with livestock after sowing seeds generally reduced plant species richness compared to cutting vegetation after sowing (Action 3423).\n\nRegarding mowing frequency, cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing seeds increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year in German studies (Action 3419). More frequent mowing also increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species (Action 3419).\n\nThe timing of management also matters, as studies showed that delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness in some cases (Action 131).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
