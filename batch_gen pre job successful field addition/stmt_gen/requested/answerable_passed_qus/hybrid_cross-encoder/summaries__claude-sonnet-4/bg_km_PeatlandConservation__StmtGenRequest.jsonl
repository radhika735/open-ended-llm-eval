[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To restore peatlands afforested for commercial forestry, how does simply cutting the trees compare to cutting trees and also rewetting the peat?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, cutting trees combined with rewetting peat appears more effective than cutting trees alone for peatland restoration. Action 1732 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations and rewetting peat increased the abundance of wetland-characteristic plants (2 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (2 paired studies in Sweden and Finland), increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (7 studies), and increased plant species richness (2 controlled studies in rich fens in Sweden). In contrast, Action 1731 shows that cutting/removing forest plantations alone increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges (3 studies), but had mixed effects on Sphagnum moss cover - one study reported Sphagnum cover decreased over three years following tree removal in a drained rich fen, though another study found Sphagnum cover increased in partly rewetted fens. Notably, Action 1731 indicates that tree removal had a much smaller effect on plant species richness in drained plots compared to rewetted plots. Action 1756 demonstrates that rewetting alone (without tree removal) typically reduced or had no effect on tree and shrub cover (10 studies), increased Sphagnum moss cover (12 studies), and increased cover of various herb groups including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes. The combination approach (Action 1732) changed overall plant community composition to become less like sites that remained drained and forested, while tree removal alone (Action 1731) showed more limited effects on overall plant community composition.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The documented management approaches include: restricting pedestrian access to peatlands (Action 1751), installing boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling (Action 1753), adopting ecotourism principles/creating an ecotourism site (Action 1755), wearing snowshoes to prevent trampling (Action 1754), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes (Action 2152).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the typical effects of rewetting on the vegetation of drained peatlands?\nanswer: Based on 36 studies evaluating rewetting effects on peatland vegetation, rewetting typically causes significant changes in plant community composition, with drier grassland communities being replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities (Action 1756). Rewetting increases the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants (Action 1756). For moss cover, 12 studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in bogs, fens or other peatlands, though three studies reported mixed responses by species (Action 1756). Rewetting typically increases herb cover, with 21 studies reporting increased cover of at least one group of herbs - specifically increasing sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, cottongrass cover in 8 of 9 studies, and reed/rush cover in 5 of 7 studies (Action 1756). For trees and shrubs, 10 studies found that rewetting typically reduced or had no effect on tree and/or shrub cover (Action 1756). Three of four studies examining overall vegetation cover reported that rewetting increased it (Action 1756). Regarding plant diversity, 6 studies reported that rewetting increased total plant species richness or diversity, though 5 studies found no effect and 1 study found rewetting reduced plant diversity (Action 1756). Studies using multiple restoration interventions including rewetting also found increases in moss cover, herb cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants, and overall vegetation cover (Action 1803). Irrigation studies similarly showed that wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs colonized irrigated areas while dryland grasses decreased (Action 1859).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For degraded peatlands, how do the effects of completely excluding livestock compare to reducing grazing intensity?\nanswer: Based on the available studies, there are different effects between completely excluding livestock versus reducing grazing intensity on degraded peatlands. For complete livestock exclusion (Action 1734), ten studies evaluated effects on peatland vegetation, with seven studies in bogs, two in fens and one in unspecified peatland. Complete exclusion typically had no effect on key herb groups, with five of five studies finding no effect on cottongrass cover and two of two studies reporting no effect on sedge cover. Five replicated, paired, controlled studies found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover, though responses sometimes varied between species and sites. Results for shrub cover were mixed - four studies found no effect on shrub cover, while three studies found that excluding livestock increased shrub cover. One study found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass but had no effect on biomass of grass-like herbs. In contrast, for reducing grazing intensity (Action 1735), one study in UK bogs found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower for one species, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower. The evidence suggests that reducing grazing intensity may produce more consistent positive effects on vegetation cover and biomass compared to complete exclusion, which showed more variable results across different vegetation types.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 1762 reports that grazing can increase cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges, and grass-like plants in fens, and can reduce shrub cover, helping prevent succession.\n\n**Cutting trees and shrubs** provides another management approach.

Action 3056 demonstrates that prescribed burning in freshwater swamps can maintain vegetation structure and increase grass cover.\n\n**Physical plant removal** techniques are documented. Action 1768 shows that physically removing problematic plants, particularly moss carpets, can increase cover of fen-characteristic plants and plant species richness in some conditions.\n\n**Litter removal** represents another intervention option. Action 3062 indicates that removing plant litter from freshwater marshes can create plant communities characteristic of wetter conditions and increase wetland plant cover.\n\n**Turf stripping** is available as a more intensive intervention.

For butterfly species richness, fens managed by mowing had greater species richness than fens managed by cattle grazing (Action 3950). Direct comparisons in fen meadows found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows (Action 1762). However, grazed and mown fen meadows had similar vegetation structure and differed in overall plant community composition (Actions 1759, 1762). For vegetation effects specifically, mowing in fens and fen meadows typically increased plant species richness, altered overall plant community composition, increased cover of fen-characteristic plants, increased moss/bryophyte cover, and reduced herb cover including bindweed, reeds, sedges, and purple moor grass (Action 1759). Grazing showed more variable effects: it increased cover of some herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, had mixed effects on shrub cover, and showed inconsistent effects on plant species richness (Action 1762). Both management approaches affected plant community composition compared to no management, but the specific outcomes differed between cutting and grazing regimes in fen ecosystems.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What interventions are available to restore peatland vegetation on sites previously used for commercial forest plantations?\nanswer: Several interventions are available to restore peatland vegetation on sites previously used for commercial forest plantations:\n\n**Removing Forest Plantations**: Cutting/removing/thinning forest plantations can increase cover of characteristic peatland herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, and reduce cover of forest-characteristic mosses (Action 1731). This intervention can also increase total plant species richness, particularly in rich fens (Action 1731).\n\n**Combined Tree Removal and Rewetting**: The most comprehensive approach involves cutting/removing trees combined with rewetting peat, which has been evaluated in eleven studies across bogs and fens (Action 1732). This intervention increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, can increase Sphagnum moss cover, and increases cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges (Action 1732). Two replicated studies reported this intervention increased plant species richness in rich fens (Action 1732).\n\n**Rewetting Alone**: Rewetting peatland by raising the water table has been evaluated in thirty-six studies and typically replaces drier grassland communities with more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities (Action 1756). Twelve studies reported that rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance, and twenty-one studies reported increased cover of characteristic herbs including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds/rushes (Action 1756).\n\n**Active Vegetation Establishment**: Direct planting of peatland trees/shrubs shows successful survival in most cases, with eight studies reporting majority survival over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years (Action 1820). Directly planting peatland mosses shows good survival and growth, with planted mosses establishing and spreading beyond introduction sites (Action 1818). Adding moss fragments to peatland surfaces results in Sphagnum presence after 1-4 growing seasons with cover ranging from negligible to >90%, with six controlled studies showing higher Sphagnum cover in sown versus unsown plots (Action 1821). Adding mixed vegetation fragments containing Sphagnum to bog surfaces results in Sphagnum presence after 1-6 growing seasons, though five studies reported low cover unless plots were mulched after spreading (Action 1822).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants in four studies in Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Action 1759 also documented that mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies in Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants in six studies. Action 3950 found that fens managed by mowing had greater species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing in Switzerland.\n\n**Benefits of Grazing:**\nAction 3971 found that wet meadows managed by light grazing with cattle or horses had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies to those managed by mowing once per year in autumn in Germany. Action 696 documented that maintaining traditional water meadows resulted in increased population size or number of territories of northern lapwing, common redshank and black-tailed godwit and increased plant species richness. Action 1762 reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants in two studies in UK fens.\n\n**Trade-offs and Negative Effects:**\nAction 3950 found that recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs than uncut fens in the Netherlands, and that large copper caterpillar survival was lower in recently cut fens and fens cut in autumn or winter than in uncut fens. Action 3971 documented that after cattle grazing began on wet grassland, the number of bog fritillaries which emerged and their use of grazed areas was lower than before grazing started in Belgium. Action 696 found that common snipe declined on all sites under management to maintain traditional water meadows. Action 1762 found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer overall plant species than mown meadows in Germany.\n\n**Timing Effects:**\nAction 1771 found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in UK fen meadows. Action 3070 reported that the effect of cutting on plant species richness and vegetation abundance depended on the month of mowing between June and November in Belgian wet grasslands.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the typical outcomes for vegetation when the upper layer of degraded peatland soil is removed or disturbed without subsequent planting?\nanswer: When the upper layer of degraded peatland soil is removed without subsequent planting, several vegetation outcomes have been documented across 10 studies (Action 1809). Plant community composition changes significantly, with five studies reporting that plots stripped of topsoil developed plant communities with different composition compared to unstripped peatlands. The depth of soil stripping affects plant community development. Characteristic wetland or peatland plants increase in cover, with four studies showing increased cover of wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants after 4-13 years. Herb cover patterns vary, with three studies finding increased cover of rushes, reeds or sedges after 2-6 years, though one study reported no effect on sedge or bentgrass cover after five years. Two studies found reduced purple moor grass cover for 2-5 years. Vegetation biomass decreases, with two studies finding reduced vegetation biomass for up to 18 years, though one study found no effect after four years. Plant species richness and diversity generally increase, with three studies reporting increased total plant species richness over 2-18 years, though effects varied between sites in some studies. When peatland surfaces are disturbed without planting (Action 1811), two studies showed affected plant community development over 2-3 years, with disturbed plots developing greater cover of weedy species from the seed bank, and wetland or fen-characteristic species colonizing disturbed areas, though peat-forming species did not colonize in one study.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides direct legal protection, what alternative policy or financial incentives can be used to encourage peatland conservation?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several alternative policy and financial incentives can be used to encourage peatland conservation beyond direct legal protection:\n\nPayment schemes to landowners are a primary alternative approach. Action 1799 shows that agri-environment schemes in the UK can pay landowners to protect peatlands, with mixed effectiveness on bog habitats, protecting the area of bog habitat in three of six cases. Similar payment approaches are used for other wetland types, with Action 3387 describing programs that pay stakeholders to protect marshes or swamps, including agri-environment rules for managing farmland ditches in the UK and micro-credits for sustainable development in Nigeria that led to 58 communities switching from practices that damaged mangrove forests to more sustainable practices.\n\nAgri-environment schemes represent a broader policy mechanism for conservation incentives. Actions 962 and 700 detail how these schemes pay farmers to cover the costs of conservation measures, though their effectiveness varies across different species and habitats. Action 700 notes that European agri-environment schemes have shown mixed results, with some studies finding increases in population size or density of birds and other wildlife on scheme sites compared to non-scheme sites, while other studies found negative or no effects.\n\nCampaign and advocacy approaches can also drive policy change without requiring direct legal protection. Action 1849 describes how lobbying and campaigning for peatland protection in the UK led to increased area of protected peatland, behavior changes among major retailers who stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and conservation agreements signed by garden centres and local governments.\n\nAdditional approaches mentioned include ecosystem service-based payments, such as the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) mechanism referenced in Action 1509 for forest conservation, and ecotourism development as mentioned in Action 1755, though no specific studies were found evaluating ecotourism's effectiveness for peatland conservation.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species than unmown plots, and mowing typically increased Sphagnum moss cover while reducing purple moor grass cover (Action 1770). For maintaining/restoring disturbance in fens, cutting/mowing altered overall plant community composition and increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants (Action 1759). Six studies found that mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall (Action 1759). Most studies showed that mowing/cutting increased plant species richness in fens and fen meadows compared to no mowing (Action 1759).\n\n**Cutting Large Trees/Shrubs:**\nStudies in fens found that cutting and removing trees/shrubs to maintain/restore disturbance resulted in plant community composition becoming more like target fen meadows and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Cutting and removing trees increased herb cover and biomass in forested fens (Action 1761). For controlling problematic large trees/shrubs, studies reported that plant community composition changed to become more like undegraded, open fen, with increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, and increased moss and vascular plant cover and species richness (Action 1772).\n\n**Complete Physical Removal:**\nPhysical removal of problematic plants in fens showed that removing mossy vegetation increased cover of fen-characteristic plants (Action 1768). However, moss removal had mixed effects on herb cover after 2-5 years, with results varying between species and sites (Action 1768). Removing moss carpet reduced total bryophyte and Sphagnum moss cover for three years, and moss removal increased plant species richness but only in drained areas (Action 1768).\n\n**Seasonal Timing Effects:**\nStudies found that plant species richness increased more over two years in summer-mown plots than spring- or autumn-mown plots in fen meadows (Action 1771).\n\n**Litter Removal:**\nRemoving plant litter in fens and fen meadows generally did not affect plant community composition or bryophyte cover, though one study found it increased plant species richness and diversity (Action 1760).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands, and how do their effects compare?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several alternatives to completely removing livestock from degraded agricultural peatlands have been identified, though research on their effects varies in scope and availability. \n\nThe primary alternative with documented effects is reducing intensity of livestock grazing (Action 1735). One study in bogs found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, cottongrass cover was greater where grazing intensity was lower for one species, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower.\n\nIn comparison, complete exclusion or removal of livestock from degraded peatlands (Action 1734) showed mixed results across ten studies. Seven studies found that excluding or removing livestock typically had no effect on cover of key herb groups, with five studies showing no effect on cottongrass cover and two showing no effect on sedge cover. Five studies found that excluding livestock typically had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover, and four studies found no effect on shrub cover specifically for heather or heathland communities. However, one study found that excluding sheep increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass.\n\nOther potential alternatives lack research evidence. No studies were found evaluating the effects of limiting livestock density on farmland near peatlands (Action 1786), using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (Action 1733), or changing the season/timing of livestock grazing (Action 1737). Additionally, using grazing to maintain or restore disturbance (Action 1762) was evaluated in four studies in fens, with mixed results including increased cover of some herb groups and reduced shrub cover in some cases, but no studies specifically addressed this approach for degraded agricultural peatlands.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Reducing harvest intensity (action 1744) has one replicated, controlled study from a bog in New Zealand that found Sphagnum moss cover was higher three years after harvesting when some Sphagnum was left in plots compared to complete harvesting. All other strategies have no supporting studies: using low impact harvesting techniques (action 1745), reducing frequency of harvest (action 1743), using low impact vehicles for harvesting (action 1746), providing new technologies to reduce pressure on wild biological resources (action 1748), implementing mosaic management when harvesting wild biological resources (action 1747), allowing sustainable use of peatlands (action 1801), using low-impact methods to harvest vegetation in brackish/saline swamps (action 3012), and restricting vehicle use on peatlands (action 1749) all lack direct evaluation studies.

The moss layer transfer technique showed promising results, with restored areas developing greater moss or bryophyte cover (including Sphagnum) than unrestored areas after 4-8 years, and vegetation becoming more similar to local natural bogs (Action 1804). Adding mosses directly to peatland surfaces demonstrated variable success, with Sphagnum cover ranging from negligible to greater than 90% after 1-4 growing seasons across multiple sites in the UK, Canada, Finland, and Germany, with six controlled studies finding higher Sphagnum cover in sown than unsown plots (Action 1821). Direct planting of mosses showed survival rates of 47 out of 50 Sphagnum-dominated sods after one year in Lithuania, with studies reporting increased moss cover and growth after planting in the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Estonia, and Australia (Action 1818). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces resulted in Sphagnum presence in plots across 17 studies in Canada, the USA, and Estonia, with cover ranging from less than 1% to 73% after 1-6 growing seasons, though five studies reported that Sphagnum cover was very low (less than 1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Replacing blocks of vegetation after peat extraction showed mixed results, with one UK study reporting declining Sphagnum moss cover in translocated blocks, while a Canadian study found that replaced vegetation blocks retained similar Sphagnum cover to an undisturbed fen (Action 1738). Multiple restoration interventions increased Sphagnum moss cover in studies from the Czech Republic and Estonia, though one UK study reported no change in Sphagnum cover following intervention (Action 1803).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
