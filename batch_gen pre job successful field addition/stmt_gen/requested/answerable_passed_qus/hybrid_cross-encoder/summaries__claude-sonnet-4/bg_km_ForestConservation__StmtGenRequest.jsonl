Six of seven studies found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1223). Group-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with four of eight studies finding that it increased cover and diversity of understory plants, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness (Action 1224). General logging within forests showed moderate effectiveness, with four of seven studies finding that logging trees increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action 1273). Single tree selection harvesting had similar species richness of moths to group selection harvesting or clearcutting but lower species richness than unharvested forest (Action 3867). Studies comparing different methods found that moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action 3871).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the main benefits and negative impacts of using prescribed fire as a management tool in North American forests?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, prescribed fire as a forest management tool in North America shows mixed effects across different forest components. For tree populations, studies found that prescribed fire had variable effects on young trees - five of 15 studies found it increased density and biomass of young trees while two found it decreased new tree density, with eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (Action 1220). For mature trees, four of eight studies found prescribed fire decreased tree cover, density and diversity, while one found it increased tree cover and three found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1217). Seven studies found that prescribed fire increased tree mortality (Action 1217). \n\nRegarding understory vegetation, eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221). For plant diversity, 14 of 24 studies found prescribed fire increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found it decreased species richness and nine found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221).\n\nFor wildlife impacts, eight of 14 studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on amphibian abundance or numbers of species, while four found mixed effects depending on species, season or year of burn, three found fires increased amphibian abundance, and one found abundance decreased (Action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found that coniferous forest burned within the last 20 years had higher species richness than unburned forest, while one study found similar species richness between burned and unburned sites (Action 3877). Two studies found pine forest restored by burning had higher butterfly abundance than unburned forest (Action 3877).\n\nAfter tree planting, two of four studies found prescribed fire increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect (Action 1255).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the evidence for using shelterwood harvesting compare with clearcutting for promoting plant diversity and tree regeneration?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from action documents, shelterwood harvesting shows advantages over clearcutting for both plant diversity and tree regeneration. Three replicated, controlled studies in Sweden and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (Action 1214). Six of seven studies (including five replicated, controlled studies) in Australia, Iran, Nepal and the USA found that shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees, with only one study finding decreased plant species richness and abundance (Action 1223). For tree regeneration specifically, three of six studies found that clearcutting increased the density and species richness of young trees, while one found it decreased new tree density and two found no effect or mixed effects depending on the tree species (Action 1222). In contrast, shelterwood harvesting generally showed positive effects on tree regeneration alongside its benefits for plant diversity.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In restored forest areas, what are some alternatives to using herbicides for controlling competing vegetation after tree planting, and how effective are they?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several alternatives to herbicides exist for controlling competing vegetation in restored forest areas after tree planting. Covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses (Action 1239). Covering the ground with mulch after planting increased total plant cover (Action 1240). Managing vegetation by hand through selective weeding has been evaluated, with studies showing mixed effects on species abundance (Action 3714). Managing vegetation by cutting or mowing has been tested, with studies finding that areas where vegetation was managed by cutting had similar reptile species richness and abundance compared to areas with no cutting (Action 3713). Physical removal of mid-storey vegetation in forest resulted in increased mammal species richness and abundance (Action 2480). Surface mulch applications showed that mulched and unmulched plots had similar plant species richness over two years, though mulched plots were more likely to contain certain species after 20 months (Action 3248).

For herbicide control, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive plant control using herbicide on the total native plant species richness (Actions 1229, 1314). For mechanical/manual removal, studies show varied outcomes: one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another replicated, controlled study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228). Additionally, one replicated, controlled study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but one replicated, controlled study in Hawaii found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species (Action 1228). For prescribed fire methods, there is no evidence found for the effects of using prescribed fire to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1196). Similarly, no evidence was found for the effects of using grazing to remove invasive plant species on forests (Action 1195). For biological control using herbivores, no evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1277). One controlled study from Australia found that prescribed burning for lantana control resulted in smaller and less abundant lantana plants compared to unburned areas, and one replicated site comparison from Australia found lantana in a forest burned every three years produced fewer fruits and seeds with higher seedling mortality and slower growth rates compared to other management methods (Action 912).

For forest-specific interventions, we found no evidence for the effect of raising awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information on forests (Action 1157), and no evidence for the effect of providing education programmes about forests on forests (Action 1158). \n\nHowever, evidence from other conservation contexts provides some insights. A review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement (Action 162). \n\nFor species conservation more broadly, five out of six studies found increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes, though in all but one case, education was one of several interventions employed.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented benefits and harms of amending soil with additives like organic matter, lime, or fertilizer after planting trees?\nanswer: Based on the documented evidence, soil amendments after tree planting show mixed results with both benefits and potential harms. Organic matter amendments have demonstrated varied effects: in brackish/saline wetlands, adding manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and manure dose (Action 3311). In freshwater wetlands, large amounts of compost amendment resulted in larger birch saplings three years after planting, but also led to plant communities characteristic of drier conditions and reduced plant species richness and diversity compared to unamended plots (Action 3310). Lime amendments showed potential negative effects, with one study finding that adding lime before restoration planting decreased the survival of pine seedlings, while another found no effect on oak seedling growth (Action 1259).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the main alternatives to clearcutting for timber harvesting, and how do they compare in terms of their effects on forest plants?\nanswer: The main alternatives to clearcutting for timber harvesting include shelterwood harvesting, selective harvesting/logging, group selection harvesting, thinning, and patch retention harvesting. Shelterwood harvesting increased abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as growth and survival rate of young trees according to six of seven studies (action 1223). Group-selection harvesting had mixed effects on forest plants - four of eight studies found it increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while two studies found it decreased understory species richness and biomass (action 1224). Selective or reduced impact logging showed variable outcomes - logging trees in forests increased density and cover of understory plants in five of ten studies, while five studies found no effect or mixed effects (action 1273). Four of seven studies found that logging trees in forests increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (action 1273). For comparison, clearcutting itself increased cover and species richness of understory plants in eight of 12 studies, while two studies found it decreased density and species richness of understory plants (action 1222). Thinning as an alternative showed that forest species richness of moths was higher after thinning than after clearcutting and was similar to unharvested forest (action 3868).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Three of four studies found that excluding livestock increased the size and density of regenerating trees and the number of regenerating trees, though one study found livestock exclusion decreased tree density but not tree size (Action 1205). Complete prevention of livestock grazing showed that two of three studies found increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants, with one study finding mixed effects (Action 1206). One study found that preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206).\n\nFor reducing grazing intensity, one study found that reducing grazing intensity increased the number of tree saplings, and another study found that reducing grazing intensity increased understory biomass (Action 1207).\n\nFor shortening the grazing period, one study found that shortening the livestock grazing period increased the abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, while one study found no effect on native plant species richness (Action 1208). One study found that the number of tree seedlings was higher following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208).\n\nThe effects on mammal populations from livestock exclusion varied: four out of eight studies found that excluding grazing livestock led to higher abundances of mule deer, small mammals and European rabbits (when combined with water provision), while other studies found higher densities of some but not all small mammal species or no effect on certain species (Action 2407). Two studies found more small mammal species on areas from which livestock were excluded (Action 2407).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For fire prevention signs, no evidence was found (action 1172). For prescribed burning, which is the most studied intervention, eight of 14 studies found no effect on amphibian abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance or species numbers (action 877). Prescribed fire effects on understory plants showed mixed results: eight of 22 studies found increased cover/density/biomass while six found decreases, and fourteen of 24 studies found increased species richness/diversity while nine found no effect or mixed effects (action 1221). Prescribed burning on deciduous forests showed minimal evidence with one study finding similar bird species richness in burned versus unburned areas and mixed results for specific species (action 317). For mechanical vegetation removal interventions, three studies found that mechanically removing understorey vegetation did not increase mammal abundances compared to prescribed burning (action 2482), while removing mid-storey vegetation increased mammal species richness and abundance in one study (action 2480). Creating fire breaks mechanically showed that areas with more recent/regular clearance had greater butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3881), and fire suppression combined with predator exclusion increased reptile abundance over time (action 3658). Many specific interventions completely lack evidence, including prescribed burning to reduce wildfire potential (action 1623), vegetation thinning to prevent wildfires (action 1764), zero burning policies near peatlands (action 1856), building fire breaks (actions 1766, 3080), raising water levels to prevent fires (action 3079), and prescribed burning to mimic natural fire cycles (action 1622).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

A literature review reported that a large number of cranes of seven species used nature reserves in China, whilst a replicated, randomised and controlled study from Argentina found that some guilds of birds were found at higher species richnesses in protected forests.\n\nAdopting protected species legislation (Action ID 1201): No evidence was found of the effects of adopting protected species legislation on forests.\n\nDesignating protected areas (Action ID 3384): Four studies evaluated the overall effects of designating protected areas involving marshes or swamps. Two studies in China reported that the area of marsh, swamp or unspecified wetland in protected areas declined over 6-12 years. One study in Puerto Rico reported that protection had no clear effect on mangrove forest area. One study of a mangrove forest in Malaysia reported that it retained at least 97% of its forest area over 98 years of protection as a forest reserve.\n\nEnforcing existing legislation for habitat protection (Action ID 2916): No specific evidence was found regarding enforcement of existing legislation for habitat protection.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do different methods of tree removal, such as logging, thinning, and clearcutting, compare in their effects on understory plants?\nanswer: Different tree removal methods show varying effects on understory plants based on evidence from multiple studies. Thinning appears to have the most consistent positive effects, with 17 of 25 studies finding that thinning trees in forests increased the density and cover of understory plants, and 13 of 19 studies showing increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). General logging/tree removal showed more mixed results, with 5 of 10 studies finding increased density and cover of understory plants, while 5 studies found no effect or mixed effects, and 4 of 7 studies found increased species richness and diversity while 3 found no effect (Action 1273). Clearcutting demonstrated variable outcomes, with 8 of 12 studies finding that clearcutting increased the cover and species richness of understory plants, while 2 found it decreased density and species richness, and 2 found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1222). Comparative studies suggest that thinning may be more effective than clearcutting for maintaining species richness, as one study found macro-moth species richness was higher after thinning than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with thinned forest richness similar to unharvested forest (Action 3868). Additionally, shelterwood harvesting showed faster species richness recovery compared to clearcutting, with one study finding moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action 3871).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Following restoration planting, which actions are most beneficial for promoting the survival and growth of the planted trees?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from restoration studies, several actions show potential benefits for promoting tree survival and growth after planting. Tree guards or shelters can increase survival rates, with light-colored plastic tree shelters being more effective than dark-colored ones, and can increase tree height in some cases (Action 1268). Fertilizer application after planting can increase tree size according to studies in Canada and Portugal, though results are mixed with some studies showing no effect (Action 1260). Ground covering with mulch increases total plant cover (Action 1240), while plastic mats decrease herbaceous plant and grass cover (Action 1239). Prescribed fire shows mixed results, with some studies finding increased survival and sprouting rates of planted trees (Action 1255). Mechanical removal of understory vegetation shows mostly no effect on seedling emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage, though one study found increased seedling biomass from removing competing herbs and another found increased growth rates from removing sheep laurel shrubs (Action 1256). Removing competing vegetation in wetland settings typically shows no clear effect on tree height, diameter, or survival, though some specific benefits were found for certain species under particular conditions (Action 3334). Adding lime to soil generally shows no benefit or may even decrease survival (Action 1259). Weed mats show no effect on seedling height (Action 1267).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of legal frameworks and public engagement initiatives for forest conservation?\nanswer: Evidence regarding legal frameworks for forest conservation shows mixed results. Legal protection of habitat has demonstrated some positive outcomes, with studies finding population increases following habitat protection and more positive population trends in protected areas compared to unprotected areas (Action 158). Specifically for primate habitats, legal protection resulted in increased primate numbers in China for rhesus monkeys and grey snub-monkeys, a 34% increase in Hainan gibbon numbers over nine years, and lower stress levels in black howler monkeys in protected areas compared to unprotected forest fragments in Mexico (Action 1578). However, legal protection was not always effective, as evidenced by decreased numbers of Tana River red colobus monkeys and crested mangabeys in Kenya despite legal protection (Action 1578). For marine and freshwater mammal habitat protection, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of enforcing existing legislation (Action 2916).\n\nEvidence regarding public engagement initiatives shows promising results for forest conservation. Community-based forest management demonstrated effectiveness in two studies from Ethiopia and Nepal, where forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (Action 1152). However, one study in Colombia found no difference in deforestation rates between community-managed forests and other management approaches (Action 1152). Community-based participation in land management showed positive outcomes, with an increasing population of Himalayan brown bears in Pakistan associated with local community involvement in park management, and fewer farmers removing large carnivores in Namibia when engaged in community-based management through conservancy membership (Action 2395). Providing monetary benefits to local communities for forest management showed mixed results, with black howler monkey numbers increasing by 138% in Belize over 13 years, but mountain gorilla numbers declining by 28% over 41 years in Rwanda, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo despite development projects in nearby communities (Action 1509). Increasing resources for managing protected areas resulted in higher mammal species richness and greater occupancy rates in a well-resourced national park compared to a less well-resourced forest reserve in Tanzania (Action 2564).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Logging or removing trees within forests decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility according to two of three studies conducted in Australia, Norway and Sweden (Action ID: 1270). Thinning trees within forests also had negative effects, with three of four studies in Canada, Finland, and Sweden finding that it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and species richness (Action ID: 1212). Additionally, one study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses (Action ID: 1234).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What management actions are available to aid forest recovery after a wildfire, and what is known about their effectiveness?\nanswer: Several management actions are available for forest recovery after wildfire, with varying effectiveness documented in scientific studies. Thinning trees after wildfire has been studied in five replicated, controlled studies across multiple countries. Two studies in Spain found that thinning increased plant species richness, one in Canada found it increased aspen sapling cover, while one study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one in Israel found it decreased mortality of pine seedlings (Action 1234). Post-fire salvage logging shows mixed results, with one study in Canada finding that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses (Action 1234).\n\nSeeding interventions have shown limited effectiveness for forest recovery. Three studies in the USA examining herbaceous plant seeding in burnt forest areas found it decreased the number and cover of native species and decreased tree seedling density, with no effect on total plant cover or species richness (Action 1236). However, sowing tree seeds specifically showed more promise, with one study in Brazil finding that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees (Action 1244).\n\nPrescribed fire as a post-planting management tool showed mixed results. Four studies in Finland, France and the USA found that two studies showed prescribed fire after replanting increased survival and sprouting rate of planted trees, while one study found fire decreased planted tree size and one found no effect on size and survival rate (Action 1255).\n\nDebris management is another post-fire action, with one study in Spain finding that removing burned trees and branches after wildfire did not increase European wild rabbit numbers compared to removing burned trees but leaving branches in place (Action 2478). Natural regeneration following disturbance showed time-dependent effects, with one study in Canada finding that natural forest regeneration increased moose numbers relative to more intensive management in the short- to medium-term but not in the longer term (Action 2634).\n\nFor logged forest areas, reseeding showed limited benefits. One study in the USA found that reseeded areas had similar reptile species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to areas left to regenerate naturally, and reptile communities in reseeded areas were not more similar to mature forest stands than those left to regenerate naturally (Action 3638).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the effectiveness of community-based forest management vary across different countries according to the available evidence?\nanswer: The effectiveness of community-based forest management varies significantly across different countries according to the available evidence. In Ethiopia and Nepal, two studies including one replicated, before-and-after, site comparison found that forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in forests not managed by local communities (Action 1152). However, in Colombia, one replicated, site comparison study found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests did not differ from deforestation rates in forests that were not managed by local communities, or in uninhabited national parks (Action 1152). \n\nAdditional evidence from other countries shows mixed results for community-based conservation approaches. In Pakistan, involving local communities with park management was associated with an increasing population of Himalayan brown bears (Action 2395). In Brazil, areas where community-based management of fishing practices was implemented had a higher abundance of river turtles than areas with no community-based management (Action 3681). In the Philippines, after rural community members were paid a small incentive to protect Philippine crocodile sanctuaries combined with an education and awareness campaign, fewer crocodiles were killed than before community engagement (Action 3681). In Mozambique, during a community-based turtle monitoring project no killing of adults was recorded and fewer sea turtle eggs were lost to poaching than before projects began (Action 3681).\n\nRegarding monetary incentives for forest management, results also vary by country. In Belize, numbers of black howler monkeys increased by 138% over 13 years after local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions (Action 1509). In the Republic of Congo, most central chimpanzees reintroduced to an area where local communities received monetary benefits, alongside other interventions, survived over five years (Action 1509). However, in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, numbers of mountain gorillas declined by 28% over 41 years despite the implementation of development projects in nearby communities, alongside other interventions (Action 1509).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
