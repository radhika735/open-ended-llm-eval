For loud noise deterrents, one controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that in areas where noise deterrents were used, along with tree nets, crop raiding by orangutans was reduced (Action 1449). Additionally, one study in the Democratic Republic Congo found that chasing gorillas and using random noise resulted in the return of gorillas from plantations to areas close to protected forest (Action 1449). In contrast, no evidence was found for the effects of humans chasing primates using bright light to deter crop-raiding on primate populations (Action 1450). The evidence indicates that loud noise methods have demonstrated positive results in reducing primate crop-raiding behavior, while bright light methods lack any documented evidence of effectiveness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Out of twelve identified conservation actions, only one action has actual evidence from systematic studies. For \"Use selective logging instead of clear-cutting\" (Action 1485), there are three studies providing evidence: one site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest that had been logged at low intensity than in a forest logged at high intensity; one before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging; and one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest that had been logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity. All other identified conservation actions have no evidence from systematic journal and report searches, including: using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas (Action 1497), closing non-essential roads as soon as logging operations are complete (Action 1496), certifying forest concessions and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1500), reducing the size of forestry teams to include employees only (Action 1499), implementing road blocks to inspect cars for illegal primate bushmeat (Action 1470), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (Action 1487), thinning trees within forests (Action 1491), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (Action 1495), providing domestic meat to workers of the logging company to reduce hunting (Action 1501), clearing open patches in the forest (Action 1490), and avoiding slashing climbers/lianas, trees housing them, hemi-epiphytic figs, and ground vegetation (Action 1493).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the typical outcomes when primates are reintroduced into habitats where the same species is already present?\nanswer: When primates are reintroduced into habitats where the same species is already present, survival outcomes vary significantly across species and time periods. Four before-and-after studies in Guinea and the Republic of Congo found that the majority of reintroduced chimpanzees survived for at least one to five years after reintroduction (Action 1591). However, one study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements, while a study in Senegal found that a reintroduced chimpanzee was reunited with its mother (Action 1591).\n\nFor orangutans, one study in Malaysia found that a majority survived reintroduction, but a controlled study in Malaysia found that a reintroduced population had declined 33 years after reintroduction (Action 1591). Population outcomes also varied: one study in Belize found that primate population increased five years after reintroduction, while one study in Thailand found that primate population declined post-reintroduction (Action 1591).\n\nSurvival rates showed mixed patterns.

A before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased after the construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps (Action 1457). In Madagascar, a before-and-after study found that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines (Action 1457).\n\n**Rope Bridges Between Canopies:** Nine studies found that rope bridges were used by a range of mammals, with seven studies finding between three and 25 species using rope bridges (Action 2556).

Wearing face-masks is recommended to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates (Action 1537). Studies show that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and visitors wearing face-masks, alongside other interventions. Limiting the time that researchers and tourists are allowed to spend with habituated animals is another important measure (Action 1539), with mountain gorilla populations increasing by 168% over 41 years while being visited during restricted time periods. Ensuring that researchers and tourists are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy is essential (Action 1546), as mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while sick/unwell researchers and visitors were not allowed to visit gorillas. Regular disinfection of clothes and boots is recommended (Action 1547), with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and tourists whose clothes were disinfected. Maintaining a safety distance to habituated animals is crucial (Action 1538), with mountain gorilla numbers increasing by 168% over 41 years while being observed from a safety distance. Additional recommended measures include implementing quarantine for people arriving at and leaving the site (Action 1540), wearing gloves when handling primate food and tool items (Action 1548), avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates (Action 1555), and putting up signs to warn people about not feeding primates (Action 1507), which reduced aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans after prohibiting tourist feeding.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the comparative outcomes of different supplementary feeding strategies for primates?\nanswer: Different supplementary feeding strategies for primates show varying outcomes based on timing, duration, and approach. Regular continuous supplementary feeding shows mixed results - two studies found primate populations increased in China and The Gambia, while two studies in Thailand and Malaysia found populations declined after regular provision (action 1526). Three studies found majority survival rates with continuous feeding, and one study in Liberia found majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (action 1526). Supplementary feeding only during resource scarce periods demonstrated positive survival outcomes - one study found majority of chimpanzees survived for at least five years in Republic of Congo, one study found wild olive baboons survived for at least 17 years after drought-period feeding in Kenya, and one study in Madagascar found black-and-white ruffed lemurs maintained similar diets to wild individuals (action 1527). Temporary supplementary feeding showed variable results - one study in Tanzania found chimpanzee population increased after two months of feeding, but one study in Brazil found golden lion tamarin population declined after one year. Four studies found only minority survival rates for reintroduced primates, while other studies found majority survival rates ranging from 27 months in Guinea to four years in Republic of Congo (action 1528). Social feeding approaches showed that monkeys completed enrichment tasks faster when fed in social groups compared to feeding alone, and ate more unfamiliar foods when groupmates were present (action 1343). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of establishing prey populations as a supplementary feeding strategy (action 1529). Prohibition of feeding showed that Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning (action 1502).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For benefits, one study found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys that were translocated survived and remained at release sites for at least four years (Action 1422). Additionally, crop-raiding olive baboons translocated from farmland had similar survival rates to non-translocated populations after 16 years (Action 1422).

However, there are significant drawbacks. No direct evidence exists for the effects of relocating primates to non-residential areas on primate populations (Action 1423). Studies of mammal translocation more broadly show concerning patterns: translocated grizzly bears had lower survival rates than non-translocated bears (Action 2336), fewer than half of translocated black bears survived after one year (Action 2336), and translocated crop-raiding African elephants had lower survival rates than non-translocated elephants (Action 2485). Additionally, many translocated mammals return to their original locations or continue causing problems - at least some brown/grizzly and black bears returned to their capture locations and/or continued causing nuisance after translocation (Actions 2336, 2341), and leopards translocated away from human areas attacked more humans and livestock than before translocation (Action 2336).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Implementing a 'no-feeding of wild primates' policy showed effectiveness, with one controlled, before-and-after study in Japan finding that several previously increasing Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning (Action 1502). Putting up signs to warn people about not feeding primates also demonstrated benefits, with one review in Japan finding that aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans declined after prohibiting tourists from feeding of monkeys (Action 1507). Other available management actions include not allowing people to consume food within natural areas where primates can view them (Action 1508), installing 'primate-proof' garbage bins (Action 1505), removing human food waste that may potentially serve as food sources for primates to avoid disease transmission and conflict with humans (Action 1561), and installing mechanical barriers to deter primates such as fences and ditches (Action 1436). However, for these latter actions, no evidence was found for their effects on primate populations during systematic searches. Diversionary feeding approaches have been tested for mammals generally, with two before-and-after studies in the USA finding that diversionary feeding reduced nuisance behaviour by black bears (Action 2323), though specific evidence for primates was not found.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence base for actions to mitigate the impacts of the mining industry on primate populations?\nanswer: The evidence base for actions to mitigate the impacts of the mining industry on primate populations shows a significant lack of scientific studies. Specific mining-related conservation actions for primates have no evidence supporting their effectiveness. These include using 'set-aside' areas of natural habitat for primate protection within mining areas (Action 1453), minimizing ground vibrations caused by open cast mining activities (Action 1451), implementing a minimum number of roads needed to reach mining extraction sites (Action 1462), certifying mines and marketing their products as 'primate friendly' (Action 1454), and establishing no-mining zones in/near watersheds to preserve water levels and water quality (Action 1452). For each of these actions, no studies have been found that directly and quantitatively tested these interventions during systematic journal and report searches, making it impossible to assess whether they are effective or have harmful impacts. The only evidence found for post-extraction habitat restoration (Action 3862) relates to butterflies and moths after mining and quarrying, with studies from the Czech Republic, UK and New Zealand showing mixed results for restored versus naturally recovering sites, but contains no evidence specific to primates. One study on reducing surface feature size during extraction (Action 3845) found that narrow corridors used for oil prospecting had lower butterfly species richness and abundance than wide corridors but were similar to undisturbed forest, though again this provides no evidence for primate populations.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective actions for improving habitat connectivity for primates in fragmented agricultural and urban landscapes?\nanswer: Based on the action documents reviewed, there is limited evidence specifically evaluating habitat connectivity actions for primates in fragmented landscapes. The most promising evidence comes from Action 1581, which found that black howler monkey numbers increased by 138% over 13 years after the protection of forest along property boundaries and across cleared areas in Belize. Action 1580 similarly found that black howler monkey numbers increased by 138% over 13 years after the protection of a forest corridor alongside other interventions. Action 1457 provides evidence that pole bridges can be effective connectivity structures, with studies showing that black lion tamarins and capuchins used a pole bridge to cross a road in Brazil, black howler monkey populations increased after construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps in Belize, and all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines in Madagascar. However, many potentially relevant actions lack evidence: no studies were found evaluating the effects of maintaining/restoring habitat connectivity on farmland (Action 2381), creating natural habitat islands within agricultural land (Action 1425), using fences as biological corridors (Action 1426), installing green bridges (Action 1456), incorporating forested corridors into logged areas (Action 1495), or restoring habitat corridors (Action 1583) specifically on primate populations.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Following captive breeding and reintroduction, over what timeframes have primate survival and population changes been documented?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, primate survival and population changes following captive breeding and reintroduction have been documented across varying timeframes. Short-term monitoring has documented survival for periods as brief as two months (Action 1589, 1591) and up to four months (Action 1596). Medium-term studies have tracked survival for fifteen weeks to seven years (Action 1567, 1591), with specific periods including nine months to four years for western lowland gorillas (Action 1595), and two to thirty months for various primate species (Action 1567, 1590). Long-term population monitoring has documented persistence and changes over four to five years for multiple species including rhesus monkeys and black lion tamarins (Action 1567, 1590), over seven years for golden lion tamarins (Action 1594), up to twelve years for some primates (Action 1590), and extended periods of 25 years for chimpanzee populations (Action 1567, 1590) and 33 years for orangutan populations (Action 1591).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To improve the effectiveness of anti-poaching patrols for primate conservation, what are the documented outcomes of providing better equipment versus providing training?\nanswer: The documented outcomes show similar positive results for both providing better equipment and training to anti-poaching patrols, though both approaches were typically implemented alongside other interventions. For equipment provision (Action 1476): one study in Uganda found that no gorillas were killed for 21 months after game guards were provided with better equipment, one before-and-after study in Rwanda found that the number of immature gorillas increased and the number of snares decreased after anti-poaching patrols were supplied with better equipment, and one before-and-after study in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda found that gorilla populations increased after anti-poaching guards were provided with better equipment. For training provision (Action 1477): one study in Uganda found that no gorillas were killed over 21 months after game guards received training, one before-and-after study in Rwanda found that the number of immature gorillas increased in areas where game guards received training, one before-and-after study in India found that a population of hoolock gibbons increased after sanctuary staff received training, and one before-and-after study in Cameroon found that no incidents of primate poaching occurred over a three year period after anti-poaching rangers were trained.

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the comparative outcomes of providing primates with continuous supplementary food versus providing it only during scarce periods or for a limited time?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, different supplementary feeding strategies for primates show varying outcomes. Continuous supplementary feeding shows mixed results: two studies in China and The Gambia found population increases after regular provision of supplementary food, while two studies in Thailand and Malaysia found population declines (Action 1526). Three studies in Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia found that the majority of primates survived with continuous feeding, and one study in Liberia found that the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (Action 1526). However, one controlled study in Madagascar found that continuously fed black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed different diets compared to wild groups (Action 1526). \n\nFeeding during resource scarce periods only appears to show more positive outcomes: studies found that the majority of chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo survived for at least five years, wild olive baboons in Kenya survived for at least 17 years after drought period feeding, and black-and-white ruffed lemurs in Madagascar maintained diets similar to wild individuals (Action 1527).\n\nLimited-time feeding strategies show variable results: one study in Tanzania found population increases after two months of supplementary feeding following reintroduction, while one study in Brazil found population decline after one year of feeding (Action 1528). Four studies found that only a minority of reintroduced primates survived after limited supplementary feeding, though three studies in Gabon, South Africa and Vietnam found that a majority of primates survived reintroduction with supplementary feeding (Action 1528). Additionally, one controlled study in Japan found that Japanese macaque populations declined in size and productivity after limiting and then prohibiting food provisioning (Action 1502).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
