For solitary bees, 29 out of 30 replicated trials showed occupancy by bees, with many species readily using nest boxes including endangered species. Occupancy rates for solitary bee nest boxes ranged from 1-26% of available cavities, and studies demonstrated that nest provision could double the number of occupied nests over three years. In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes showed very low uptake rates of 2% or less in recent UK trials, with only 0-2.5% occupancy in three replicated trials since 1989. While some older trials (pre-1978) showed higher bumblebee occupancy rates of 10-48%, current evidence indicates underground nest boxes are most effective for bumblebees with 6-58% occupancy, whereas surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for gardens show very low success rates of 0-1.5%.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For forest replanting and native vegetation restoration (Action 3933), studies show mixed results for butterflies and moths - with five studies finding similar species richness or diversity of butterflies and flower-visiting insects in replanted areas compared to remnant forests, prairies, and naturally regenerating areas, but some studies also finding lower butterfly species richness and abundance in replanted areas compared to remnant native habitat. One large replicated controlled trial (Action 362) found that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square. For habitat restoration along watercourses (Action 1408), one replicated, paired site comparison found similar numbers of bees and bee species, but different bee communities, in restored and remnant sites, with bee visitation rates to native flowers not differing between restored and remnant sites. Studies examining habitat corridors (Actions 1580, 1730, 2576) provide very limited evidence for bees specifically, with no studies directly testing corridors for bee conservation. One study in Indonesia (Action 1730) found that a peat swamp forest corridor contained substantial tree density but did not assess bee populations. For increasing natural or semi-natural habitat in farmed landscapes (Action 6), no evidence was found demonstrating effects on bee diversity or abundance. Similarly, increasing landscape diversity of nectar and pollen plants (Action 21) has limited evidence showing positive correlation with long-tongued bumblebee abundance.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

These include nest boxes made from cut hollow stems or tubes, blocks of wood drilled with holes, and wooden boxes. Optimal placement is within 150-600 m of foraging resources (action ID: 80), with reed stem and wooden grooved-board designs being most productive (action ID: 47). For ground-nesting bees, creating artificial patches of bare ground has shown success in colonization by ground-nesting solitary bees and wasps within the first or second year (action ID: 13). For bumblebees, underground nest boxes buried 5-10 cm below ground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes are most effective, achieving 6-58% occupancy rates, compared to wooden surface nest boxes which showed very low uptake (0-1.5%) in recent trials (action ID: 48).

Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits, with fourteen trials demonstrating wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly phacelia which attracted 8-35 bee species across studies. Hedgerow management significantly benefits wild bees, with five replicated studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to those without, along with enhanced crop visitation rates by native bees in fields adjacent to planted hedgerows. Organic farming systems show mixed but potentially positive results, with three replicated trials demonstrating higher wild bee abundance under organic arable farming compared to conventional methods. Agri-environment schemes have demonstrated enhanced wild bee diversity and abundance in four replicated trials across Europe, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic farming options, Dutch meadow bird agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship schemes. Other beneficial practices include reducing tillage intensity, with one study finding three times more squash bees on no-till farms, and reducing meadow management intensity with two trials showing enhanced bee diversity on extensively managed meadows with delayed cutting and reduced agrochemical use.

Planting hedgerows (actions 1407, 2515) is effective, with five replicated studies finding more bee species in fields with hedgerows compared to fields without hedgerows. Leaving unharvested crop headlands (action 3924) can provide floral resources, with one study finding higher abundance and species richness of butterflies in unharvested alfalfa headlands compared to harvested crops.

Repeated nest box provision at sites over three years can double the number of occupied solitary bee nests.

The most consistently effective approach is providing artificial nest sites using specific materials and designs. Studies across 10 countries demonstrate that solitary bees readily occupy nest boxes made from cut hollow stems or tubes (23 replicated trials) and blocks of wood drilled with holes (11 replicated trials), with 29 out of 30 trials showing occupancy by bees, including endangered species. Reed stems and wooden grooved-board designs were found to be particularly productive, while plastic-lined holes and paper or plastic tubes had lower success due to parasitism and mold issues. For bumblebees, underground nest boxes proved most effective, with seven replicated trials showing 6-58% occupancy for boxes buried 5-10 cm underground with 30-80 cm entrance pipes, compared to very low uptake (0-2.5%) for surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening. However, nest boxes for stingless bees showed no uptake in one Brazilian trial. Protecting existing nesting sites is also important - excluding ants from solitary bee nests increased offspring production, and using sticky barriers to exclude introduced European earwigs significantly increased native bee use of nest boxes.

At the local patch scale, multiple replicated trials demonstrate that planted flower patches consistently attract substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with studies documenting 8-35 bee species on such patches. Field margins sown with wild flowers or agricultural nectar and pollen mixes support significantly higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated strips. However, at the wider landscape scale, the evidence is more mixed. One large replicated trial found positive correlation between long-tongued bumblebee abundance and the number of pollen/nectar agreements in 10 km grid squares, but other trials show that bee numbers and species richness are not significantly higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches. Additionally, two replicated trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the landscape scale.
