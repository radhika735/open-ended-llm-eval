Rotational mowing (mowing strips in alternate years or leaving some areas uncut) can increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to annual complete mowing. Delaying cutting dates to July or September rather than May/June can increase butterfly abundance. Changing mowing regimes (such as mowing in August vs November) can maintain caterpillar populations. Grazing management shows mixed results - intensive grazing generally reduces butterfly abundance compared to light or no grazing, while traditional low-intensity grazing can be beneficial. Mechanical removal of mid-storey or ground vegetation and herbicide application are additional alternatives, though evidence for their effectiveness specifically for butterflies is limited. Maintaining species-rich semi-natural grasslands through extensive management (light grazing or annual mowing) can support butterfly communities.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Retaining connectivity between habitat patches helps butterfly populations persist, with well-connected low quality habitat patches more likely to retain Alcon large blue populations than less well connected patches. Habitat corridors also facilitate movement, as common buckeye butterflies were more likely to colonize distant habitat patches when released on corridors of suitable habitat. Restoring or creating habitat connectivity has been shown to increase the abundance of multiple butterfly species, including Karner blue, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, marsh fritillary, and regal fritillary butterflies. Connected habitat patches also promote movement between patches, with common buckeye and variegated fritillary butterflies more likely to move between connected than unconnected patches.

Key techniques include: 1) Rotational mowing - cutting strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut increases butterfly and burnet moth abundance compared to annual complete mowing, with two heath fritillary populations surviving on rotationally mown grasslands while six went extinct on unmanaged grasslands; 2) Delayed cutting - mowing grassland once in July instead of May/June increases butterfly abundance and species richness, with September cutting maintaining stable scarce large blue butterfly populations while May mowing led to decreases over time; 3) Reducing fertilizer and chemical inputs - unfertilized UK grasslands support greater species richness of specialist moths and similar abundance of adult butterflies compared to fertilized grasslands; 4) Altering mowing regimes on road verges and greenspaces - less frequent mowing or leaving areas unmown increases butterfly species richness and abundance compared to regularly mown areas. These findings are supported by evidence that 24 out of 58 moth species prefer less intensively managed UK grasslands, and reducing grazing combined with stopping chemical applications increased both species richness and total abundance of large moths.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Five of eight replicated studies in the UK, Sweden, Germany, USA and Switzerland found that grasslands grazed with lower stocking densities of sheep, cattle or mixed livestock had greater species richness of adult butterflies, all moths and burnet moths compared to higher stocking densities (Action 3959).\n\nSeasonal removal of livestock also shows benefits for butterfly richness. Two of three controlled studies in the UK found that grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed during summer months had similar or greater species richness of butterflies compared to continuously grazed grasslands (Action 3960).\n\nRotational grazing demonstrates positive effects with two of four studies in France and USA finding that rotationally grazed grasslands had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than continuously grazed grasslands, though results varied by stocking density and study duration (Action 3965).\n\nChanging livestock type can also benefit butterfly richness, with studies in Sweden and France finding that semi-natural grasslands grazed by cattle or horses had greater species richness of butterflies and burnet moths than sheep-grazed grasslands (Action 3963).\n\nConversely, increasing grazing intensity or cutting frequency generally shows negative effects, with studies finding lower species richness and abundance of butterflies in intensively grazed sites compared to low or no grazing (Action 3962).\n\nCeasing grazing entirely produces mixed results - some studies show increased butterfly richness after 4-10 years of abandonment, while others show similar or reduced richness compared to grazed grasslands (Action 3956).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Beyond sowing wildflower mixes, what alternative management practices for field margins and headlands have been shown to benefit butterfly populations on UK farmland?\nanswer: Research has shown several alternative management practices for field margins and headlands that benefit butterfly populations on UK farmland beyond sowing wildflower mixes. Conservation headlands (leaving headlands unsprayed) have been shown to increase both butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands, with studies finding greater species richness of butterflies and higher abundance of butterflies and caterpillars in unsprayed headlands. Hedgerow management practices, including planting new hedges and managing existing hedgerows for wildlife, have demonstrated significant benefits. Planting new hedges has been found to result in higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths compared to crops or pasture, with higher abundance of butterflies, moths and gatekeepers along hedgerows. Managing hedgerows through cutting regimes (cutting once every 2-3 years or in autumn rather than winter) has shown higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, with hedgerows containing trees supporting higher butterfly abundance than simple hedgerows. Creating uncultivated margins around fields has shown benefits including higher species richness of butterflies in longer or wider margins and higher abundance of butterflies compared to cereal fields. Grass buffer strips planted around fields have been found effective when they are wider (up to 6m wide), with floristically enhanced grass buffers showing greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than standard grass margins. Leaving uncropped, cultivated margins can increase butterfly abundance in some species, while buffer strips to reduce pesticide run-off have been shown to increase moth abundance compared to conventionally managed margins.

Specific findings include: unsprayed field headlands had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than sprayed headlands; organic farms generally had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies, burnet moths, and macro-moths compared to conventional farms (though some studies found no difference or effects were limited to certain landscape contexts); and arable margins not sprayed with herbicide glyphosate had greater species richness and butterfly abundance than sprayed margins. The positive effects varied by species, with some moths showing preferences for unfertilized grasslands while others preferred fertilized areas.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Prairies managed by haying had higher abundance of prairie specialist butterflies but lower abundance of generalist and migrant butterflies compared to burned prairies. The abundance of prairie specialists was higher in the first year after haying than in the second year, and Karner blue butterflies showed similar abundance on mowed and burned savannas.\n\nPrescribed burning shows varied effects on different butterfly species. Some studies found higher abundance of heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender's blue caterpillars and eggs on burned lands compared to unburned or grazed areas, while other studies found lower abundance of Brenton blue butterfly eggs and adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, and regal fritillary adults on burned lands. Prairies managed by burning had lower abundance of prairie specialists like regal fritillary and arogos skipper compared to hayed prairies, but higher abundance of generalist and migrant species.\n\nRotational mowing appears beneficial for butterfly communities. Studies found greater species richness and abundance of butterflies in grasslands managed with rotational mowing techniques compared to complete annual mowing. European reviews indicated that rotationally mowing grassland benefitted 27 out of 67 butterfly species of conservation concern.\n\nMechanical cutting/scrub clearing shows positive effects, with studies finding higher abundance of Karner blue butterflies on mechanically cut pine barrens compared to rotationally burned areas, and higher species richness and abundance of butterflies under power lines managed by mechanical cutting compared to unmanaged land.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
