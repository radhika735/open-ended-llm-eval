One before-and-after study in the Pacific Ocean found that involving fishers and stakeholders in co-management did not decrease overall fishing effort after five years (Action ID: 2910). Similarly, territorial fishing use rights also showed no decrease in fishing effort over five years (Action ID: 2677). However, overall catch limits (quota caps) showed some success, with a North Sea study finding that when annual total allowable catch limits were changed, half of the otter trawl fleet had corresponding changes in fishing effort (Action ID: 3811). Long-term fishery closures showed more positive results, with a replicated, controlled, before-and-after study in the North Sea finding that long-term closure of a commercial fishery reduced overall fishing effort for lesser sandeel (Action ID: 2655). Temporary closures showed limited effectiveness, with one North Sea study finding that fixed temporary closures had little effect on fishing effort for cod, though real-time area closures reduced the annual amount of cod caught (Action ID: 2664).

Setting minimum landing sizes (Action 2735) allows fish to reach maturity and spawn before being caught, though evidence shows mixed effectiveness - one study reported only one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after minimum sizes were set, while another found most landed fish were still immature despite established minimum sizes. Protecting spawning fish from capture through seasonal closures (Action 2938) and temporary fishery closures (Action 2664) can provide protection during critical reproductive periods, with evidence showing cod spent nearly a third of their time in closed spawning areas during implementation. Marine protected areas that prohibit harvesting of specific species like conch (Action 2237) have shown increased abundance compared to fished areas. Size-based management approaches specifying capture size ranges (Action 2737) are also available, though no studies have evaluated their effectiveness.

Prohibiting all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom (demersal) species (Action 2654) showed mixed results: one study found higher numbers of larger and older cod after 15 years of closure, while another found no effect on fish densities after 2-7 years. Fish densities varied between species and were influenced by depth and temperature. Cod showed better growth in closed areas after 5-15 years compared to openly fished areas.\n\nProhibiting mobile fishing gears dragged across the seafloor (Action 2673) demonstrated more consistent positive effects across 10 studies. These included higher total fish biomass after 15 years, increased adult red mullet biomass after 14 years, improved recruitment of young red mullet, and larger sizes of adult red mullet. However, effects varied between individual fish groups and with habitat type. One study showed increased catch rates after 3-6 years of prohibiting beach and seine nets.\n\nProhibiting shellfish dredging (Action 2668) showed no effect on bottom-dwelling fish abundance or species richness after 10 years of closure.

In the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico, studies showed mixed results with some commercially targeted species showing higher abundance after protection while others showed no change. The Mediterranean Sea demonstrated varied responses with some species groups showing higher abundance after five years while others like white seabream showed no biomass increase. The Indian Ocean showed mixed effects with some fish groups having higher abundance and larger overall fish size in protected areas. The Tasman Sea region was notable for showing mostly decreased abundance or mixed results after fishing prohibition. The South China Sea showed conflicting results with decreased species richness but increased overall fish density in the wider region. The South Atlantic Ocean showed no significant differences in species composition or diversity after 40 years of protection.

Zonation systems allow different levels of fishing restrictions across different zones within the protected area, ranging from no-take zones to zones with partial fishing restrictions. Fishing activity can be restricted through various unspecified limitations rather than complete prohibition. Gear restrictions can be implemented, including limiting trap density, modifying trawl net configurations (such as mesh size, escape panels, twine types, and codend circumference), and restricting vessel size or engine power. Catch management tools include setting catch limits or quotas for targeted and non-targeted species, establishing minimum or maximum landing sizes, and creating move-on rules that trigger temporary area closures when catch thresholds are reached. Temporal restrictions can be applied such as establishing temporary fishery closures, allowing periodic fishing only during specific time periods, or implementing seasonal fishing restrictions. Recreational fishing and harvesting can be specifically limited or prohibited while allowing commercial fishing to continue. These management approaches have been shown to result in larger fish sizes, greater abundance and biomass of fish populations, and different age and sex structures compared to heavily fished areas, while still maintaining some level of fishing activity.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Size-sorting escape grids, when fitted to fish trawl nets, improved size-selection of haddock in some cases (Action 2720), while grids on prawn/shrimp trawls reduced unwanted undersized fish catches (Action 2721). Using square mesh codends combined with escape grids resulted in better size selection compared to standard configurations (Actions 2725, 2724).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study in the Adriatic Sea (Italy) found that a marine protected area zone allowing only artisanal fishing activity for three years had higher overall commercial catch rates of five of seven species compared to unprotected areas openly fished (Action 2678). In contrast, a study of prohibiting customary fishing in Papua New Guinea showed limited ecological benefits, with only one of seven fish species showing higher abundance after eight years of closure, though six of seven species showed lower flight response distance, potentially making them more vulnerable to spear gun capture (Action 2675). Community-based fisheries management in New Zealand showed positive outcomes for scallop populations, with customary fisheries areas having more New Zealand scallops compared to fully protected areas or areas allowing recreational harvest, though scallops tended to be smaller (Action 2242).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
