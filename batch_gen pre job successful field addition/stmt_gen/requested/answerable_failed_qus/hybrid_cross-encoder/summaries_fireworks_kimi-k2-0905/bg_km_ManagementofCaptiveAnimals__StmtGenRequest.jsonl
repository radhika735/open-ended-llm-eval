Providing live invertebrates reduced inactivity and increased foraging in captive loris to levels seen in wild loris (Action 1333). Providing cut branches (browse) allows captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage (Action 1332). Live vegetation in planters for foraging increased time spent foraging in chimpanzees compared to normal browse and grass (Action 1327). Changing feeding times to unpredictable schedules decreased inactivity in chimpanzees (Action 1338). Feeding individuals in social groups allows monkeys to complete enrichment tasks faster than when feeding alone and encourages them to eat more unfamiliar foods (Action 1343).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the potential benefits and negative impacts of using complex feeding devices, like puzzle feeders or prey simulators, for captive primates and carnivores?\nanswer: Evidence from several studies shows that complex feeding devices have both beneficial and negative impacts on captive primates and carnivores. For primates, puzzle feeders decreased food sharing, increased foraging behavior and tool use, but also increased aggression levels in some cases. Puzzle feeders also increased time spent feeding and reduced inactive time in primates. For carnivores, prey simulation devices including lures, pulleys and bungees increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, while decreasing pacing behavior and increasing walking in cougars, though tigers initially showed increased pacing when presented with carcasses on bungees. Alternative feeding methods like scattering food throughout enclosures increased exploratory behaviors and reduced abnormal behaviors and aggression in various primate species including chimpanzees and lemurs, while frozen food in ice decreased stereotypic behaviors and increased activity levels in bears and felids. These complex feeding interventions appear to generally enhance natural foraging behaviors and reduce inactivity, though some implementations may initially increase stress behaviors like pacing or aggression in certain individuals.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For primates, one replicated, controlled study found that when chimpanzees were fed on unpredictable schedules, their inactivity decreased (Action 1338). For carnivores, multiple studies demonstrate benefits of unpredictable feeding schedules: three replicated studies found that random temporal feeding reduced stereotypic pacing behaviors in tigers and cheetahs (Action 1904), and two studies found increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats with unpredictable schedules (Action 1904). However, effects vary by species, as one study found that unpredictable feeding increased territorial behavior in coyotes but did not affect traveling or foraging (Action 1904). Regarding feeding frequency, one study found that large felids fed once every three days paced more frequently on non-feeding days (Action 1906). Presenting feeds during different crowd levels also showed effects, with one study finding that chimpanzees increased foraging and object use when smaller crowds were present (Action 1324).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Providing fresh produce instead of pellet feed increased feeding time and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques (Action ID: 1335). Presenting food items whole rather than processed increased consumption and feeding time in macaques (Action ID: 1323). Formulating diets to reflect the nutritional composition of wild foods, including removing domestic fruits, decreased regurgitation and reingestion in gorillas and reduced aggression and self-directed behavior in lemurs (Action ID: 1329). Providing cut branches (browse) allowed captive gorillas to use the same processing skills as wild gorillas when foraging on stinging nettles (Action ID: 1332). Scattering food throughout enclosures increased feeding and exploratory behaviors while reducing abnormal behaviors and aggression across multiple primate species including rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, lemurs, and gorillas (Action ID: 1315). Hiding food in containers combined with browse increased activity levels and foraging behaviors in lemurs and gibbons (Action ID: 1316). Providing live vegetation in planters led chimpanzees to spend more time foraging compared to normal feeding methods (Action ID: 1327).

Temperature variation is used, with one study showing breeding occurred following a temperature drop from 20-24\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C (action 1864). Artificial rainfall simulation has proven effective, with studies in Germany and Austria demonstrating that simulating wet and dry seasons stimulated breeding and egg deposition (action 1872). Lighting variation is another approach, involving changes in UV percentage or gradients to simulate seasonal light changes, though one UK study found no difference in clutch size from UV boost treatments (action 1865). Pre-breeding cooling periods combined with other husbandry practices like allowing females to gain weight before breeding, separating sexes during non-breeding periods, providing mate choice, and playing recorded mating calls have been shown to increase breeding success (action 1864). Enclosure modifications including providing multiple egg laying sites, calling sites, breeding areas, and various substrates (including rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes) also support breeding behavior (actions 1873, 1876).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Social group feeding (Action 1343) appears to enhance feeding efficiency, with monkeys completing enrichment tasks faster when in social groups versus feeding alone, and encourages dietary exploration, as monkeys consumed more unfamiliar foods when in the presence of their groupmates. Scattering food throughout the enclosure (Action 1315) reduces aggression and abnormal behaviors while increasing natural foraging behaviors in multiple primate species including rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, lemurs, and gorillas. Feeding in the presence of smaller crowds (Action 1324) increases natural foraging and object use behaviors in chimpanzees. However, separate individual feeding (Action 1342) and subgroup feeding (Action 1344) have not been systematically studied, leaving their trade-offs undocumented. The choice of feeding strategy appears to significantly impact both behavioral welfare and social dynamics, with social feeding generally promoting more efficient feeding and food exploration, while distributed feeding approaches like scattering appear to reduce competition-related problems.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

These include providing specific enclosure furniture such as rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes, and varied substrates to create calling sites and breeding areas [1876]. Simulating seasonal changes through temperature variation (dropping from 20-24\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C) has been shown to stimulate breeding [1864], as has varying artificial rainfall to simulate wet and dry seasons [1872]. Managing social dynamics through allowing female mate choice [1882], separating sexes during non-breeding periods [1880], and playing recorded breeding calls to simulate the breeding season [1881] are also effective strategies. Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target critically endangered species has proven beneficial [1862]. Hormonal treatments can also be used to induce sperm and egg release, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment [883]. A combined approach incorporating multiple factors - such as pre-breeding cooling periods, allowing females to gain weight before breeding, providing mate choice, playing recorded calls, and using enclosures with proper furniture and flowing water - has shown increased breeding success and larger clutch sizes [1864, 1882, 1880, 1881].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
