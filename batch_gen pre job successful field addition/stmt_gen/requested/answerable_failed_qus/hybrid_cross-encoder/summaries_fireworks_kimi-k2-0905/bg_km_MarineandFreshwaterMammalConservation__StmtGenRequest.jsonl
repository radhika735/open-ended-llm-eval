[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions can be taken to reduce predation by marine mammals at aquaculture systems?\nanswer: Based on the evidence found, several actions can be taken to reduce predation by marine mammals at aquaculture systems. Replacing anti-predator nets more frequently at salmon farms resulted in fewer salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action ID: 2774). Using acoustic devices at aquaculture systems was effective in some studies - four out of six studies found that acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages (action ID: 2775). However, translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems was not effective, as two studies found that more than half or nearly all of Australian and New Zealand fur seals translocated away from salmon farms returned (action ID: 2776). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of modifying aquaculture gear (action ID: 2742), modifying anti-predator nets (action ID: 2743), minimizing food waste (action ID: 2744), introducing regulations to prevent harmful deterrents (action ID: 2746), or introducing legislation to prevent intentional killing of mammals (action ID: 2745) at aquaculture systems.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which modifications to fishing gear are most effective at reducing marine mammal entanglement?\nanswer: Evidence from action documents shows that deploying fishing nets at different depths is effective at reducing marine mammal entanglements. One controlled study in the Arafura Sea found that fishing nets deployed 4.5 m below the water surface had fewer entanglements of dolphins than surface nets (Action 2793). Using acoustically reflective fishing gear materials can also reduce entanglements - two of three controlled studies found that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets, although one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements (Action 2807). The use of weakened fishing gear has not been evaluated in studies for marine mammal populations (Action 2797). Other gear modifications such as establishing move-on rules for fishing vessels when mammals are encountered can reduce marine mammal mortality - a before-and-after study in the Great Australian Bight found that introducing measures to delay or relocate fishing if dolphins were encountered resulted in fewer short-beaked common dolphins being encircled and killed (Action 2790).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For habitat protection specifically, four studies found mixed but generally positive effects: Mediterranean monk seal populations increased after eight years of island protection, bottlenose dolphin populations maintained similar sizes before and after habitat protection, Hector's dolphins showed higher survival rates after coastal area protection, and human-caused strandings decreased while overall strandings remained similar after area protection. For hunting prohibitions, four of five studies found that abundance increased after hunting bans: harbour seals and humpback whales increased over 7-30 years, and 10 of 12 baleen whale populations showed significant increases during 7-21 years after protective legislation.

Only one intervention type has been evaluated in any studies: setting and enforcing vessel speed limits. Two before-and-after studies examined this intervention - one in the Indian River estuarine system (USA) and one in the North Atlantic Ocean (USA). The Indian River study found similar numbers of manatee deaths before and after vessel speed limits were set in 'zones', but fewer deaths after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. The North Atlantic study found that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions.

More than a quarter of translocated seals reproduced, and they exhibited similar dispersal behavior to native-born pups.

Twenty-one studies with post-release monitoring found that 10-100% of dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, sea lions and manatees survived after being released following rehabilitation, with monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years. One controlled study found that at least 25% of California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning and released back into the wild died or had to be euthanized. Reproductive success was demonstrated by one study showing that more than 25% of rehabilitated and released Hawaiian monk seals reproduced. Eleven studies on rescue and release of stranded or trapped marine mammals found survival rates of 17-100% during post-release monitoring periods ranging from three weeks to three years. These studies included evidence that rescued and released common bottlenose dolphins were observed with calves one year later, and that Hawaiian monk seal rescue and release, along with other interventions, resulted in more than 25% of the seals surviving and reproducing. Behavioural evidence from three controlled studies showed that rehabilitated and released harbour porpoises and harbour seals had similar movements and behaviours to wild mammals in two of the studies, while one study found that California sea lions treated for toxic algae poisoning showed altered behavior compared to wild sea lions.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Anti-predator nets around aquaculture systems can be replaced or repaired more frequently to reduce salmon losses to harbour seal predation (action ID 2774).

Translocating mammals away from aquaculture systems has been attempted, but studies found that more than half or nearly all of translocated Australian and New Zealand fur seals returned (action ID 2776).

The most effective approaches include:\n\nAcoustic devices have shown significant promise across multiple studies. Deploying acoustic devices on moorings (Action 2816) reduced the number of harbour seals feeding on migrating juvenile salmon in the Puntledge River in Canada. At aquaculture systems (Action 2775), acoustic devices reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals, and South American sea lions. Using acoustic devices on fishing gear (Action 2808) reduced seal damage to fish catches and fishing nets in multiple controlled studies.\n\nPhysical gear modifications have also proven effective. Modifying fishing pots and traps to exclude mammals (Action 2822) with wire grids or steel bars, along with strengthened netting, reduced damage to salmon catches by grey and harbour seals. Installing steel rods or metal frames on fishing pots and traps also reduced the number of grey and harbour seals that entered or became trapped in pots.\n\nElectric deterrents showed positive results in one controlled study (Action 2818), where using an electric current on a fishing net reduced Pacific harbour seal predation on salmon catches.\n\nLess effective methods included switching off artificial lighting at wild fisheries (Action 2825) and installing cork line barriers (Action 2824), both of which failed to deter harbour seals from feeding on salmon released from a hatchery. Playing predator calls (Action 2817) was ineffective at deterring Cape fur seals.
