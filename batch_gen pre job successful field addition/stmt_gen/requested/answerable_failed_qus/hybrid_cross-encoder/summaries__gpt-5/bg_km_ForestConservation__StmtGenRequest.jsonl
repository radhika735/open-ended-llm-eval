Evidence gaps include: no studies found on the effects of restricting pedestrian access on vegetation in marshes or swamps [3022]; no studies found on using voluntary agreements with locals to reduce disturbance for mammals [2339]; and no evidence on the effects of prohibiting food consumption where primates can view people [1508]. Tourism-related evidence includes two studies on reptile-focused eco-tourism reporting self-reported human behaviour changes (participants indicating they would have searched for nesting turtles without supervised tours, or increased conscientiousness about behaviours affecting sea turtles) [3680].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing to protect forests vary across different geographical locations mentioned in the evidence?\nanswer: Across locations, effects vary: Preventing livestock grazing increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants in Brazil, the UK and Costa Rica, with one study reporting mixed effects; in Israel, preventing cattle grazing increased oak seedling and sapling density (1206). Excluding livestock with wire fences increased understory biomass, species richness, density and cover in some studies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA, while other studies in these regions found mixed or no effects; in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama, fencing increased the size, density and number of regenerating trees, though one study reported decreased tree density without a change in tree size (1205). Shortening the grazing period increased abundance and size of regenerating oak in Spain, had no effect on native plant species richness in Australia, and in the UK resulted in higher numbers of tree seedlings after summer than winter grazing (1208). Reducing grazing intensity increased tree saplings in the UK and increased understory biomass in Greece (1207).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What management techniques involving tree removal can be used to increase forest structural diversity and what are their effects?\nanswer: Evidence-based, tree-removal techniques include: group-selection harvesting, general logging/removal, partial retention harvesting, and clearcutting. Group-selection harvesting increased understory plant cover and diversity and the density of young trees in multiple studies, though some studies reported decreases or no effects on understory metrics and tree density/growth-rate [1224]. General logging/removal increased understory plant density and cover in about half of studies and increased understory species richness/diversity in several studies, while other studies found no or mixed effects [1273]; it increased young tree density in one replicated controlled study and showed mixed effects in another [1272]; for mature trees, logging decreased tree density/cover in some studies, increased density in others, had mixed effects on tree size (increases in several studies; decreases or no effect in others), and showed mixed effects on tree species richness/diversity, with decreases in some studies and increases or no effect in others [1271]; among non-vascular plants, logging decreased epiphyte abundance and fern fertility in two of three studies, with species-specific mixed effects reported elsewhere [1270]. Partial retention harvesting (vs clearcutting) decreased the density of young trees in three Canadian studies [1215]. Clearcutting increased understory plant cover and species richness in most of the studies reviewed, but reduced density, species richness, and diversity of mature trees in some studies; effects on young tree density/species richness were mixed across studies [1222].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
