Several moderators were reported: shore level did not affect species richness in some studies, pool depth often had no effect, tilted pools had higher richness than horizontal ones, and adding short flexible habitats had mixed effects depending on species group and site [3476]. A before-and-after study reported that creating pools alongside reducing structure slope increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness on the structure [3476]. One study reported that creating rock pools did not increase fish species richness on and around the structure [3476].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating small groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) sometimes increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity and abundance, and altered or supported distinct communities and fish communities (often alongside pits), but multiple studies reported no increases in richness or abundance for macroalgae or invertebrates, and fish richness/abundance responses ranged from increases (with pits) to no change; grooves often supported species absent from ungrooved surfaces and were used by mussels and periwinkles (3473). Creating combinations of grooves with small protrusions/ridges/ledges (1\u201350 mm) often altered community composition and sometimes increased combined macroalgae\u2013invertebrate richness/diversity and abundance, though many studies found mixed or no effects depending on groove/ridge size, arrangement, shore level, covers, or site; invertebrate abundances showed mixed responses with some increases (e.g., oysters) and fish abundances generally did not increase, while fish feeding or interaction behavior sometimes changed (3474).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What conservation actions for artificial structures have been studied in estuaries in Australia, and what were the outcomes?\nanswer: In estuaries in southeast Australia, studies on intertidal structures reported that reducing structure slope (often alongside adding rock pools) increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness, but did not increase macroalgal, oyster or mobile invertebrate abundance [3461]. Transplanting or seeding biota onto intertidal structures (including oysters and coralline algae) supported species otherwise absent and had mixed effects on combined richness/diversity and invertebrate abundance, while generally not increasing fish richness or abundance; mobile invertebrate richness increased in one Australian study [3472]. Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) on intertidal structures altered combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate community composition, decreased combined species richness at low tide, and showed mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances; fish richness and abundance at high tide did not increase [3459]. Creating pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) on intertidal structures altered community composition in some studies, sometimes supported species absent from flat surfaces, and showed mixed effects on combined richness and invertebrate abundances across sites and designs, including in Australian estuaries [3475]. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on intertidal structures, often alongside other features, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate richness/diversity, supported species absent from flat surfaces, and did not consistently increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance; added holes and pools were used by sea slugs, urchins and octopuses in Australia [3467]. Using environmentally\u2011sensitive materials on intertidal structures (e.g., sandstone vs basalt, modified concretes, ECOncrete with grooves/ledges/holes) sometimes altered community composition and increased richness/diversity and overall cover, but effects on algal and invertebrate abundances were mixed across materials and sites, including an Australian estuary [3469]. On subtidal structures in Australian estuaries, creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) supported species absent from bare surfaces and showed mixed effects on fish richness and on mobile and non\u2011mobile invertebrate abundances [3451]. Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) on subtidal structures produced mixed effects on invertebrate community composition and abundances, and mixed effects on seahorse abundance, with no increase in invertebrate richness in a paired study [3450]. Transplanting or seeding onto subtidal structures included an Australian study where transplanted sea urchins reduced the cover of a non\u2011native sea mat on kelps; transplanted urchins survived [3471]. Using environmentally\u2011sensitive materials on subtidal structures (e.g., quarried rock, shell\u2011concrete, ECOncrete with added texture/holes/grooves/pits) sometimes altered community composition and increased richness/diversity, with mixed effects on macroalgal and invertebrate abundances across materials and locations that included Australian estuaries [3470].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general effects of creating linear habitat features, such as grooves, ridges or ledges, on intertidal artificial structures?\nanswer: Across multiple studies, adding linear habitat features to intertidal artificial structures produced mixed but often positive changes to community composition and biodiversity. Groove habitats and small ridges/ledges sometimes altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, and in several cases supported species absent from unmodified surfaces [3474, 3473]. Species richness/diversity often increased with grooves and small ridges/ledges, though effects were mixed and context\u2011dependent; grooves frequently supported higher richness than adjacent small ridges/ledges [3474, 3464, 3473]. Large ledges, when added alongside grooves and small protrusions, increased combined macroalgae, microalgae and invertebrate diversity and abundance, and increased rockweed abundance; large ridges did not consistently raise richness [3465]. Invertebrate abundances showed mixed responses overall, with some increases for oysters and mussels in certain designs, but not for barnacles or mobile invertebrates in others; grooves often matched or exceeded small ledges for mobile invertebrates and oysters [3474, 3465, 3473, 3464]. Fish richness and abundance typically did not increase with grooves or small ledges, although responses varied by site; behavioral changes were observed, including more benthic interaction near small ledges and increased juvenile salmon feeding where large ledges and grooves were installed [3474, 3473, 3465].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Creating large protrusions (>50 mm) led one study to report different community composition between angled vs horizontal protrusions and that protrusions supported species absent from flat surfaces [3463]. Creating small adjoining cavities or \u2018swimthrough\u2019 habitats (\u2264100 mm) did not alter the mobile invertebrate community composition in one replicated, controlled study [3468].
