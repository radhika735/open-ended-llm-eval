[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the population-level effects of legally protecting marine mammal species or their habitats?\nanswer: Evidence from four studies on legally protecting habitat reports mixed population-level outcomes: Mediterranean monk seal abundance increased over eight years after island habitats were protected, bottlenose dolphin population size was similar before and after partial range protection, Hector\u2019s dolphin survival rate was higher after coastal protection, and overall dolphin strandings were similar but human-caused strandings decreased after estuary protection (2915). No studies were found that directly evaluated population-level effects of legally protecting marine mammal species (2923) or of establishing networks of legally protected areas for these mammals (2913). Prohibiting or restricting hunting was associated with population increases in several cases: harbour seal and humpback whale abundance increased over 7\u201330 years in multiple regions, while numbers of mature male sperm whales showed no significant change; a review found significant increase rates for 10 of 12 baleen whale populations 7\u201321 years after anti-hunting legislation (2780). Prohibiting disturbance-causing activities in sensitive areas was linked to increased harbour porpoise activity at a stony reef after fishing was prohibited and the reef restored with boulders (2917).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
