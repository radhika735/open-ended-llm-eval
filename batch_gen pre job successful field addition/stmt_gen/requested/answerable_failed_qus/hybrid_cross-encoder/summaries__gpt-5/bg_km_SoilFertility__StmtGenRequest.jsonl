Controlled traffic showed mixed results for microbial metrics: one study found higher numbers and bacterial activity under controlled traffic, while another found higher microbial biomass when traffic was not controlled (899).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of amending soil with different types of organic materials?\nanswer: Across studies, adding organic materials to soil commonly increased microbial biomass and activity when manure was mixed with inorganic fertilizers, with manure alone also increasing microbial biomass; one trial found increased microbial diversity [902], and microbial biomass also rose when crop remains or straw were added [910] and when residues were retained [907]. Mixed organic\u2013inorganic amendments raised soil organic carbon and nutrients in several trials, with manure alone also boosting carbon; one trial found inconsistent nutrient effects [902]; incorporating plant material increased soil carbon across multiple studies and sometimes increased aggregate size, and straw combined with NPK raised carbon [910]; retaining residues increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes only when fertilizer was applied [907]. Straw addition reduced soil loss in one study, with mixed erosion effects depending on soil type [910]; residue retention reduced water runoff, increased water storage and reduced erosion, though some soil physical properties showed mixed responses and tillage influenced erosion when residues were removed [907]; mixed amendments reduced the size of cracks in dry soil compared to inorganic fertilizer alone or no fertilizer [902]. Nitrogen levels rose with compost or straw in several studies, and straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching, although processed wastes showed mixed nutrient results and site effects were mixed in some comparisons [910]. Yields increased with mixed manure\u2013inorganic amendments for maize [902]; barley yield rose with straw, and earlier incorporation of crop remains increased grain yields in one trial [910]; retaining residues increased yields, sometimes only with fertilizer and no-tillage [907]. Incorporating allelopathic plant remains sometimes reduced weeds relative to weeded or unweeded controls but effects varied by year, weed group or residue; suppression could be short-lived; crop growth was sometimes inhibited but could be mitigated by timing; yield effects were positive, negative or mixed, and profit exceeded unweeded but not weeded controls in one study [728]. In a salt marsh, adding organic alginate increased smooth cordgrass density and later plant height, while biomass after 52 weeks was similar to unamended plots [3244].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Retaining crop residues increased yields in two trials, with one trial finding this only when combined with fertilizer application and no\u2011tillage (907). Incorporating fresh plant material or crop remains (e.g., straw) increased barley yields in Denmark and raised grain yields when residues were incorporated earlier in the season in the Philippines (910). Adding mulch increased yields in two trials when either a live mulch or a vegetation barrier plus mulch was used (887). Growing cover crops led to higher tomato yields in one replicated trial (898). Using green manures increased grain yields in a controlled, randomized, replicated study (908). Applying organic processing wastes or their composts increased barley yield when molasses were added (891). Applying manures or agricultural composts increased crop yields in four controlled, replicated studies, with one study finding higher yields when combined with cover crops (911).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the wider soil health effects of amending soils with animal-derived products like manure or composts?\nanswer: Across multiple controlled and replicated studies, applying manures or agricultural composts increased soil microbial biomass and activity, including higher microbial respiration with poultry manure [911, 902]. Manure applications reduced soil loss and water runoff in at least one trial when combined with other treatments [911], and high rates of cotton gin compost with poultry manure improved soil structure and reduced soil loss in another trial [891]. Nutrient outcomes were mixed: several trials reported higher soil nitrogen and reduced nutrient loss with farmyard or poultry manure, with timing (e.g., winter vs autumn) affecting losses [911], while other evidence showed increased nitrate leaching or increased nutrient loss at high compost/manure rates [911, 891]. Soil carbon generally rose with manure additions, with multiple trials and a review finding higher soil organic carbon under manure or mixed organic\u2013inorganic regimes [911, 902], though effects on overall organic matter were inconsistent, with some studies showing increases in organic matter and aggregation under manure/compost and others showing no change [911]. Mixed organic\u2013inorganic amendments frequently increased microbial diversity/activity, nutrients, and organic carbon, and improved dry-soil physical condition compared with inorganic-only inputs [902].

Comparing organic vs conventional farms, multiple studies found either no difference in bat species richness or higher richness on organic farms in some cases; bat activity was sometimes higher on organic farms (overall activity, feeding activity, Brazilian free\u2011tailed bat activity, and activity of some species), with other studies finding no difference; higher activity of Myotis spp. over water/rivers and for some species over organic fields was also reported [961]. For butterflies and moths, several studies found greater species richness and abundance on organic arable farms than conventional, sometimes increasing with time since conversion, while other studies found similar richness/abundance; in one before\u2011and\u2011after study, two butterfly species decreased after conversion alongside other management changes; effects varied with landscape context and farm age in multiple studies [3907]. For mammals, reducing pesticide/fertilizer use did not increase small mammal species richness or use of field margins in Argentina; one UK/Italy study found increased wood mouse abundance with organic farming, while another found no increase for European hare [2539].
