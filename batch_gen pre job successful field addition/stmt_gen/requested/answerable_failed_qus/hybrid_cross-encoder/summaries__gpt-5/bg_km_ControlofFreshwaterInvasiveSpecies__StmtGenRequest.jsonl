For parrot\u2019s feather, multiple herbicides reduced growth in lab or field: 2,4\u2011D (often outperforming diquat, glyphosate or imazapyr in one lab study) and reducing biomass in field [1606]; triclopyr reduced growth and cover but cover later rebounded in one field study [1689]; endothall reduced growth but cover later returned to pre\u2011treatment levels in one field study [1681]; diquat reduced growth in lab but not in one field study [1680]; imazamox and imazapyr reduced growth in lab, glyphosate and glufosinate\u2011ammonium reduced biomass in field, but fluridone, clopyralid and copper chelate did not reduce growth, while flumioxazin and florpyrauxifen\u2011benzyl reduced growth [1699]; carfentrazone\u2011ethyl reduced growth in multiple lab studies [1676]. Combination treatments can improve outcomes: 2,4\u2011D plus MCPA completely eliminated parrot\u2019s feather in one field study [1606], and 2,4\u2011D plus carfentrazone\u2011ethyl gave greater short\u2011term cover reduction than dichlobenil, though not at 45 days [1606]. Adjuvants influenced success for water primrose (glyphosate efficacy increased with a sticking agent or TopFilm) [1139].

In contrast, gas-impermeable barriers placed on the lake bottom significantly reduced Asian clam abundance in a controlled study in North America [1117].

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive plants, considering examples from skunk cabbage and water primrose management?\nanswer: Across examples, herbicide choice strongly affects outcomes: for skunk cabbage, one UK study reported both glyphosate and 2,4\u2011D amine killed all plants, while another UK study found 2,4\u2011D amine at 9 L/ha eradicated skunk cabbage but glyphosate only limited growth (ID: 1102). For water primrose, triclopyr TEA at 0.25% killed 100% of young cultivated plants in a lab study, glyphosate achieved 97% mortality with a non\u2011oil sticking agent and 100% with TopFilm in a UK field study, and halosulfuron\u2011methyl significantly reduced coverage without apparent toxicity to rice (IDs: 1139). Adjuvants and formulation influence efficacy: adding specific sticking agents (non\u2011oil vs TopFilm) altered water primrose mortality from 97% to 100% (ID: 1139). Application context matters: plant age (young plants) and setting (laboratory vs field; presence of rice crop) were linked to different effectiveness and selectivity outcomes (ID: 1139). Integrating chemical applications with other methods can affect results: glyphosate plus the surfactant Cygnet\u2011Plus followed by mechanical removal achieved a 75% kill rate of water primrose in California, and a broader program combining herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion, and mulching reduced Peruvian primrose\u2011willow coverage by 85\u201390% in Australia (ID: 1140).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
