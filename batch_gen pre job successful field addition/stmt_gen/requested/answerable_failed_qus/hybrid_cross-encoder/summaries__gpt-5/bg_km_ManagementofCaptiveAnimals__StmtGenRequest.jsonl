For carnivores, unpredictable or random temporal feeding schedules reduced stereotypic pacing in tigers and cheetahs according to multiple replicated studies, increased territorial behavior in coyotes without affecting traveling or foraging in one replicated before-and-after controlled study, and increased behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in a black-footed cat in before-and-after studies [1904]. No studies were found that directly tested altering feeding schedules in relation to visitor activity or the use of automated feeders for carnivores [1914, 1913].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the alternatives to feeding processed or commercial pellet diets to captive primates and carnivores?\nanswer: For primates, identified alternatives include presenting whole foods rather than chopped or processed items, which increased amount consumed and time spent feeding in macaques [1323]; offering fresh produce instead of pellet feed, which increased feeding time and reduced inactivity in rhesus macaques [1335]; providing cut branches (browse), with captive gorillas using wild-like processing skills when given stinging nettles [1332]; providing nectar (including artificial nectar), for which no direct quantitative evidence on effects was captured [1331]; and installing live vegetation in planters for foraging, which increased time spent foraging by chimpanzees compared to browse/grass with the normal diet [1327]. For carnivores, alternatives include feeding whole carcasses (with or without organs/gastrointestinal tract), which reduced pacing in lions, leopards, snow leopards and cougars but increased pacing in tigers; in cheetahs, whole rabbit was associated with lower blood protein urea, zinc and vitamin A than supplemented beef and with lower inflammatory bowel indicators; in ocelots and African wildcats, whole young chickens had lower digestible energy/fat and lower organic matter digestibility than commercial or ground-chicken diets [1901]; feeding a plant-derived protein diet, which increased digestible energy and dry matter digestibility but decreased mineral retention and plasma taurine in maned wolves compared to (supplemented) animal-based protein diets [1903]; allocating fast days, which was associated with more pacing on non-feeding days in large felids fed once every three days [1906]; supplementing meat-based diets with vitamins or minerals (no direct quantitative evidence captured) [1907]; and altering food abundance or type seasonally (no direct quantitative evidence captured) [1910].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Presenting food frozen in ice increases activity and reduces abnormal or stereotypic behaviours in felids [1923].
