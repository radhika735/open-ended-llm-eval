[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective interventions for restoring degraded shrubland habitats?\nanswer: Evidence on shrubland restoration is mixed and taxon-specific. In the UK, restoring moorland led to one or two pairs of northern lapwing breeding where none had previously bred; studies in the USA and Azores reported increases in target gamebird and seabird populations following shrubland restoration among other interventions, while a replicated UK study that combined several interventions found a negative relationship with the young-to-old ratio of grey partridges (364). In heathland/shrubland, restored moorland moth communities became more similar to established heather moorland than to degraded sites; in the Netherlands, heathlands restored by topsoil removal had lower butterfly species richness than the surrounding landscape, but within restored sites, abundance was higher where heather litter was spread; a UK site managed for heathland restoration supported a released silver-studded blue population that increased over 11 years and expanded its range (3946). In Mexico, restored shrubland had similar reptile and amphibian species richness to unrestored areas but higher lizard abundance (3751). For mammals, restored desert scrub or shrubland had species richness and small mammal abundance similar to undisturbed areas in the USA and Mexico; restoring shrubland after tree clearance did not increase mule deer use beyond tree clearance alone (2569). No studies were found evaluating restoration in areas predicted to have suitable future climate for shrubland species (1672) or actions to restore/create habitat connectivity between shrublands (1677).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the general effects of altering livestock grazing practices on shrubland vegetation?\nanswer: Excluding livestock with fences increased shrub cover or abundance and increased shrub biomass and the biomass and height of individual heather plants; heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas, though some studies recorded decreased woody plant cover or no/mixed changes in shrub cover; vegetation height and biomass increased; effects on grass cover varied (declines, no change, or increases reported); herb/forb abundance often showed no difference or mixed responses; plant species richness showed no change in one study but was lower in fenced areas in another [1545]. Increasing livestock density was associated with declines in common heather cover and lower dwarf shrub cover compared to ungrazed areas, but in some cases increased heather cover and increased numbers of heather seedlings; cattle grazing increased non-ericaceous shrubs but reduced ericaceous shrubs; one study found no change in shrub cover; species richness was higher in some grazed areas, unchanged in one case, and decreased in another; vegetation height decreased; grass and sedge cover often increased with higher grazing intensity, though one study reported reduced grass and herb cover; grass height declined in one heathland site; some studies reported mixed effects on grasses and herbaceous species [1628].

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of various soil treatments, such as adding topsoil or mulch, on the restoration of degraded shrublands?\nanswer: Adding topsoil increased cover or abundance of heathland plant species in two UK studies, increased seedlings for most heathland plants in one UK study, and increased woody plant abundance in a site comparison in Spain; one UK study reported increased forb cover and reduced grass cover, and a controlled study in Namibia found plant cover and species number increased but remained lower than at an undisturbed site (1686). Adding topsoil alongside sowing increased grass biomass but reduced forb biomass compared to topsoil alone in a randomized, replicated, paired, controlled USA study (1857). Stripping/removing topsoil had mixed outcomes: two UK studies found no increase in heather or heathland species cover, one UK study found increased heather cover, another UK study found increased cover of both specialist and generalist plants without increasing species richness, one paired UK study found increased annual grass cover and decreased perennial grass cover, one UK study found turf removal reduced wavy hair grass cover, and a before-and-after UK trial found increased gorse and sheep\u2019s sorrel cover and higher plant species numbers after stripping surface soil (1685). In heathlands restored by topsoil removal, butterfly species richness was lower than in the surrounding landscape, while abundance was higher where heather litter was spread compared to where it was not (3946). Adding mulch and fertilizer did not increase seedling abundance of seven shrub species and did not change grass cover in a randomized, controlled USA study (1694). Adding mulch followed by sowing shrub seeds increased seedling abundance of one of seven shrub species but did not reduce grass cover in a randomized, controlled USA study (1650).

However, two randomized, controlled studies found no increase in heather cover, one controlled study reported no change in bracken abundance, and one replicated, randomized, controlled study found no effect on species richness or diversity [1652]. Additional reported vegetation responses after bracken herbicide treatments included increased cover of wavy hair\u2011grass and sheep\u2019s fescue, increased cover of gorse, increased abundance of common cow\u2011wheat, and increased numbers of silver birch seedlings in controlled studies [1652]. For grass control, four of five controlled studies (two replicated) reported lower grass or non\u2011native grass cover where herbicides were used, and two randomized, replicated, controlled studies reported reduced purple moor grass cover [1643].
