[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: For arable fields in the Mediterranean, how does a no-tillage system compare with a reduced tillage system for improving soil health?\nanswer: Across Mediterranean studies, both no-tillage and reduced tillage often increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage: meta-analyses from Mediterranean countries and multiple studies from Spain and Italy reported higher organic matter under no-tillage, and another meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries reported higher organic matter under reduced tillage [1369, 1371]. For nutrients, Mediterranean evidence was mixed for both practices: under no-tillage, studies from Italy, Spain, and Portugal found more nitrogen in some comparisons and less in others, and phosphorus was sometimes higher and sometimes lower; under reduced tillage, studies from Italy and Spain reported more nitrogen or phosphorus in some comparisons, with other studies in Spain and Syria finding similar or lower nitrogen in some cases [1369, 1371]. Soil biological responses were also mixed but frequently positive: no-tillage increased microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with other Spanish studies finding similar or lower biomass; reduced tillage similarly showed increases in microbial biomass in some studies from Italy and Spain, with some Spanish and Syrian studies reporting similar or lower biomass [1369, 1371]. Soil structure tended to improve under both systems in Mediterranean contexts but with variability: no-tillage commonly produced more stable soils in Spain (with some mixed results), while reduced tillage in Spain increased aggregate water-stability or large aggregates in some comparisons, with other studies reporting similar or lower stability [1369, 1371]. Regarding water-related soil health indicators, no-tillage in Spain often increased soil water content and improved water-use efficiency for barley in some comparisons; reduced tillage in Egypt and Spain often increased soil water content and improved crop water-use efficiency in Spain and Turkey, though Lebanon studies reported lower water content under both practices in some comparisons [1384, 1386]. Greenhouse gas fluxes relevant to soil processes showed mixed outcomes in Mediterranean studies for both practices, with some Spanish and Italian studies finding higher or lower CO2 under no-tillage, and Spanish studies reporting higher, lower, or similar CO2 and N2O under reduced tillage [1369, 1371]. Overall, Mediterranean evidence indicates both no-tillage and reduced tillage can improve aspects of soil health relative to conventional tillage, with direction and magnitude varying by indicator and study [1369, 1371, 1384, 1386].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence say about how adding different organic amendments to soil affects greenhouse gas emissions on Mediterranean farmland?\nanswer: Across Mediterranean studies, adding slurry to soil was associated with higher nitrous oxide emissions in most comparisons, higher carbon dioxide in some comparisons, and either reduced methane absorption or no change in methane fluxes (Spain) [1365]. Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic ones often increased carbon dioxide emissions (Italy, Spain), led to similar or greater methane absorption depending on the study (Spain), and resulted in similar or lower nitrous oxide emissions, with a meta-analysis reporting lower nitrous oxide after solid organic fertilizers compared to inorganic fertilizers [1366]. Adding sewage sludge increased carbon dioxide emissions (Spain, USA) [1364]. Adding manure increased carbon dioxide emissions (USA) and increased nitrous oxide emissions (Spain) [1363]. An implementation comparison reported that plots with slurry absorbed methane while plots with manure emitted methane (Spain) [1366].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do additions of compost, manure, and slurry compare in their effects on soil organic matter and nutrients in Mediterranean farmland?\nanswer: In Mediterranean contexts, applying manure or compost increased soil organic matter and improved soil physical properties in a replicated, randomized study from Turkey (manure and compost) [911]. For slurry, studies from Spain and multiple Mediterranean countries found similar soil organic matter with or without slurry in most cases, though one replicated, randomized study in Spain reported higher organic matter with slurry in some comparisons [1365]. Regarding nutrients, studies from Spain reported reduced nutrient loss and higher soil nitrogen when manure was applied [911]. For slurry, replicated, randomized studies from Spain and Portugal reported mixed effects on soil nitrate (higher in some Spanish studies; similar in others) and inconsistent effects on ammonium (one Spanish study higher; another similar) [1365]. Comparing compost and manure directly, a study from Italy found plots fertilized with compost had more soil organic matter, nutrients, and microbial biomass than those with manure [1366]. With compost additions, Mediterranean studies also reported greater nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and organic matter in runoff from Spanish plots, and greater nitrate leaching in one of four comparisons in Portugal [1377].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Other studies in grasslands and shrublands reported fewer species or fewer native species, or smaller increases in species numbers, when grazers were excluded, in some comparisons [2292; 1417]. Some studies in shrublands found no difference in plant diversity between exclosures and grazed plots [2292; 1417].
