Additionally, mechanical removal methods have proven effective. A study in Portugal highlighted that mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes, or the installation of a sand filter, could permanently eliminate or decrease the population of Asian clams (1119). Suction dredging, as tested in a trial in North America, reduced Asian clam densities in sediment by 96% over two weeks, with the results lasting for a year (1120).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What factors, such as herbicide type or the use of adjuvants, influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather?\nanswer: Several factors influence the success of chemical control for invasive aquatic plants like water primrose and parrot's feather. For water primrose, the herbicide triclopyr TEA applied at a 0.25% concentration has been found to kill 100% of young plants (1139). The herbicide glyphosate has also been shown to be effective, with its success being influenced by the use of adjuvants, as 97% mortality was achieved when mixed with a non-oil based sticking agent, and 100% mortality was achieved when combined with TopFilm (1139). The herbicide halosulfuron-methyl has also been shown to significantly reduce water primrose coverage (1139). Additionally, combining herbicide application with physical removal methods has been successful, with one study showing a 75% kill rate of water primrose when using glyphosate and a surface active agent followed by mechanical removal (1140). Another study showed an 85-90% reduction in Peruvian primrose-willow coverage through a combination of herbicide application, physical removal, and other actions (1140).\n\nFor parrot's feather, the herbicide 2,4-D has been found to reduce its growth and biomass (1606). The effectiveness of 2,4-D can be enhanced when combined with other herbicides, such as MCPA, which resulted in the complete elimination of parrot's feather (1606). Combining 2,4-D with carfentrazone-ethyl also led to a higher reduction in cover than the herbicide dichlobenil alone in the short term (1606). Other herbicides such as imazamox, imazapyr, glyphosate, and gluphosinate-ammonium have also been found to reduce the growth or biomass of parrot's feather (1699). Conversely, the herbicides fluridone, clopyralid, and copper chelate were found to be ineffective in reducing the growth of parrot's feather (1699).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The success of chemical control for water primrose is influenced by the type of herbicide used, with triclopyr TEA, glyphosate, and halosulfuron-methyl all showing effectiveness in different studies (1139). The effectiveness of glyphosate on water primrose was improved when mixed with sticking agents, achieving 97% mortality with a non-oil-based agent and 100% with TopFilm (1139). Furthermore, combining herbicides with other methods, such as physical removal, can increase success rates. A combination of glyphosate, a surface active agent, and mechanical removal resulted in a 75% kill rate of water primrose (1140).

However, one study in the USA found that bullfrog populations can rebound rapidly after the intensive removal of adults (1045). The shooting of metamorphosed individuals, as part of a combination treatment, was found to significantly reduce the number of recorded adults and juveniles in one study in France (1045). For the removal of juveniles, double fyke nets were found to be effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds in a Belgian study (1046), and a study in France showed a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles following the removal of juveniles by trapping as part of a combination treatment (1046).
