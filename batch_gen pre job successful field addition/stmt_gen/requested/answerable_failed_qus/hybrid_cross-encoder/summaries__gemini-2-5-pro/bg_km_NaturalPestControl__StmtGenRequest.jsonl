One method involves the use of bird scarers (199). A study in the USA found that broadcasting American crow distress calls led to reduced damage in almond orchards (199). In Pakistan, a study showed that hanging reflector ribbons above crops resulted in a lower abundance of four pest species (199). Restoring habitats along watercourses is another approach, although one study in the USA observed an increase in weeds in orchards adjacent to restored riparian habitats (1402). The management style of the orchard also plays a role. For instance, a study in the USA revealed a greater species richness and diversity of leaf-eating arthropods in unmanaged and partially managed orchards compared to commercially managed ones (3917). Conversely, a German study noted a lower abundance of butterflies and burnet moths in managed orchards compared to abandoned ones (3917). Additionally, a German study found that mown orchards had higher plant species richness than grazed or abandoned ones, but there were no differences in the numbers of bee and wasp species or brood cells (703). Traditional orchards in Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas showed little benefit for birds, and in the UK, the presence of orchards was negatively related to the focal bird species (240).

Two out of three studies in Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa found fewer pests, and two replicated, controlled studies found fewer witchweeds. This approach also resulted in less pest damage in two out of three studies and higher yields in four out of five studies [753].\n\nAltering the timing of insecticide use can also be beneficial. One controlled study from the UK reported more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier in the growing season [723]. Two of four studies found fewer pests or less disease damage when insecticides were applied early [723]. In terms of yield, one study found higher yields when insecticides were applied at times of suspected crop susceptibility [723].\n\nAlley cropping has shown mixed results. While one study found more wasps and spiders, another found that effects on parasitism varied [718]. Two out of four studies actually found more pests in alley-cropped plots [718].

One approach is to modify the habitat to support natural pest control. For instance, planting hedgerows can increase the number of natural enemies and the parasitism of pest eggs, leading to fewer pests (1401). Similarly, planting flower strips has been found to enhance pest reduction and attract more natural enemies (1400). Another strategy involves soil management, such as adding compost, which can reduce crop diseases and plant mortality in some instances (1392). The use of organic fertilizer has shown mixed results, with one study finding an increase in aphid numbers and another finding no significant difference (1393). Direct manipulation of beneficial and harmful insect populations is also a viable strategy. For example, isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants has been shown to reduce pest damage and increase yields (773). Conversely, excluding ants that protect pests can lead to greater parasitism of those pests and, in some cases, a reduction in their numbers (886). The use of mixed pastures instead of monocultures has been associated with a reduction in weeds and, in some studies, fewer pests (721). Finally, employing grazing instead of cutting for pasture management has demonstrated varied effects on natural enemies and, in one study, resulted in an increase in pest numbers (885).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In another study, reflector ribbons hung above crops were found to decrease the abundance of four pest species (199).\n\nPlanting or maintaining ground cover in orchards is another method, though studies show mixed outcomes. For pest regulation, one study found that more leafhopper eggs were parasitized in plots with cover crops, while two other studies found inconsistent or no differences (1395). In terms of crop damage, one study reported more pest-damaged grapes in plots with cover crops (1395). The effect on pest numbers also varies, with some studies finding fewer leafhoppers in plots with cover crops, and another finding more (1395). However, some studies did find a higher number of natural enemies in plots with ground cover (1395). Mowing the ground cover may be a beneficial practice, as two studies found fewer pests in mown plots (1395). It is worth noting that one study found more gophers in plots with clover compared to other cover crops (1395).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This approach has been found to increase the number of natural enemies and require fewer pesticide applications, leading to lower production costs [750]. While some studies have reported satisfactory pest control and similar crop damage and yields compared to conventional spraying, others have found that pest control can be inadequate, and crop damage may increase [750]. Profits have been found to be similar to conventional methods, though effects can vary [750]. To help set these thresholds, parasitism rates can be incorporated, which one study on tomatoes found resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage [726]. Another alternative is to alter the timing of insecticide use, such as spraying earlier in the growing season, which has been shown to result in a greater number of natural enemies and, in some cases, fewer pests [723]. While the effects on yield can be mixed, one study showed that applying insecticides only at times of suspected crop susceptibility could lead to higher profits [723].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two replicated studies from the USA found more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips, compared to fields without planted flower strips, in some comparisons (1400). Two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark found more natural enemies when herbicide treatments were delayed (774). One replicated, controlled study from the USA found that similar percentages of pests were consumed by natural enemies in plots with or without added compost (1392). This study also found similar ratios of natural enemies to pests (mostly aphids) in plots with or without added compost (1392).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
