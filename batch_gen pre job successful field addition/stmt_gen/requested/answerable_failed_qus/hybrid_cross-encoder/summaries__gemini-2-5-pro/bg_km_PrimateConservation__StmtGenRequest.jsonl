There is currently no evidence to determine the effectiveness of removing human food waste (1561), installing mechanical barriers such as fences or ditches (1436), or using the scent of primate predators (1448) to deter primates. Similarly, no evidence was found regarding the control of habitat-altering mammals through exclusion or translocation to benefit primate populations (1532).\n\nStudies on light and sound deterrents have shown mixed results. The use of frightening devices that emit both lights and sound was found to be ineffective at reducing crop intrusions by white-tailed deer or food consumption by elk and mule deer in two studies (2456). In one study, red lasers were also found to be ineffective at dispersing white-tailed deer, while another study found that spotlights directed at the eyes of Asian elephants did reduce the probability of crop damage (2496).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, not all habitat protection has been successful. One study in Kenya found that Tana River red colobus monkey and crested mangabey numbers decreased despite the area being declared legally protected, and a study in Brazil found that most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years in a legally protected area, although they did reproduce and the surviving offspring partly compensated for adult mortality (1578).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Similarly, a project in Belize saw a 138% increase in black howler monkey numbers over 13 years (1512), and in Madagascar, one lemur species saw an increase in individuals (1512).

Additionally, in Japan, prohibiting the feeding of Japanese macaques by tourists led to a decline in aggressive interactions between the primates and humans (1507).\n\nHowever, negative impacts have also been observed. In Kenya, numbers of Tana River red colobus and crested mangabeys decreased despite a tourism project (1512). An intensive tourism project in China, which included food provisioning and range restrictions for Tibetan macaques, resulted in increased stress levels and infant mortality rates as high as 100% in some years (1512). In Madagascar, a tourism project was followed by a decline in population size, body size, and group size for two other lemur species (1512).

In one study, involving communities in the management of a sanctuary was associated with an increase in black howler monkey numbers over a 13-year period (1565). Another study found that after the implementation of a community-based monitoring scheme, incidents of gorilla poaching stopped (1565). Furthermore, community-based participation in park management was linked to an increasing population of Himalayan brown bears in one case (2395). In another instance, farmers who were part of a community-based conservancy were less likely to remove large carnivores from their land (2395). Public education initiatives in marine conservation have also been beneficial, with participants in educational tours or exhibitions showing more willingness to change their behavior, donate to conservation, or help save entangled dolphins (2935). However, not all community involvement has been successful. In one project, a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements despite community participation (1565). Additionally, in one region, mountain gorilla numbers decreased over a 41-year period despite an environmental education program (1565).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Similarly, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of using natural hedges (1437) or unpalatable buffer crops (1438) for the same purpose. In all three cases, 'no evidence' indicates that no studies were found that directly and quantitatively tested these actions during systematic journal and report searches, making it impossible to assess their effectiveness or potential harmful impacts (1436, 1437, 1438).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
