A separate review of 30 trials found that 29 showed occupancy by bees, including some endangered species [47]. The number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision [47, 80], and local population size or the number of emerging bees has been shown to increase when nest boxes are provided [80]. In contrast, two replicated trials that tested bumblebee nest boxes found very low uptake of 2% or less [80]. \n\nFor solitary bees, occupancy rates were reported as between 1-26% of available cavities in two studies [80]. In terms of design, one study found that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than four other types [47].

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides planting floral resources, what alternative habitat modifications can provide nesting sites for different types of bees on farmland?\nanswer: Artificial nest sites for solitary bees have been shown to be occupied by bees in 29 out of 30 replicated trials (47). Many species of solitary bees, including some endangered species, readily nest in these boxes (47). For some European solitary bee species, nest boxes should be placed within 150 to 600 meters of foraging resources (47). Designs such as cut hollow stems, tubes, and blocks of wood with drilled holes have been shown to be effective (47). One trial indicated that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes were more productive than those with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes, which suffered from parasitism or mould (47). However, a smaller trial found cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes to be more productive for a specific bee species (47). The repeated provision of nest boxes at a site has been shown to double the number of occupied nests over three years (47). Additionally, a study in blueberry fields observed an increase in the estimated number of foraging Osmia bees in fields with nest boxes compared to those without (47). However, there are potential downsides, as 11 replicated trials have recorded parasites or predators attacking solitary bees in nest boxes, with mortality rates varying significantly (47). Introduced species, such as the European earwig and European leafcutter bee, may also occupy the boxes, sometimes more frequently than native bees (47). A trial using soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes was not successful (47). There is no evidence to suggest that increasing the use of clover leys enhances wild bee populations, and one trial indicated that fields with white clover did not preferentially attract solitary bees for nesting (16).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective interventions for providing nesting resources for different types of wild bees?\nanswer: Interventions for providing nesting resources for wild bees include providing nest boxes for solitary bees and bumblebees, as well as providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees. Ten studies on solitary bee nest boxes showed they were readily used by bees, with occupancy rates between 1% and 26% of available cavities (80). Two replicated studies found that providing nest boxes for red mason bees increased the local population size or number of emerging bees (80). Similarly, three trials on agricultural land have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision (47). One trial found that the number of foraging Osmia bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without (47). The number of bee species found in nest boxes ranged from 4.6 to 33 species (80). Some species considered endangered have been found to nest in these boxes (47). In contrast, two replicated trials testing bumblebee nest boxes found very low uptake, at 2% or less (80).\n\nRegarding the design and placement of these nesting resources, one replicated study from Germany found that nest boxes should be placed 150-600 m from forage resources (80, 47). Twenty-three replicated trials have shown that nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes are occupied by solitary bees, and eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes (47). One study found that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while plastic-lined holes or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (47). Certain solitary bee species have also been shown to nest in wooden boxes without stems or confining walls inside (47). However, one small trial that tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found that they were not occupied (47). Eleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators (47). Two trials also showed that introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species will use nest boxes, and in one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees (47). There is no evidence for the effects of introducing nest boxes already stocked with solitary bees (81).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Beyond simply reducing general pesticide use on agricultural land, what other farming system changes show potential benefits for wild bees?\nanswer: Evidence regarding the impact of organic farming on wild bees is inconsistent. Three replicated trials in Europe or Canada have indicated a higher abundance and, in one case, greater diversity of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional methods (25). However, three other replicated trials in Europe or the USA found no significant differences in the numbers of bumblebees, bumblebee species, or wild bees visiting flowering crops between conventional and organic farms (25).\n\nAgri-environment schemes have also shown mixed results. Four replicated trials in Europe demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under such schemes (24). Conversely, four other replicated trials in Europe found no enhancement in the number of bees or bee species on land managed under similar schemes, and two UK trials found no enhancement of bumblebee populations on a wider landscape scale (24).\n\nPlanting dedicated floral resources on farmland has been shown to attract wild bees. Fourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants (17). Specifically, ten trials found that patches of Phacelia tanacetifolia attracted considerable numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees (17), although one trial in Greece noted it was not very attractive to wild bees (17). Additionally, a UK trial found that perennial leguminous herbs like clovers were more appealing to bumblebees in landscapes with a higher proportion of arable farming (17). While these plantings attract foraging bees, evidence for a wider population benefit is mixed. One trial showed that planting lupine in orchards enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees (17), but another trial found no increase in bee numbers or species richness in farmland 50-1,500m away from flower patches (17), and two other trials found few solitary bees nesting in fields sown with phacelia or clover (17).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study found high larval mortality when *Osmia cornuta* were reared on artificial pollen-based diets (54).

While there has been success in rearing some declining North American species like the half-black bumblebee (B. vagans), yellow-banded bumblebee (B. terricola), and red-belted bumblebee (B. rufocinctus) to the adult stage, attempts to rear the yellow bumblebee (B. fervidus), the rusty-patched bumblebee, and the American bumblebee (B. pensylvanicus) resulted in larvae dying before reaching adulthood [50]. The diet of captively reared bumblebees significantly influences reproductive success, with fresh, high-protein pollen leading to better outcomes [50]. Specific artificial light and hibernation regimes have also been shown to affect egg-laying and survival [50].\n\nFollowing reintroduction, the success of laboratory-reared colonies has been variable. Of four trials that monitored colonies until new queens were produced, two (both in the UK) reported very low or zero queen production, while the other two saw good numbers of new queens [52]. Rates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees also varied, with two trials reporting high rates (25-79%), while five others found none [52]. One trial indicated that parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability later in the season [52].

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of reducing the intensity of farming practices, such as tillage, grazing, and meadow management, on wild bee populations?\nanswer: Four replicated trials in Europe comparing extensively farmed meadows with conventional ones have yielded mixed results; two found higher numbers and diversity of wild bees on meadows with delayed cutting and reduced agrochemical use, while two found no difference in bee diversity or abundance with reduced fertilizer use or cutting intensity [22]. The evidence for organic farming's impact on wild bees is also inconsistent. Three replicated trials in Europe or Canada showed that wild bee abundance is higher under organic arable farming, with one of these also indicating higher bee diversity [25]. In contrast, three other replicated trials in Europe or the USA found no significant difference in the numbers of bumblebees, bumblebee species, or wild bees visiting flowering crops between conventional and organic farms [25].\n\nFourteen trials in Europe and North America have demonstrated that perennial or annual sown flowering plants on farmland can attract substantial numbers of foraging wild bees [17]. For example, ten trials focusing on Phacelia tanacetifolia found it attracted many wild bees, particularly bumblebees, in all but one case [17]. A UK trial also showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs like clovers were more appealing to bumblebees in landscapes dominated by arable farming [17]. However, the broader effects on bee populations are not as clear. One trial indicated that planted lupines in Canadian apple orchards significantly boosted the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees [17]. Conversely, a trial in the Netherlands did not find an increase in bee numbers or species richness in farmland 50-1,500 meters away from planted flower patches, and two German trials recorded few or no solitary bee species nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions, other than providing bare ground, can be taken to create or enhance nesting sites for various bee species?\nanswer: Providing nest boxes for solitary bees is an effective measure, with studies showing they are readily used and can increase local bee populations [80]. The number of occupied nests has been observed to nearly double over three years with repeated provision [80]. Occupancy rates for these boxes range from 1% to 26% of available cavities and can support between 4.6 and 33 bee species [80]. For optimal results, nest boxes should be placed 150-600 meters from forage resources, with materials like reed stems or wood being particularly effective for red mason bees [80]. However, bumblebee nest boxes have a very low uptake rate of 2% or less [80]. Another effective action is the retention or creation of hedgerows, which can lead to higher crop visitation by native bees and support a greater number of bee species and individuals compared to areas without them [2515]. While planted hedgerows may host fewer ground-nesting bees, older and more established hedgerows, particularly those with native plants, are found to support a higher diversity of bee species [2515].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions are available to provide nesting resources for bees on agricultural land?\nanswer: Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of providing artificial nest sites for solitary bees, with many species readily occupying them (47). Successful nest box designs include the use of cut hollow stems, tubes, or blocks of wood with drilled holes (47, 80). However, one trial showed that nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or those made of plastic or paper tubes, were less effective due to issues with parasitism or mould (47). In contrast, two trials testing bumblebee nest boxes found very low uptake, with 2% or less being used (80).\n\nFor solitary bees, the number of occupied nests has been shown to nearly double over three years when nest boxes are repeatedly provided at a given site (47, 80). It is recommended that nest boxes be placed within 150 to 600 meters of foraging resources (47, 80). However, there are potential downsides, as eleven replicated trials have recorded instances of parasites or predators attacking bees in nest boxes (47). Additionally, a trial of soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes was not successful (47).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In gardens, planting bee forage or native plants has been shown to increase the number and diversity of wild bees (1). Another study found that gardens with lower intensity management, which includes less tidy gardening and reduced pesticide use, had a higher number of bumblebee species, although this did not affect solitary bees (2). For road verges, a study in the USA demonstrated that verges planted with native prairie vegetation supported a greater number and diversity of bees compared to verges with frequently mown grass (30). In the case of areas under power lines, a trial in the USA found a higher number of bee species in areas managed as scrub compared to those managed as annually mown grassland (31). However, for the action of managing land under power lines to benefit wildlife, no evidence was captured regarding its effects on farmland wildlife (99).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do the impacts of planting floral resources for bees differ when implemented at a local patch scale versus a wider landscape scale?\nanswer: A large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of \u2018pollen and nectar\u2019 agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (21, 362). Fourteen trials in Europe and North America have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in the agricultural environment (17). Ten of these trials monitored bees foraging on patches sown with a high proportion of phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia on farmland, and all but one found substantial numbers of foraging wild (non-Apis) bees, particularly bumblebees Bombus spp., with the number of foraging bee species ranging from eight to 35 (17). One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs, including clovers, were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming (17). However, another trial showed that planted patches of bigleaf lupine Lupinus polyphyllus in commercial apple orchards in Novia Scotia, Canada, significantly enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees Osmia lignaria (17). One trial in the Netherlands showed that bee numbers and species richness are not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches, and two trials in Germany found no or relatively few species of solitary bee nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover respectively (17).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
