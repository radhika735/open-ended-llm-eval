[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In an agricultural landscape, what are the effects of different habitat and farming management practices on bat populations?\nanswer: Several studies have examined the effects of different farming practices on bat populations. Twelve studies comparing organic and conventional farming found that while five of seven studies showed no difference in the number of bat species, two studies found a greater number of species on organic farms (961). In terms of bat activity, five of nine studies found no difference, but four studies reported higher overall bat activity on organic farms (961). Some studies in the UK and France indicated higher activity for certain bat species in specific habitats on organic farms (961). Agri-environment schemes, based on three UK studies, did not consistently show benefits for bat populations (962). Two of these studies found no significant difference in bat activity or species occurrence between farms in agri-environment schemes and conventional farms, with one study noting lower overall bat activity on farms within the schemes (962). In relation to hedge management, two UK studies suggest that trimming hedges less frequently could be advantageous for bats. Hedges that had not been trimmed for three or more years were found to have a higher number of bat species and increased activity for two out of eight species or species groups when compared to hedges trimmed more recently (1943). Conversely, a separate study discovered no variance in pipistrelle activity between hedges managed for wildlife under agri-environment schemes and those on conventional farms (1943).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions can be taken during building developments to mitigate the disturbance and loss of bat roosts?\nanswer: To mitigate the disturbance and loss of bat roosts during building developments, several actions can be taken. One approach is to create alternative roosts, although the success of this is varied. Studies have shown that in some cases bats did not use the alternative roosts provided (949). In other instances, bat boxes or lofts were used at 13-74% of development sites (949). Purpose-built roosts have been found to be used in higher or similar numbers to the original roosts in some cases, and in lower numbers in others (949). It has also been found that new bat boxes or lofts are four times less likely to be used by returning bats than roosts that are retained during development (949).\n\nAnother action is the legal protection of bats through licensing during development. However, a UK review found that 68% of roosts were destroyed under licensed activities (1935). Additionally, 81% of licensees did not carry out post-development monitoring to assess the use of the installed roost structures (1935). Some compensation roosts provided under license are used, with one study finding 5 of 28 were used (1935), and another review finding 31-67% were used (1935).\n\nRetaining existing bat roosts and access points within developments is another option. One study found similar numbers of bats roosting in an attic after access points were retained during renovations (947). A UK review found that two-thirds of retained and modified roosts were used after development, and retained roosts were more likely to be used than newly created ones (947).\n\nFinally, there is the option to provide training on bat ecology and conservation to the building and development sector, but no studies were found to evaluate the effectiveness of this (997). Similarly, no studies were found on the effectiveness of installing sound barriers near roosts (2023).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Another study in the USA found that resin bat boxes were occupied more quickly than wood boxes [1024]. Larger bat boxes were found to have higher occupancy rates in one of two studies [1024]. In Spain, bat boxes with two compartments were more frequently occupied than those with one, and in Lithuania, breeding colonies occupied standard and four- or five-chamber boxes while individuals used flat boxes [1024].

Occupancy was also higher in farm forestry sites compared to native forests in Australia, in pine stands over mixed deciduous stands in Poland, and in forest fragments over pasture in Costa Rica [1024]. One study found higher occupancy rates when boxes were installed in areas where bats were already known to roost [1024]. Furthermore, a review in the UK indicated a correlation between the number of bat boxes at a site and the likelihood of occupation [1024].
