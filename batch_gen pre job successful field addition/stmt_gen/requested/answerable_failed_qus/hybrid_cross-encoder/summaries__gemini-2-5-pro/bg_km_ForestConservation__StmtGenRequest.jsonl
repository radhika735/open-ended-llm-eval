A replicated, controlled study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 months, but not after 44 months (1268). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that plastic guards increased the height and diameter growth rates of planted baldcypress seedlings over one growing season (3330).\n\nWhen it comes to fencing, one replicated, paired, controlled study in Australia reported that planted swamp gum seedlings had a much higher survival rate over one year in plots fenced to exclude mammals than in open plots (3330). However, two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in the USA reported that exclusion fencing sometimes increased the survival of planted tree seedlings, but sometimes had no clear or significant effect, depending on factors such as the season of planting, seedling elevation, and site (3330). One replicated, paired, controlled study in a floodplain swamp clearing in the USA found that fencing to exclude deer had no significant effect on total tree seedling density after three years (3330). The same study did find that the fenced plots contained taller tree seedlings after three years (3330). In contrast, a different replicated, paired, controlled study in the USA found that the average height of white cedar saplings increased by a similar amount between two and five years after planting in plots that were fenced to exclude deer and plots that were left unfenced (3330). Two replicated, paired, controlled studies in freshwater wetlands in Canada and Israel reported that protecting emergent herbs with silt screens or herbivore fencing increased survival rates over 12\u201318 months after planting (3328). There were no studies found that evaluated the effects of using fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation (1839).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, one study noted a decrease in plant species richness and abundance, and another found no impact on tree abundance [1223]. Additionally, shelterwood harvesting's effects on reptile species richness and abundance were mixed when compared to areas with no management.

However, one study found a decrease in plant species richness and abundance, and another found no effect on tree abundance [1223].

Nine of the studies found that some species did not return to restored sites or were less common than in original forests, and one study found that overall territory density decreased over time, while another found that territory densities were similar between sites planted with oak saplings and unplanted sites (360). Two site comparison studies found that mammal species richness in restored forests was similar to that in established forests (2570). One of two replicated studies found that replanted or regrowing forest supported a higher abundance of hazel dormice than did coppiced forest, while the other study found only low numbers of common brushtail possums or common ringtail possums by 7\u201330 years after planting (2570). Restored forest areas had higher reptile abundance than remnant forest areas, according to one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Australia (3749). Two of three replicated studies found that areas of restored forest had similar abundances of snakes and six lizard species as unrestored areas (3749). One site comparison study in Brazil found that a reforested area had significantly lower bat diversity than a native forest fragment (2050). However, a replicated, controlled, site comparison study in Australia found that forests restored after mining had significantly higher or similar bat activity as unmined forests for five of seven bat species (2050). Three site comparison studies found that naturally generating or secondary forest had a different community composition of caterpillars, moths, and butterflies to replanted forest, oil palm plantations, pasture, or remnant primary forest (3936).

For instance, the removal of woody debris after a timber harvest has been found to have mixed effects, with one study indicating an increase in understory vegetation cover, while three others reported no effect or mixed results (1213). Similarly, the impact on understory vegetation species richness and diversity was either non-existent or mixed in four studies, and two studies showed no effect on the cover and species diversity of trees (1213). Regarding young trees, one study noted an increase in density after debris removal, another a decrease, and three studies found either mixed effects or no effect on density (1213).\n\nShelterwood harvesting, on the other hand, has been shown to be more consistently beneficial. Six out of seven studies, which included research from the USA, found that this technique increased the abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees. However, one study contradicted these findings, reporting a decrease in plant species richness and abundance, and another found no effect on tree abundance (1223).\n\nGroup-selection harvesting has also yielded mixed results. Four of eight studies, including one in the USA, found that it increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees.

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: As an alternative to using herbicides, what other methods can be used to control vegetation competition for seedlings and young trees?\nanswer: Mechanically removing understory vegetation after tree planting has been studied as an alternative to herbicides [1256]. Five studies in multiple countries found no effect of this practice on seedling emergence, survival, growth rate, or frost damage, though one study did find that removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass [1256]. Another study showed that removing sheep laurel shrubs specifically, increased the growth rate and height of black spruce seedlings [1256].\n\nOther methods include clearing vegetation before planting, which had no significant effect on seedling height or diameter in some studies [3334]. However, one study found that baldcypress seedlings were taller when planted amongst cut woody vegetation [3334]. The removal of reed canarygrass before planting was found to often increase the survival rate of tree and shrub seedlings [3334]. In one study, there were more seedlings in plots that had been cleared of vegetation before sowing seeds [3334].\n\nDisturbing the soil before seeding or planting is another alternative. Four out of five studies found that this action increased plant emergence [3413]. One study found that disturbing the soil before planting forb seedlings had no effect on their growth, but another found that it increased the cover of forb species [3413]. One study also found that disturbing soil before sowing seeds increased seedling survival [3413].\n\nPlanting or seeding under established vegetation has also been considered, with one study showing mixed effects on blackbrush seedling emergence [1714].\n\nFinally, the addition of mulch has been studied. One study in Canada found that adding mulch before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings in most cases [3425]. However, its effects on growth and cover are varied, with one study finding it increased the cover of target plant species, while another found it reduced the cover of planted species [3425]. A different study found that adding mulch did not alter the growth of seven different plant species [3425].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Other studies found that overall bat activity was higher in thinned forests compared to unthinned ones, particularly in forests thinned up to eight years prior or more than 20 years prior (991). However, thinning was found to increase the activity of some bat species but not others (991). One study recorded the same bat species in both thinned and unthinned forests, with the exception of the chocolate wattled bat, which was not found in areas with unthinned regrowth (991).\n\nForest creation and restoration have shown mixed results for reptile populations. In one Australian study, restored forest areas were found to have a higher reptile species richness and abundance than remnant forest areas (3749). Conversely, another study in Australia reported that the type of restoration had varied effects on reptile species richness in tropical and subtropical regions, and that different restoration types resulted in similar reptile abundance (3749). A separate study found that restored and natural riparian forests shared a similar level of reptile species richness (3749).\n\nThe retention of wildlife corridors in logged areas has been shown to be beneficial for certain species.
