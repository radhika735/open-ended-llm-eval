[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides direct physical removal, what alternative methods can be used to control problematic plants on peatlands?\nanswer: Alternative methods for controlling problematic plants on peatlands include the use of covers or barriers, grazing, physically damaging the plants, introducing other organisms, using herbicides, prescribed fire, cutting/mowing, and disturbing the peatland surface. However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of using covers/barriers, grazing, or physically damaging the plants (1775, 1773, 1769). One study found that introducing a parasitic plant could alter the plant community, reduce sedge cover, and increase moss cover and species richness (1777). Another study reported that herbicide application, along with other interventions, changed the plant community but could not prevent increases in shrub cover and prevented increases in plant species richness (1776). Prescribed fire has been shown to increase moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term, and lower heather cover, but it can also reduce or limit plant species richness (1774). The effects of cutting or mowing on plant communities were mixed, with some studies showing no significant effect and others reporting changes in community composition and increased cover of some desirable species like Sphagnum moss (1770, 1772). Finally, disturbing the peatland surface was found to affect plant community development, with one study noting an increase in weedy species (1811).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study reported the survival of some heather seedlings over a two-year period, whereas another noted that all germinated willow seedlings died within a month [1824]. In terms of shrub cover, two studies indicated that plots sown with shrub seeds developed greater cover of certain shrubs, but another study found that sown plots had similar overall shrub cover to unsown plots [1824]. For overall vegetation cover, two studies reported that plots sown with shrub seeds developed greater total vegetation cover than unsown plots, while another study reported no effect on total vegetation cover from sowing shrub seeds [1824]. The effect on plant species richness varied, with one study reporting an increase, another a decrease, and a third no effect [1824].\n\nWhen introducing seeds of herbaceous peatland plants, germination was reported in some cases [1823]. In three studies, wetland-characteristic or peatland-characteristic plants colonized plots where herb seeds were sown [1823]. Three studies found that plots sown with herb seeds developed cover of the sown herbs, while one study found that these plots had similar herb cover to plots that were not sown [1823]. The effect on overall vegetation cover was inconsistent: one study found an increase, another found no effect, and a third found that the effect depended on other treatments [1823]. Similarly, the effect on plant species richness was varied, with two studies finding no effect and two studies reporting inconsistent effects [1823].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

In terms of vegetation, mowing has been shown to alter the overall plant community composition (1759, 1771). Multiple studies found that mowing increased plant species richness (1759), with one study noting a greater increase in summer-mown plots compared to those mown in spring or autumn (1771). Mowing also increased the cover of plants characteristic of fens or wet meadows (1759) and, in some cases, increased total moss or bryophyte cover (1759). It was found to reduce the cover of certain herbs and shrubs (1759). The impact on vegetation structure, such as height and biomass, was mixed (1759), and one study reported that mown fen meadows had a similar vegetation structure to grazed meadows (1759). Regarding wildlife, one study found that fens managed by mowing had a higher species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (3950). However, recently cut fens, or fens cut in autumn or winter, had fewer large copper butterfly eggs and lower caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens (3950).
