Five of ten studies found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect on cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants (Action 1230). For young trees specifically, one study found wire fencing increased biomass, one found it decreased tree density, and one found mixed effects depending on species (Action 1230). Two replicated, controlled studies found that wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased tree density (Action 1230). Evidence for tree guards/shelters effectiveness: One replicated, randomized, controlled study found that using light colored plastic tree shelters (but not dark colored ones) increased the survival rate of planted tree seedlings (Action 1268). One replicated, controlled study found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 but not 44 months (Action 1268).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of removing competing understory vegetation on planted trees and overall forest biodiversity?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, removing competing understory vegetation has mixed effects on planted trees. Five studies found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on the emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One study found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased the growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). In freshwater wetlands, clearing vegetation before planting tree/shrub seedlings typically had no clear or significant effect on their height after 1-4 growing seasons, though one study found planted baldcypress seedlings were taller when planted amongst cut woody vegetation than below an uncleared canopy (Action 3334). For tree survival, clearing vegetation typically had no clear effect, though removing reed canarygrass before planting tree/shrub seedlings often increased survival rates (Action 3334).\n\nRegarding forest biodiversity effects, vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased the cover and diversity of understory plants while decreasing understory shrub cover (Action 1274). This combination also increased the density of young trees (Action 1274). Removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, and removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height (Action 1228). Tree thinning, which reduces competition, showed that 17 of 25 studies found increased density and cover of understory plants, while 13 of 19 studies found increased species richness and diversity of understory plants (Action 1211). Similarly, logging trees increased density and cover of understory plants in 5 of 10 studies, and increased species richness and diversity of understory plants in 4 of 7 studies (Action 1273).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In degraded forest areas, what interventions are available to improve soil conditions and enhance tree growth?\nanswer: Multiple interventions are available to improve soil conditions and enhance tree growth in degraded forest areas. Ground preparation before tree planting has shown positive effects, with six of seven studies finding that ground preparation treatments increased the survival and growth rate of planted trees (action 1263). Soil disturbance techniques include scarification or ploughing, where two of three studies found that ploughing increased the density of young trees, and two replicated controlled studies found mixed effects of tilling on different tree species (action 1251). Vegetation removal combined with mechanical soil disturbance increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and increased the density of young trees (action 1274).\n\nFertilizer application has demonstrated benefits, with six of eight studies finding that applying fertilizer increased total plant cover, understory plant biomass, size of young trees, and cover of seeded plant species (action 1248). Organic fertilizer shows specific advantages over inorganic fertilizer, with eight replicated studies finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer, and four studies finding more microbial biomass in soils with organic fertilizer (action 1366). Adding organic matter to soil shows mixed results, with one study finding that leaf litter addition increased species richness of young trees, and another study finding that adding plant material to the soil surface increased total plant cover (action 1250).\n\nSoil amendments using a mix of organic and inorganic materials have proven effective, with five controlled trials finding higher microbial biomass and activity in soils with mixed manure and inorganic fertilizers, and four trials finding more organic carbon in soils with mixed fertilizers (action 902). Formulated chemical compounds can also improve soil conditions, with five of six studies showing increased soil organic matter or carbon when nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer was applied (action 909). However, specific soil enhancers after tree planting showed mixed results, with different soil enhancers having mixed effects on tree seedling survival and height (action 1153). Mycorrhizal inoculation shows some promise, with studies finding that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before planting increased vegetation cover and height of certain plant species (action 3429).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the state of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of managing public access and tourism to mitigate human disturbance in forests?\nanswer: The evidence regarding the effectiveness of managing public access and tourism to mitigate human disturbance in forests is extremely limited. Most studies specifically examining forest contexts show no available evidence. One study from Spain (action 312) found that reducing visitor group size in forests resulted in fewer birds observed as visitor numbers increased, primarily due to decreases in collared dove and serin abundance. For path management, one UK study (action 311) found that two wader species nested closer to or at higher densities near a path following resurfacing that resulted in fewer people leaving the designated path. However, there is no evidence available for the effects of creating managed paths and signs to contain disturbance specifically in forests (action 1170). The broader literature on visitor management shows some positive evidence for restricting access: studies found that restricting access to protected areas resulted in higher populations of medium-sized and large mammals compared to unrestricted access areas, increased area use by grizzly bears and leopards, and reduced bear mortality (action 2330). One study showed that removing or closing roads increased area use by black bears (action 2325). However, many common visitor management strategies lack direct evaluation, with no studies found for restricting pedestrian access to natural areas (action 3022), creating designated recreational access points (action 2842), adopting ecotourism principles (action 3025), or using signs and access restrictions for amphibians (action 795).

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does the effectiveness of managing livestock grazing to protect forests vary across different geographical locations mentioned in the evidence?\nanswer: The effectiveness of managing livestock grazing to protect forests shows geographical variation across different regions. Studies on preventing livestock grazing in forests found that two of three studies in Brazil, UK and Costa Rica increased survival, species richness and diversity of understory plants, while one study found mixed effects (Action 1206). In Israel, preventing cattle grazing increased the density of oak seedlings and saplings (Action 1206). Wire fencing to exclude livestock from forest sections showed varied effectiveness across locations: four of eight studies in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, West Africa and the USA found increased biomass, species richness, density and cover of understory plants, while four studies found mixed effects or no effect (Action 1205). For tree regeneration specifically, three of four studies in Mexico, Kenya, Israel and Panama found that livestock exclusion increased the size and density of regenerating trees, while one study found decreased tree density but not tree size (Action 1205). Shortening grazing periods showed regional differences: one study in Spain found increased abundance and size of regenerating oak trees, one study in Australia found no effect on native plant species richness, and one study in the UK found higher numbers of tree seedlings following summer compared to winter grazing (Action 1208). Reducing grazing intensity also varied by location: studies in the UK found increased tree saplings and in Greece found increased understory biomass (Action 1207). Studies on ceasing livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna showed that two studies in each of Argentina and Australia and one in Mexico had mixed results for reptile species richness and abundance (Action 3511).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What management techniques involving tree removal can be used to increase forest structural diversity and what are their effects?\nanswer: Several management techniques involving tree removal can be used to increase forest structural diversity. Shelterwood harvesting is a technique where trees are removed gradually in multiple stages rather than all at once, and studies show this method results in higher plant diversity and higher density of tree species compared with clearcutting (action 1214). Additionally, shelterwood harvesting increases abundance, species richness and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival rate of young trees (action 1223). Selective logging is another technique where specific trees are removed rather than clearing large areas, and studies indicate this method can maintain similar reptile species richness compared to high intensity selective logging (action 3637). Reduced impact logging has smaller effects on wildlife abundance than conventional logging (action 989) and can maintain similar species richness and diversity to primary forest (action 3867). Tree thinning is a technique where the density of trees is reduced, and thinning by girdling increases understory plant species richness, diversity and cover (action 1226). Regular forest thinning can result in areas having similar reptile species richness compared to areas with no thinning, with some studies showing higher abundance of reptiles than areas with no thinning (action 3627). Patch retention harvesting retains small patches of trees during harvest operations and areas under this method contain more birds of more species than clearcut areas while retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas (action 330). Variable retention management, which leaves trees distributed across the harvest area rather than concentrated in patches, resulted in nine bird species occurring at higher densities compared to control stands (action 332). Post-wildfire thinning increases plant species richness and increases the cover of aspen saplings (action 1234).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Shelterwood harvesting shows mixed results across different taxa: for butterflies and moths, one study found higher macro-moth species richness compared to clearcutting (action ID 3871), another found moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after clearcutting (action ID 3871), while a third found similar moth species richness between shelterwood and clearcutting but lower than unharvested forest (action ID 3871). For salamanders, shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar abundance compared to clearcutting (action ID 851), with a meta-analysis finding that partial harvest including shelterwood resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 851). For plants, shelterwood harvesting in Sweden and USA resulted in higher plant diversity, lower grass cover, and higher density of tree species compared to clearcutting (action ID 1214), and generally increased abundance, species richness, and diversity of understory plants as well as growth and survival rate of young trees (action ID 1223). Partial retention harvesting in Canada decreased the density of young trees compared to clearcutting (action ID 1215). Selective harvesting showed mixed results for mammals, with one study finding no higher small mammal species richness compared to clearcutting (action ID 2637), while results for abundance varied by species and study, with a systematic review finding that partially harvested forests had more red-backed voles but not deer mice than clearcut forests (action ID 2637). Group harvesting studies found that compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance (action ID 844), though a meta-analysis found partial harvest methods including group harvesting resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (action ID 844).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For competition management, selective thinning after restoration planting can be used (action 1238), and mechanical thinning before or after planting has shown positive results in five of six studies across multiple countries, increasing survival and size of planted trees (action 1261). Ground preparation before tree planting has demonstrated effectiveness, with six of seven studies finding increased survival and growth rates of planted trees (action 1263).\n\nTo protect against vegetation competition, covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting can decrease the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses (action 1239), while covering with techniques other than plastic mats, such as mulch, increased total plant cover (action 1240). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting has shown mixed results, with some studies finding increased seedling numbers and target plant species cover (action 3425). Weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in one study (action 1267).\n\nFor physical protection, fences or barriers can be used to protect planted vegetation, particularly in wetland environments. Studies in freshwater wetlands found that fencing to exclude deer increased tree seedling height and sometimes improved survival, though effects varied by season, elevation, and site (action 3330). In brackish/saline wetlands, full-length plastic shelters increased survival rates and growth of red mangrove propagules (action 3331). Plastic guards increased height and diameter growth rates in baldcypress seedlings (action 3330).\n\nAdditional protection methods include using shading for planted trees, which increased survival rates of native tree seedlings in one study (action 1269).

Species richness of macro-moths was higher after shelterwood harvesting than after patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to thinned and unharvested forests (Action 3871). Moth species richness recovered faster after shelterwood harvesting than after group selection harvesting or clearcutting (Action 3871).\n\nGroup-selection harvesting showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased cover and diversity of understory plants and density of young trees, while others found decreased understory species richness and biomass, and still others found no effect on understory species richness and diversity or tree density and growth-rate (Action 1224). Forests managed by group selection harvesting had similar moth species richness to those managed by single tree harvesting or clearcutting, but lower species richness than unharvested forest (Action 3868).\n\nThinning instead of clearcutting resulted in higher macro-moth species richness compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forests (Action 3868).\n\nWoody debris removal produced variable effects: one study found it increased understory vegetation cover, while three studies found no effect or mixed effects on cover (Action 1213). Four studies found no effect or mixed effects on understory vegetation species richness and diversity, and two found no effect on cover and species diversity of trees (Action 1213). For young trees specifically, one study found debris removal increased young tree density, another found it decreased density, and three studies found mixed effects or no effect on young tree density (Action 1213).

Cutting and mowing can be specifically applied to control problematic herbaceous plants (Action 3106). Rotovating can be used to control grass vegetation (Action 1648). Physical damage to problematic plants through methods like ploughing and disking has been studied, with some studies finding that managed plots using cutting, disking and herbicide applications contained more non-planted tree seedlings than unmanaged plots (Action 3097).\n\nManual Weeding: Selective hand weeding can be used to manage vegetation (Action 3714). This involves physically removing competing plants by hand rather than using chemical treatments.\n\nProtective Materials: Weed mats can be used to protect planted trees from vegetation competition (Action 1267). Adding mulch before or after seeding/planting can help control competing vegetation, with some studies finding that mulch increased cover of target plant species and increased seedling numbers (Action 3425).\n\nSite Preparation: Removing vegetation before seeding/planting can improve establishment conditions, with studies showing this increased germination rates of sown species and increased seedling numbers for some species (Action 3416).\n\nThese methods provide physical barriers, mechanical removal, or site preparation alternatives to chemical herbicide applications for managing vegetation competition around seedlings and young trees.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Forest thinned up to 20 years previously had higher bat diversity than unthinned forest, though sites thinned more than 20 years previously did not differ. Forest thinned up to eight years previously or more than 20 years previously had higher bat activity than unthinned forest, but sites thinned 8-20 years previously did not differ. One study found the same bat species in thinned and unthinned forest, except for the chocolate wattled bat, which was not recorded in forests with unthinned regrowth.\n\n**Prescribed Fire Management:** Studies in Australia documented several effects of prescribed burning. In eucalyptus forest, selective burning resulted in fewer Eltham copper caterpillars in the spring following burning compared to before burning (Action 3877). Three studies in Australia found that prescribed burning in forest, open woodland and savanna had mixed effects on reptile populations (Action 3646). One study found that reptile abundance increased with time since burning, while others found similar reptile species richness in burned versus unburned areas. One study found that areas of woodland managed by burning and vegetation thinning had higher reptile species richness than unmanaged areas (Action 3655).\n\n**Burning Timing Effects:** One study in Australia found that in forest burned early in the dry season, northern brown bandicoot survival rate declined less than in forests burned late in the dry season (Action 2416).\n\n**Woody Debris Addition:** A randomised, replicated, controlled study from Australia found that brown treecreeper numbers were higher in plots with large amounts of dead wood added, compared to control plots or those with less debris added (Action 344).\n\n**Grazing Cessation:** Two studies in Australia examining the cessation of livestock grazing in forest, open woodland and savanna found mixed results for reptiles (Action 3511). Studies found that ungrazed and grazed areas had similar reptile species richness and diversity, though grazing had mixed effects on reptile abundance.\n\n**Combined Management Approaches:** Studies in Australia found that areas managed by burning in combination with vegetation cutting had mixed effects on reptile populations, with some showing similar abundance compared to burning only or unmanaged areas (Action 3655).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do mechanical removal and herbicide application compare in their effectiveness for controlling understory vegetation after tree planting?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, both mechanical removal and herbicide application show mixed effectiveness for controlling understory vegetation after tree planting. For mechanical removal after tree planting, five studies found no effect on emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one study found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass (Action 1256). One study found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256). For herbicide application after tree planting, two of three studies found that using herbicide increased the size of planted trees, while one study found no effect on tree size (Action 1262). One study found no effect of herbicide use on frost damage to planted Norway spruce seedlings (Action 1262). When vegetation removal is combined with mechanical soil disturbance, two studies found this increased cover and diversity of understory plants and decreased understory shrub cover, and one study found it increased density of young trees (Action 1274). Pre-planting herbicide application shows some promise, with studies finding it increased sown species richness and cover of sown grass species, and increased seedling emergence for five of eight wildflower species (Action 3418).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the observed effects of adding soil amendments or ground coverings, such as organic matter, lime, or straw, after tree planting?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, soil amendments and ground coverings after tree planting show varied effects:\n\n**Straw ground covering:** One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the Czech Republic found that covering the ground with straw increased the growth rate of planted trees and shrubs, while bark or fleece did not have this effect (Action 1266).\n\n**Organic matter amendments:** In freshwater wetlands, adding large amounts of compost to plots planted with tree seedlings resulted in plant communities characteristic of drier conditions and lower plant species richness and diversity after three years, while birch saplings were larger in plots with large amounts of compost compared to unamended plots (Action 3310). In brackish/saline wetlands, adding manure to plots planted with tree seedlings had mixed effects on survival and growth over three years, depending on the tree species and manure dose (Action 3311).\n\n**Surface mulching:** In freshwater wetlands, mulching with woodchips before planting native shrubs had no significant effect on overall cover, swamp gum cover, or seedling height after one year (Action 3314).\n\n**Lime application:** One of two replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA found that adding lime before restoration planting decreased the survival of pine seedlings, while the other study found no effect of adding lime on planted oak seedling growth (Action 1259).\n\n**Fresh plant material:** Addition of crop remains and straw showed increased microbial biomass, improved soil structure when straw was incorporated, and higher carbon levels when plant material was added to soil (Action 910).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA found that using light but not dark coloured plastic tree shelters increased the survival rate of planted tree seedlings (Action 1268). One replicated, controlled study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 but not 44 months (Action 1268). For wetland applications, one replicated, paired, controlled study in exposed coastal sites in the USA found that full-length plastic shelters increased the survival rate of planted red mangrove propagules over 4-8 months, but that full-length bamboo shelters and below-ground plastic shelters had no clear effect on survival (Action 3331). The same study found that red mangrove propagules planted within full-length plastic shelters had grown taller than propagules planted without shelter in three of four comparisons, made 22-129 days after planting (Action 3331). One replicated, randomized, controlled study in a nutria-invaded wetland in the USA found that planted baldcypress seedlings grew more over one growing season when protected than when left unprotected, with plastic guards increasing height and diameter growth rates (Action 3330).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
