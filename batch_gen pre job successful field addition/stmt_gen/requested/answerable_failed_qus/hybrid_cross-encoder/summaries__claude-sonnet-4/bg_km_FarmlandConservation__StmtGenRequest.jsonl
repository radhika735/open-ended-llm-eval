[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from multiple studies, the most beneficial actions for creating field margins to support wildlife on arable farms include several specific approaches. Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots provides benefits to target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, with increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, spiders, abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles, increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (Action 562). Creating uncultivated margins around intensive arable fields supports more invertebrates and higher plant diversity than conventionally managed field margins, with 19 studies finding they support more invertebrates (including bees) and/or higher plant diversity or species richness than conventional margins (Action 63). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mix, particularly with perennial leguminous flowering plants, attracts significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (Action 18). Planting grass buffer strips around arable fields increases butterfly species richness and abundance, with wider grass margins (up to 6m wide) having greater species richness of butterflies, macro-moths and micro-moths than narrower margins (Action 3982). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) results in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than sprayed headlands (Action 3898). Taking field corners out of management is positively correlated with grey partridge overwinter survival (Action 128). Reducing field size or maintaining smaller fields leads to higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and burnet moths compared to areas with larger fields (Action 3974).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of providing supplementary food versus cover for farmland birds during winter?\nanswer: Evidence from multiple studies shows both supplementary feeding and cover provision have benefits for farmland birds during winter, though with varying effectiveness. For supplementary feeding, nine studies from France, Sweden and the UK found that provision of supplementary food increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, body mass, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates, and increased overwinter survival of a declining house sparrow population (Action 648). Four studies found that farmland songbirds used supplementary food when provided, including targeted species such as tree sparrow, yellowhammer and corn bunting (Action 648). However, five studies found no clear effect of supplementary food provision on farmland bird breeding abundance, reproductive success, territory size, overwinter survival of stable house sparrow populations, or tree sparrow nest box use (Action 648). For cover provision, fourteen studies from the UK found that fields sown with wild bird cover mix had higher abundance, density, species diversity and species richness of birds than other farmland habitats (Action 594). Six studies found that birds showed a preference for wild bird cover and used it significantly more than other habitats, with one review finding grey partridge population increased substantially on farms where conservation measures including cover crops were in place (Action 594). Regarding overwinter stubbles specifically, eight studies found that at least some species or groups of farmland birds were positively associated with over-winter stubbles, with two studies reporting that seed-eating birds in particular were more abundant on stubbles (Action 203). However, mixed results were also reported, with some studies finding no preferential use of stubbles compared to cover crops, and effectiveness varying by species and management type (Actions 203, 695).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles?\nanswer: Several specific actions can be taken on farmland to support invertebrate populations like bees and beetles. Planting dedicated floral resources on farmland has shown substantial benefits, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants, particularly on patches sown with phacelia where all but one trial found substantial numbers of foraging wild bees and bumblebees, with six trials recording 8-35 bee species (Action ID: 17). Planting nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips has proven effective, with 80 individual studies investigating these strips and 64 showing benefits to wildlife groups, including 50 studies reporting positive effects on invertebrates with increased abundance and species richness (Action ID: 442).\n\nCreating beetle banks provides benefits to farmland biodiversity, with fourteen reports from eight studies finding positive effects on invertebrate densities, distribution, and higher ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between specific grass species and invertebrate groups (Action ID: 651). Managing the agricultural landscape to enhance floral resources shows promise, with one large replicated controlled trial demonstrating that long-tongued bumblebee abundance on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (Action ID: 362).\n\nReducing chemical inputs supports invertebrate populations, with studies on restricting certain pesticides showing that using specific fungicides reduced chick food insect abundance less than others (Action ID: 565). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use through organic farming methods has shown some benefits, with studies finding increased wood mouse abundance when pesticides were reduced, though effects varied by species (Action ID: 2539). Managing grassland through reduced cutting frequency benefits pollinators, with studies finding that meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and other pollinators compared to meadows cut two or more times per year (Action ID: 3961). Similarly, reducing grazing intensity by seasonal removal of livestock has shown benefits, with studies finding grasslands where cattle were removed in summer had higher abundance of butterflies and other pollinators than grasslands grazed throughout the summer (Action ID: 3960).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To benefit native farmland wildlife, what are the most effective methods for controlling invasive or problematic species?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, several methods for controlling invasive or problematic species on farmland have been evaluated with limited but specific findings. For controlling invasive non-native plants such as Himalayan Balsam and Japanese knotweed, removing all flower heads of giant hogweed plants at peak flowering time dramatically reduced seed production according to two randomized controlled trials in the Czech Republic (Action 104). Mechanical and manual removal of invasive plants showed mixed results - one study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while a study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, though a study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity and a Hawaii study found no effect on native species growth rate (Action 1228). Herbicide use to control invasive plant species showed no effect on total native plant species richness in one US study (Action 1229). Introducing parasitic organisms to control problematic plants showed promising results in one Belgian fen meadow study, where it altered plant community composition, reduced cover of dominant sedge, increased moss cover, and increased overall plant species richness (Action 1777). However, there is currently no evidence available for the effectiveness of managing wild deer numbers or controlling grey squirrels on farmland wildlife (Actions 111, 106). Similarly, no studies were found evaluating biological control or chemical biocides for managing invasive species in farmland contexts (Actions 2172, 2171).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the benefits and drawbacks of managing water levels and features like ditches and ponds on farmland to enhance biodiversity?\nanswer: Managing water levels and features like ditches and ponds on farmland shows both positive and negative effects for biodiversity enhancement. Benefits include increased invertebrate biomass or abundance, plant species richness, emergent plant cover, amphibian diversity and abundance, bird visit rates and higher numbers of some bird species from managing ditches under agri-environment schemes (Action 135). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers, breeding bird numbers, plant species that favour wet conditions, and invertebrate numbers or biomass in agricultural landscapes (Action 121). Additionally, higher plant diversity was found on ditch banks along unsprayed edges compared to those sprayed with pesticides (Action 135). For pond management, maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations or maintained newt populations (Action 833) and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action 833). However, drawbacks were also identified. Some studies found that ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants (Action 135). Raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species and did not affect lapwing foraging rate (Action 121). Unflooded pastures contained a high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates of importance to breeding wading birds (Action 121). Additionally, re-wetting soils on old arable fields was not an effective method of reducing nutrient levels and restoring species-rich grassland (Action 121). One study found that draining ponds, particularly in the summer, significantly increased abundance and numbers of amphibian species, suggesting that permanent water levels may not always be optimal (Action 833).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What conservation actions are available to support small mammal populations on European farmland?\nanswer: Several conservation actions are available to support small mammal populations on European farmland. Establishing wild flower areas on farmland has shown positive effects, with three of four studies in Switzerland, the UK, and Germany finding that sown wildflower areas contained more wood mice, small mammals, and common hamsters compared to grass and clover set-aside, grasslands, crops, uncultivated margins, agricultural areas, and crop fields (2359). Planting trees on farmland provides benefits, with two studies in the UK finding that farm woodland supported higher small mammal abundance than arable land or similar abundance compared to uncultivated field margins and set-aside (2386). Planting new or maintaining existing hedgerows shows promise, with a study in the UK finding that establishing hedgerows alongside arable land increased small mammal abundance (2383). Planting crops to provide supplementary food for mammals has demonstrated effectiveness, with studies in the UK and Spain finding that crops grown to provide food for wildlife resulted in higher abundance of small mammals in winter (2394). Reducing pesticide or fertilizer use can be beneficial, with one study in the UK finding that organic farming increased wood mouse abundance (2539). Reducing the intensity of grazing by domestic livestock has shown positive results, with six of nine studies in the USA, Denmark, the UK, China, Netherlands, and Norway finding that reductions in livestock grazing intensity were associated with increases in abundances of small mammals (2408). However, some interventions showed mixed or no effects: providing or retaining set-aside areas showed three studies in the UK and Switzerland finding that set-aside did not enhance small mammal numbers relative to cropland or to uncultivated field margins and farm woodland (2377).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Direct nest protection measures include protecting individual nests of ground-nesting birds using nest exclosures, which provided higher average daily survival rates for both common redshank and northern lapwing (Action 108), and marking bird nests during harvest or mowing, where marked northern lapwing nests were less likely to fail as a result of farming operations (Action 148).\n\nHabitat creation through specialized plots is highly effective. Creating skylark plots increased skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success and reduced the likelihood of skylarks abandoning their territory, with studies from the UK and Switzerland showing positive effects (Actions 540, 214). Leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (including 'lapwing plots') provided benefits including increased northern lapwing hatching success and Eurasian skylark nesting success, with northern lapwing, Eurasian skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail breeding in lapwing plots (Actions 562, 213).\n\nGrassland management practices include raising mowing height on grasslands, which provided benefits to Eurasian skylark including increased productivity (Action 138), and creating open patches or strips in permanent grassland, where more Eurasian skylarks used fields with open strips (Action 239).\n\nCrop management techniques include planting crops in spring rather than autumn, which resulted in higher numbers of farmland birds, with northern lapwings nesting on spring-sown crops more than expected and Eurasian skylarks using winter and spring sown crops for different broods (Action 137). Undersowing spring cereals with clover increased densities of singing Eurasian skylark and benefited various farmland wildlife (Action 136).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of creating or managing linear features like hedges and beetle banks for farmland wildlife?\nanswer: Evidence shows that linear features like hedges and beetle banks provide varying benefits to farmland wildlife. For beetle banks, studies found positive effects on invertebrate densities and ground beetle density and species diversity in spring and summer, though effects varied between specific grass species and invertebrate groups (Action 651). Beetle banks also supported higher densities of harvest mouse nests compared to field margins (Actions 2393, 651). However, some studies found lower or no difference in invertebrate densities on beetle banks relative to other habitats (Action 651). For birds, beetle banks showed mixed results - some evidence indicated birds used beetle banks and positive effects when combined with other conservation measures, while other studies found no farmland bird species associated with beetle banks (Action 651). Studies on butterflies and moths found that beetle banks had lower species richness of butterflies compared to hedgerows (Action 3927).\n\nFor hedgerows, evidence demonstrates stronger benefits. Newly planted hedges showed higher abundance, species richness and diversity of beetles and spiders compared to crop fields or field margins (Action 538). Established hedgerows had higher species richness of butterflies and macro-moths than beetle banks, crops or pasture (Action 3976). The abundance of butterflies, moths and macro-moths was higher along hedgerows than on beetle banks, grass margins, or field interiors (Action 3976). Hedgerows also increased small mammal abundance when established alongside arable land (Action 2383). For reptiles, cultivated areas with hedges had reptile communities more similar to forests than areas without hedges (Action 3519). Additionally, hedges trimmed three or more years prior had more bat species and higher activity of certain bat species than recently trimmed hedges (Action 1943).\n\nField margins provided additional evidence - uncropped cultivated margins benefited target farmland bird species, plants, invertebrates and mammals, including increased species richness and abundance across multiple taxa (Action 562).

From action 704, fifteen studies found benefits to birds, plants or invertebrates from reducing grazing intensity on permanent grassland, including increased plant abundance and diversity, increased invertebrate diversity, and benefits to breeding Eurasian skylark. Six studies specifically found that excluding or delaying summer grazing increased plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and benefited breeding Eurasian skylark. From action 3960, three controlled studies found that grasslands where cattle or sheep were removed seasonally had higher abundance of butterflies, other pollinators, and caterpillars than grasslands grazed throughout the season.

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of different mowing management strategies\u2014such as timing, height, and technique\u2014on farmland wildlife?\nanswer: Different mowing management strategies have varying effects on farmland wildlife across multiple species groups. Regarding mowing height, raised mowing heights benefit some species including Eurasian skylark with increased productivity and are less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (Action 138). However, northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). For mowing techniques, specific techniques can reduce mortality or injury in birds, mammals, amphibians, and invertebrates (Action 698). Changing mowing patterns reduces chick mortality - 68% of corncrake chicks escaped when fields were mown from center outwards compared to 45% during conventional edge-inward mowing (Action 698). Different machinery types have varying impacts: bar mowers and double chop mowers cause less damage to amphibians and invertebrates than other types, while rotary disc mowers with conditioners kill twice as many small mammals compared to double blade mowers. Skylark chick survival was four times higher when wider mowing machinery was used (Action 698). Regarding timing, delayed mowing benefits various species groups. The UK corncrake population increased following initiatives to delay mowing (Action 223, 131, 192). Delaying mowing dates resulted in higher plant species richness, more insect species and individuals visiting flowers, greater abundance of some spiders and ground beetles, increased breeding wading bird densities, and increased Eurasian skylark productivity (Action 131). However, some studies found no clear effects on plant species richness, ground beetle communities, or abundance of some insects and spiders (Action 131). Rotational mowing strategies also show benefits: grasslands managed by mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut had greater species richness and diversity of butterflies than grasslands cut in full once per year (Action 3966). Reducing cutting frequency can be beneficial, with meadows cut once per year having higher species richness of butterflies and moths than meadows cut multiple times per year (Action 3961). Seasonal timing effects vary, with cutting in different seasons having different impacts on individual plant species abundance in freshwater marshes (Action 3070).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For invasive non-native plants, mechanical control includes removing all flower heads at peak flowering time, which dramatically reduces seed production in giant hogweed (action 104). Physical removal methods include cutting invasive plants to similar heights as native plants, weeding, cutting and applying herbicide, with some studies showing these methods increase butterfly species richness and abundance (action 3890). Hand weeding and selective vegetation management are also effective approaches (action 3714).\n\nFor bracken control specifically, multiple methods are available. Herbicide application using asulam reduces bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, with studies showing it increases heather seedlings and biomass, plant species number, and cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue while reducing bracken biomass and cover (action 1652). Cutting bracken increases heather cover or biomass and species richness of heathland plants, while also increasing cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue and reducing bracken cover or biomass (action 1653). A combined approach of cutting and applying herbicide reduces bracken biomass or cover and increases plant species richness when cutting is followed by herbicide application compared to herbicide followed by cutting (action 1654). However, cutting may be equally effective to repeated herbicide application according to systematic review findings (action 105).\n\nAdditional control methods include using grass-specific herbicides that reduce grass diversity while increasing broadleaved plants, cutting and infection with fungal pathogens for controlling creeping thistle, and lenient grazing for long-term control (action 123). The herbicide asulam is noted to reduce bracken abundance but may affect associated moss species when exposed over three weeks (action 105).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Regarding wide-spaced rows in cereals, one UK study found this offered benefits over conventional wheat for Eurasian skylarks, though another found fields with wide-spaced rows had fewer skylark nests than control or skylark plot fields (actions 216, 564). Creating open patches or strips in permanent grassland showed that more Eurasian skylarks used fields with open strips, though variations in skylark numbers were too great to draw conclusions (action 239).

Nineteen studies found that grass buffer strips increased arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity (action 246). Nine studies found benefits for birds including increased numbers, densities, species richness and foraging time (action 246). Seven studies found increased plant cover and species richness (action 246). Five studies found benefits for small mammals including increased activity and numbers (action 246). However, some studies found no clear effects on insect numbers, bird numbers or invertebrate pest populations (action 246).\n\n**Riparian Buffer Strips**: Provide buffer strips alongside water courses (action 120), with three studies reporting positive influence on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance. However, two studies found no increase in plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips.\n\n**Beetle Banks**: Create raised beetle banks in arable fields (actions 651, 3927, 2393), with fourteen reports from eight studies finding some benefits to farmland biodiversity (action 651). Effects include positive impacts on invertebrate densities and ground beetle diversity, evidence of bird usage, and provision of nest sites for harvest mice (action 651). One study found higher densities of harvest mouse nests on beetle banks than field margins (action 2393).\n\n**Conservation Headlands**: Leave headlands unsprayed (actions 3898, 29), with studies showing increased butterfly species richness and abundance in unsprayed headlands compared to sprayed ones (action 3898). However, conservation headlands do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (action 29).\n\n**Uncultivated Margins**: Create uncultivated margins around fields (action 3518), with studies finding that uncultivated field margins were used by slow worms, common lizards and grass snakes, though revegetated linear strips had similar reptile species richness and abundance to other strip types.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: As an alternative to leaving overwinter stubbles in UK cereal fields, what other in-field management options are available to benefit seed-eating birds and other wildlife?\nanswer: Several in-field management alternatives to overwinter stubbles are available for UK cereal fields to benefit seed-eating birds and other wildlife. Creating skylark plots within cereal fields shows positive effects, with studies finding increases in skylark population size, breeding density, duration or success, and benefits to plants and invertebrates (Action 540). Undersowing spring cereals with clover benefits some birds, plants, insects, spiders and earthworms, including increases in Eurasian skylark density and nesting dunnock, arthropod abundance and species richness, and bumblebee, butterfly, earthworm, ground beetle, spider or springtail abundances (Action 136). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture shows strong evidence of effectiveness, with studies finding higher bird diversity, densities, abundances, nesting densities, and higher productivities for some species compared to other habitats (Action 187). Sowing crops in spring rather than autumn provides benefits, with studies finding more bird species on areas with spring sown cereals compared with winter cereals, and population increases after the start of spring sowing (Action 207). Conservation headlands (leaving headlands unsprayed) are frequently used by bird species and show higher grey partridge chick and adult survival, with larger broods on farms with conservation headlands (Action 461). Creating beetle banks provides habitat that holds more invertebrate predators than surrounding crops, which can benefit the wider food web (Action 729). However, evidence for some options is limited - no evidence was found for the effects of leaving unharvested cereal headlands on bird populations (Actions 206, 646), and planting cereals in wide-spaced rows showed mixed results with lower invertebrate abundances and fewer skylark nests but increased nestling body condition (Action 564).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the observed effects of introducing flower-rich habitats, such as nectar mixes or nettle strips, into arable field margins?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, introducing flower-rich habitats into arable field margins produces several documented effects across different wildlife groups. For butterflies and moths, 23 studies showed that nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips had higher species richness and diversity than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Ten studies found higher abundance of butterflies including generalist, specialist, and meadow brown butterflies in sown wildflower strips compared to conventional margins and cropped fields (Action 3932). For bees, five replicated trials demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Four trials showed that field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species (Action 19). For birds, four replicated controlled studies found that plots sown with wildflower or legume seed mix attracted more birds or bird species, with Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraging and nesting in sown weed patches (Action 442). All five studies investigating wildflower strips effects on small mammals found increases in abundance, density and species richness (Action 442). For nettle strips specifically, a study from Belgium found that planting nettle strips in arable field margins resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118). Overall, 80 individual studies investigating flowering strips showed that 64 demonstrated some benefits to one or more wildlife groups, with 50 of 65 studies on invertebrates reporting positive effects (Action 442).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
