Combined mesh escape panels with size-sorting grids showed strong results, with 4 of 5 studies finding reduced unwanted catch of fish, sharks and stingrays compared to standard unmodified trawl nets (Action 2727). Size-sorting escape grids with large escape openings were effective, with 3 of 4 studies finding reduced catches of unwanted fish and sharks and rays compared to standard trawl nets (Action 2726).\n\nMesh modifications: Square mesh codends demonstrated effectiveness in 10 of 16 studies, reducing unwanted catches of all monitored fish species, young individuals of commercially targeted fish, total unwanted catch, and discarded fish compared to diamond mesh codends (Action 2714). Mesh escape panels/windows showed positive results, with 15 of 30 studies finding reduced unwanted catches of various fish species compared to standard diamond mesh trawl nets (Action 2716). Size-sorting mesh funnels in shrimp trawls were effective in all 3 studies, reducing catches of unwanted non-commercial or discarded fish compared to standard trawls (Action 2722).\n\nPhysical gear modifications: Topless (coverless) trawls showed effectiveness in 2 of 4 studies, reducing catch of unwanted Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species compared to conventional trawl types (Action 2712). Bottom trawls with parts raised off the seabed were effective in both studies examined, catching fewer unwanted sharks, elasmobranchs and fish compared to conventional trawls (Action 2708). Removing tickler chains showed effectiveness in 1 of 2 studies, reducing catches of non-commercial target skates/rays and sharks while keeping commercial target species catches typically unaffected (Action 2709).\n\nArtificial lighting: Artificial lights on fishing gear showed limited effectiveness, with only 1 study finding that shrimp trawl nets with lights caught fewer unwanted fish when fitted to the fishing line compared to conventional trawl (Action 2695).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study in the Pacific Ocean found that co-management systems showed no decrease in overall fishing effort in the managed area five years after implementation (Action 2910). Similarly, territorial fishing use rights showed no decrease in overall fishing effort in the five years after implementation in the Pacific Ocean (Action 2677). However, move-on rules that establish temporary fishing restrictions when catch thresholds are reached showed more promising results, with two studies in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea finding that fishing effort for cod and blue ling was reduced after implementation (Action 3815). Overall catch limits showed variable effects on fishing effort, with one study in the North Sea finding that when annual total allowable catch limits were changed, half of the otter trawl fleet had corresponding changes in fishing effort, but there were no changes for the beam trawl fleet (Action 3811).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What actions are available to protect the reproductive success of commercially fished species?\nanswer: Several actions are available to protect the reproductive success of commercially fished species. Protecting spawning fish from capture can safeguard reproduction directly, with studies showing that spawning and nursery areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning (Action ID: 2938). Setting a minimum landing size for commercially fished species can protect immature fish before they have the opportunity to reproduce, though one global review found that only one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after setting recommended minimum landing sizes, while one study reported that most fish in commercial catches were still immature despite established minimum sizes (Action ID: 2735). \n\nTemporal restrictions include establishing temporary fishery closures, where tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside a seasonally closed spawning area, providing increased protection during the spawning period (Action ID: 2664). Long-term fishery closures can also protect fish populations, with studies showing higher abundance of young salmon and improved weights of young salmon returning to rivers in the five years after closure of a commercial coastal fishery (Action ID: 2655). Establishing territorial user rights for fisheries demonstrated benefits for reproductive success, with one study finding larger-sized and more numerous egg capsules, and more larvae of Chilean abalone up to 21 months after establishing fishing restrictions compared to open-access areas (Action ID: 2104).\n\nGear modifications can reduce capture of juvenile fish before they reach reproductive maturity. Using larger mesh sizes in fishing nets improved size-selectivity and reduced catches of unwanted small/undersized fish in 15 of 20 studies across multiple marine regions, allowing juvenile fish to escape and reach reproductive age (Action ID: 2697). Marine Protected Areas that prohibit commercial fishing can protect both spawning grounds and nursery areas, though effectiveness varies by species and implementation (Action ID: 2225).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the conservation benefits of prohibiting spearfishing in marine reserves in the Mediterranean?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, prohibiting spearfishing in marine reserves in the Mediterranean provides several conservation benefits for fish populations. Two studies in the Mediterranean Sea (France, Corsica) found that prohibiting spearfishing and line fishing in protected areas increased the abundances of European seabass and gilthead seabream compared to protected and unprotected fished areas after two to seven years (action 2672). The same studies found that European seabass were larger in size in areas where spearfishing was prohibited compared to protected and unprotected fished areas after two to seven years (action 2672). Additionally, one study in the Mediterranean Sea found that prohibiting spearfishing in specific zones of a marine reserve resulted in higher commercial and recreational fishery catches of targeted common dentex compared to zones that allowed spearfishing and areas outside the reserve after one to three years (action 2672). More broadly, studies from the Mediterranean Sea showed that marine protected areas prohibiting all types of fishing for between three and 16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas (action 2682). Several Mediterranean studies found that marine protected areas that had prohibited all fishing for between one to more than 25 years had higher fish species richness compared to fished areas (action 2682). Mediterranean studies also found higher abundances and biomasses of all fish, fishery targeted fish species, and individual fish species in marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years compared to unprotected fished areas (action 2682). Fish in non-fished Mediterranean marine reserves were found to be larger overall and had larger individuals of monitored fish species compared to fished areas after one to 22 years (action 2682). One Mediterranean study found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve (action 2682).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects on marine fish populations of prohibiting different types of bottom fishing gear?\nanswer: Studies examining the prohibition of different types of bottom fishing gear show varied effects on marine fish populations. Prohibiting all mobile and static fishing gears that catch bottom species showed mixed results: one study found higher numbers of larger and older cod after 15 years of prohibition, while another found no effect on fish densities after 2-7 years (Action 2654). For fish condition, cod showed better growth in closed areas after 5-15 years compared to openly fished areas (Action 2654).\n\nProhibiting mobile fishing gears dragged across the seafloor (bottom trawling) had variable effects on fish abundance across studies. Two studies found increased total fish biomass after 15 years and higher biomass of adult red mullet after 14 years, while two other studies found no effect on bottom-dwelling fish abundance after 5 and 10 years of prohibition (Action 2673). For reproductive success, red mullet recruitment increased after 14 years of closure, but haddock recruitment showed no improvement after 7 years (Action 2673). Fish size responses varied: adult red mullet were larger 14 years after closure, but overall fish size effects were mixed across studies and varied by fish group and habitat type (Action 2673).\n\nProhibiting shellfish dredging specifically showed no effect on bottom-dwelling fish species richness or abundance after 10 years in one North Sea study (Action 2668). Semi-pelagic trawl use instead of bottom trawl reduced commercial fish catch abundance compared to demersal trawling (Action 2118). Areas allowing only hook and line fishing showed greater increases in lobster abundance and size over 4 years compared to fully fished sites (Action 2233).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are some alternatives to setting catch quotas for controlling fishing mortality?\nanswer: Several alternatives to setting catch quotas exist for controlling fishing mortality. Effort controls include limiting the number of fishing days (3804), which showed higher biomass of thornback and brown rays in the Mediterranean Sea following a decrease in overall number of days fished by a bottom trawl fleet. Vessel restrictions can limit fishing activity by vessel size and/or engine power (3809), which in the North Sea resulted in higher abundance of commercially targeted fish after vessels with higher engine power were excluded from an area for half of each year. Licensing systems can limit the number of fishing permits/licences to limit vessel or fisher numbers (3817), though no studies were found evaluating this approach.\n\nTechnical measures include prohibiting certain gear types (3810), which showed higher fish density in areas where all but one gear type was prohibited compared to areas with fewer restrictions or unrestricted areas. Using larger mesh sizes (2697) can reduce unwanted catch and improve size-selectivity, with studies showing that larger mesh sizes reduced catches of unwanted fish in most cases and improved size-selectivity for all fish species assessed. Limiting or prohibiting specific fishing methods (3546) has also been implemented, though limited evidence exists.\n\nSpatial and temporal restrictions include establishing temporary fishery closures (3545) and long-term fishery closures (2655), with the latter showing varied results including higher abundance of some fish species and reduced flight response distance in closed areas. Move-on rules that establish temporary fishing restrictions when catch thresholds are reached (3815) have reduced cod discards and fishing effort.\n\nRights-based management alternatives include catch shares systems. Introducing catch shares (3812) showed that fisheries managed under catch shares were more likely to meet biomass sustainability targets and had lower rates of over-exploitation compared to non-catch share fisheries. Setting catch shares by species (3814) reduced unwanted halibut catch in a multi-species fishery compared to previous systems.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What does the evidence say about how different fishing practices affect the survival of fish after capture and release?\nanswer: The evidence shows that different fishing practices significantly affect fish survival after capture and release. Hook and line fishing provides greater fish vitality (an indicator of post-release survival) compared to other gear types (Action 2732). Survival rates vary considerably by species and capture conditions, with studies showing that 76-92% of unwanted small-spotted catshark, thorny skate, pearl perch, and Atlantic wolffish survived for 1 hour to 5 days after capture and release, while less than half of smooth skate survived (Action 2691). Nearly all yelloweye rockfish survived for four days after capture and release, but canary rockfish survival decreased with increasing capture depth (Action 2691). \n\nHook type affects survival outcomes - four of seven studies found that using different hook types in longline or recreational fisheries reduced fish hook injuries associated with higher post-release mortality and reduced capture mortality of some unwanted shark and ray species compared to conventional hooks, although other studies found no reduction in post-release mortality for certain species like young sea breams (Action 2698). Circle hooks specifically show mixed survival effects - two studies found similar survival rates for sea turtles caught by circle hooks versus J-hooks, while one review found fewer sea turtle deaths when circle hooks were used in four of five fisheries (Action 3559).\n\nSurvival is negatively affected by hooking/capture depth injuries and longer tow durations (Action 2691). Longline configuration modifications also impact survival - nylon hook attachment lines showed higher survival for unwanted sharks and rays compared to wire for two of three species, though one study found reduced survival with nylon hook lines (Action 2699). Different bait types did not increase survival of sharks and rays on gear retrieval according to one global systematic review (Action 2700).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How do the effects of prohibiting all commercial fishing on fish abundance vary across different ocean basins?\nanswer: Based on the action documents examined, the effects of prohibiting all commercial fishing on fish abundance show considerable variation across different ocean basins. In the Tasman Sea (Australia), studies found mixed results with most fish species in an estuary showing lower abundance two years after commercial fishing closure, while another study found fish abundance varied over 10 years and was higher for some groups compared to areas open to fishing (Action ID: 2667). In the Indian Ocean (Australia), areas banning all commercial fishing for five years showed higher abundances of three of 12 commercially targeted and non-targeted fish species compared to unprotected fished areas, and overall fish size was bigger (Action ID: 2667). In the Mediterranean Sea (Spain), studies showed no increase in white seabream and gilthead bream biomass 2-13 years after closure compared to unprotected fished areas (Action ID: 2667). In the South Atlantic Ocean (South Africa), a reserve closed to all commercial fishing for 40 years showed mixed effects, with higher abundances of five of five commercially exploited species but no change in species composition compared to fished areas (Action ID: 2667). The Gulf of Mexico (USA) showed higher abundances of one of four commercially targeted fish species in protected areas (Action ID: 2667). In the South China Sea (China), overall fish density in the wider region increased in the five years after creation of marine reserves with commercial fishing limits (Action ID: 2667). More comprehensive studies across multiple ocean basins found that marine protected areas prohibiting all fishing for up to 25+ years generally had higher fish abundances, with effects varying between fish species, food chain position, commercial target status, fish sizes, depth, and habitat types (Action ID: 2682). Studies spanning the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Sulu Sea found that 30 of 54 studies showed higher abundances in protected areas, while 8 showed similar abundances and 16 showed mixed effects depending on species characteristics (Action ID: 2682).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective non-gear-modification strategies for reducing unwanted fish catch?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, several non-gear-modification strategies have been evaluated for reducing unwanted fish catch (bycatch). Establishing move-on rules for temporary, targeted fishing restrictions or closures when a catch or unwanted catch threshold is reached showed effectiveness, with one study finding lower overall cod discards after implementation (action 3815). Setting catch limits or quotas for non-targeted commercial catch was found to reduce unwanted catch in two of three cases according to a review, and one study found that catch limits for non-target commercial species reduced the amount of unwanted halibut (action 2693). Temporary fishery closures demonstrated benefits for turtle populations, with one study finding fewer lethal strandings of loggerhead and Kemp's ridley turtles during seasonal shrimp trawling closures (action 3545). Technology to communicate near real-time catch information to fishers showed promise, with reductions of unwanted catch or discards reported in two of three cases (action 3826). However, prohibiting high grading (landing only the most profitable individuals or species) did not eliminate the discarding of legal-sized but unwanted fish in one study (action 3823). For several other strategies including human observers onboard fishing vessels, vessel monitoring systems, promoting seafood certification, and legislating mandatory landing of all quota species catch, no studies were found that directly evaluated their effects on reducing unwanted catch.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Protecting spawning fish from capture is a direct management approach that involves seasonal fishery closures to protect spawning individuals, with studies showing that spawning areas closed seasonally or permanently to fishing were used by tagged adult Atlantic cod for nearly a third of time during spawning (Action ID: 2938). Releasing males of species known to guard nests during breeding season is another targeted approach, though no studies have yet evaluated its effects on marine fish populations (Action ID: 2734).\n\nEstablishing temporary fishery closures provides broader protection, with studies showing that tagged adult cod spent nearly a third of time inside seasonally closed spawning areas during implementation, providing increased protection from fishing gears during the spawning period (Action ID: 2664). Setting minimum landing sizes for commercially fished species helps protect immature fish before they reach reproductive maturity, though one study reported that despite established minimum sizes, most fish landed in commercial catches were immature and had never spawned (Action ID: 2735).\n\nAdditional management approaches include allowing periodic fishing only, with one study finding that protected areas fished only for short periods had greater biomass than openly fished areas and similar fish biomass as areas permanently closed to fishing (Action ID: 2679). Size range specifications and maximum landing size limits are also available management tools, though no studies have yet evaluated their specific effects on fish reproductive capacity (Action IDs: 2737, 2736).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Overall catch limits or quotas by fishery or fleet can decrease fishing mortality and improve fish survival, with studies showing faster biomass increases for overfished tuna and billfish stocks when managed using catch limits compared to other controls (action 3811). Setting catch limits or quotas for non-targeted commercial catch reduced unwanted catch in two of three cases and reduced the amount of unwanted halibut (action 2693). Multi-year or long-term management strategies showed that commercial fisheries with long-term management plans had stocks that were more likely to be sustainable and less likely to be in decline compared to fisheries without long-term objectives (action 3825). Gear modifications can also reduce fishing mortality by minimizing unwanted catch: fitting size-sorting mesh funnels (sieve nets) to prawn/shrimp trawl nets reduced catches of unwanted fish compared to standard trawls (action 2722), modifying bottom trawls to raise parts of the gear off the seabed caught fewer unwanted sharks and other fish (action 2708), and fitting size-sorting escape grids and large escape openings to trawl nets reduced catches of unwanted fish and sharks in three of four studies (action 2726).

Action 2680 demonstrates that restricting unspecified fishing activity in marine protected areas can result in higher fish abundance, survival, and larger average sizes compared to unprotected areas. Action 2674 shows that controlling human activity with a zonation system of restrictions allows for different levels of fishing restrictions across zones, with studies finding higher fish species richness, abundance, and larger sizes in zones where fishing is more restricted compared to zones with fewer restrictions. Action 2239 indicates that marine protected areas can introduce some unspecified fishing restrictions while still allowing certain types of fishing activity. Action 2230 establishes that zonation systems can designate different areas with varying activity restrictions, allowing some fishing in certain zones while prohibiting it in others, with studies showing varied effectiveness for different species depending on protection levels. Action 3546 demonstrates that limiting or prohibiting specific fishing methods rather than all fishing can be effective. Action 3545 shows that establishing temporary fishery closures provides time-limited restrictions rather than permanent bans.

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Which modifications to trawl nets appear most effective for improving size-selectivity?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several trawl net modifications appear effective for improving size-selectivity:\n\n**Mesh Orientation Changes**: Rotating the orientation of diamond mesh in trawl codends by 90\u00b0 improved size selection of cod, red mullet, common pandora, and round-bodied fish species, though not for plaice, annular sea bream, and flatfish species (Action 2715).\n\n**Twine Modifications**: Using different twine types (varying thickness and construction material) improved size-selectivity of bottom fish, haddock, Atlantic cod, plaice, and flounder compared to thinner or other twine materials, with selectivity influenced by twine number and mesh orientation (Action 2710).\n\n**Square Mesh Codends Combined with Escape Panels**: Using square mesh escape panels with square mesh codends reduced unwanted finfish catch compared to diamond mesh codends (Action 2724), and improved size-selectivity of whiting when combined with size-sorting grids (Action 2727).\n\n**Size-Sorting Escape Grids**: Fitting size-sorting escape grids (rigid or flexible) to trawl nets improved size-selection of haddock, though not for saithe or cod, compared to standard nets without grids (Action 2720). When combined with square mesh codends, these grids reduced unwanted catch of whiting, plaice, cod, and haddock compared to diamond mesh codends (Action 2725).\n\n**Escape Panel Configuration**: Modifying the position and/or size of mesh escape panels improved size-selectivity of haddock and whiting, though increasing mesh size of panels had no effect on haddock selectivity and results were mixed for cod (Action 2717).\n\n**General Trawl Design Modifications**: Various modifications including changes to extension piece length, codend strengthening bags, weaving methods, number of codend layers, and overall design improved size-selectivity for unwanted fish species and sizes compared to standard trawl gear (Action 2704).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented effects of different restrictions on line fishing, such as prohibitions or gear modifications, on fish populations and unwanted catch?\nanswer: Based on the documented evidence, different restrictions on line fishing show varying effects on fish populations and unwanted catch. Prohibiting line fishing altogether has shown positive effects on fish populations - one study found that prohibiting offshore line fishing and all other boat-based fishing in a marine protected area resulted in higher abundances of four of four fish species over-exploited by line fishing, and these species were also larger in size compared to areas where fishing was permitted (Action 2671). Prohibiting certain gear types generally reduces unwanted catch - a study in the Kattegat found that prohibiting non-selective gear types combined with fishery closures reduced unwanted catch of cod, and another study in the Indian Ocean found higher fish density in areas where all but one gear type was prohibited compared to areas with fewer restrictions (Action 3810).\n\nRegarding gear modifications, longline configuration changes show mixed results for unwanted catch reduction. Modifying longline configuration such as increasing lead weights or using nylon instead of wire hook attachments reduced unwanted shark and ray catches in some cases but not others, with one review finding reductions in one of two cases examined. Survival rates of unwanted sharks and rays varied depending on the modification - nylon hook attachments showed higher survival for two of three species but lower survival for one species compared to wire attachments (Action 2699). Different bait types had inconsistent effects - six of eight studies found that using different bait types reduced unwanted catches of various species including undersized haddock and Atlantic cod, while two studies found no reduction in unwanted catches, and global reviews found no effect on unwanted shark and ray catches (Action 2700).\n\nGillnet modifications showed promising results for reducing unwanted catch - three of four studies found that modifications including reduced height, increased mesh size, and changes in twine diameter reduced unwanted catch of cod, discarded commercial and non-commercial species, though one study found no reduction in unwanted shark catches (Action 2701). Additional gear modifications like escape grids and panels in trawl nets also showed effectiveness, with three of four studies finding reduced unwanted fish and shark catches when these devices were fitted to nets (Action 2726).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: In prawn and shrimp trawl fisheries, what gear modifications are available to reduce the unwanted catch of fish?\nanswer: Several gear modifications are available for prawn and shrimp trawl fisheries to reduce unwanted fish catch. Size-sorting escape grids (rigid or flexible) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets have been extensively tested, with 30 studies showing that seven of seven replicated studies found these grids reduced unwanted fish catches by allowing escape of unwanted sharks and other fish species (Action 2721). Size-sorting mesh funnels (sieve nets) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets reduced catches of unwanted fish compared to standard trawls in three replicated studies in the North Sea (Action 2722). Large, supported escape openings such as Fisheyes, Bigeyes and radial escape sections fitted to trawl nets reduced overall catches of unwanted fish, immature red snapper and total unwanted catch in six of seven replicated studies (Action 2723). Combinations of size-sorting escape grids and large supported escape openings reduced catches of unwanted fish and sharks and rays in three of four studies (Action 2726). Modified W-trawl net designs used in shrimp/prawn fisheries caught less non-commercial unwanted catch of crustaceans compared to traditional Florida Flyer trawl nets (Action 2139). Topless (coverless) trawls reduced unwanted catches in two of four studies, with reductions in Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species (Action 2712). Bottom trawls with parts of the gear raised off the seabed caught fewer unwanted sharks, other elasmobranchs and fish compared to conventional trawls (Action 2708). Mesh escape panels/windows with square mesh instead of diamond mesh codends reduced numbers of discarded finfish (Action 2724), and modifications to the configuration of mesh escape panels reduced unwanted catches in three of five studies (Action 2717).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective modifications for static fishing gear, like gillnets and traps, to reduce unwanted fish catch?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from multiple studies, several modifications to static fishing gear have proven effective at reducing unwanted catch. For gillnets, modifications including reduced height, increased tension, twine diameter, and mesh size and orientation successfully reduced unwanted catch of cod in one of two net designs, discarded fish of commercial and non-commercial species, and discards of non-commercial species compared to conventional configurations, though one study found gillnet modifications did not typically reduce unwanted shark catches (Action 2701). For fishing traps and pots, the most effective modifications include: increasing mesh size, which reduced unwanted catches of fish overall and improved size-selectivity for multiple species including Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most fish species, and specifically reduced unwanted undersized mud crabs (Actions 2702, 2148); fitting escape devices such as soft, semi-rigid, or rigid grids or frames, which reduced unwanted undersized mud crabs (Actions 2146, 2149); using square mesh escape windows or larger mesh sizes, which improved size-selectivity of Atlantic cod, black sea bass and most fish species (Action 2702); and using different trap types with various escape devices that reduced unwanted catches of multiple fish species including brown trout, black sea bass, herring, bluethroat wrasse, leatherjacket, cod, protected rockfishes, whitefish, American eel, winter flounder, and sharks/rays (Action 2702). The combination of fitting escape frames with larger mesh sizes appeared particularly effective at reducing unwanted undersized catches (Action 2149).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What gear modifications are available to reduce the unwanted catch of fish in commercial prawn and shrimp trawl fisheries?\nanswer: Commercial prawn and shrimp trawl fisheries can use several gear modifications to reduce unwanted fish catch. Size-sorting escape grids (rigid or flexible) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets represent one of the most widely studied modifications, with thirty studies showing that these devices reduce unwanted fish catches by allowing the escape of non-commercial species and discarded commercial species/sizes (Action 2721). Different designs and configurations of these escape grids have been tested in twenty-three studies, with six of sixteen studies finding reduced unwanted catches of fish species (Action 2728).\n\nSize-sorting mesh funnels (sieve nets) fitted to prawn/shrimp trawl nets reduce catches of unwanted non-commercial or discarded fish compared to standard trawls (Action 2722). Combining escape grids with large, supported escape openings reduces catches of unwanted fish and sharks and rays, with three of four studies showing effectiveness (Action 2726).\n\nMesh escape panels/windows can be modified in configuration including position, size and mesh size, with three of five studies showing reduced unwanted catches of certain fish species like whiting, haddock and boarfish (Action 2717). When mesh escape panels/windows are combined with size-sorting grids, four of five studies found reduced unwanted catch of fish, sharks and stingrays compared to standard unmodified trawl nets (Action 2727).\n\nOther modifications include raising parts of bottom trawl gear off the seabed, which reduces catches of unwanted sharks, other elasmobranchs and fish species (Action 2708). Topless or coverless trawls reduce unwanted catches in two of four studies, particularly for Atlantic cod and discards of commercial fish species (Action 2712). Moving stimulator devices fitted to trawl nets can increase fish escape response, though effectiveness varies by species and requires combination with other devices in some cases (Action 2729).\n\nModified designs of W-trawl nets specifically for shrimp/prawn fisheries catch less non-commercial unwanted catch of crustaceans compared to traditional Florida Flyer trawl nets (Action 2139).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the evidence for gear modifications improving the size-selectivity of commercial fishing gear?\nanswer: Multiple controlled studies provide evidence that various gear modifications can improve the size-selectivity of commercial fishing gear. Five replicated, controlled studies in the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea found that modifications to trawl gear, including changes to the length of the extension piece, the codend strengthening bag, the method of weaving, the number of codend layers and overall design improved the size-selectivity for unwanted (non-target/discarded) fish species or sizes, and annular seabream in one of two cases, compared to unmodified standard trawl gear or other design configurations (Action 2704). Four of five replicated studies in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Adriatic Sea found that using different twine types (twine thickness and construction material) improved the size-selectivity of bottom fish, haddock, Atlantic cod, plaice and flounder, compared to thinner or other twine materials (Action 2710). Three of seven replicated studies in the Barents/Norwegian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland Sea found that different types or configurations of size-sorting escape grid systems in trawl nets resulted in better size-selectivity for unwanted redfish and Greenland halibut and of commercial target hake compared to other designs or configurations (Action 2728). Four of five replicated, controlled studies in the Baltic Sea, Aegean Sea, and North Sea found that turning the orientation of diamond mesh in trawl codends by 90\u00b0 resulted in better size selection of cod, red mullet and common pandora, and round-bodied fish species, but not of plaice, annular sea bream, and flatfish species, compared to standard orientation of diamond mesh in trawl codends (Action 2715). However, some modifications showed limited effects, as one replicated study in the North Sea found that reducing the size of the main body of a trawl net did not improve the size-selection of cod and haddock (Action 2705). Additionally, three replicated studies found that the effect of using a different design or configuration of size-sorting escape grid/system on improving the size-selectivity of trawls varied between fish species compared to standard or other escape grid designs (Action 2728).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the documented ecological outcomes of managing small-scale traditional fisheries, either through prohibition or by making them the only permitted fishing type?\nanswer: Based on the documented evidence, several ecological outcomes have been observed from different approaches to managing small-scale traditional fisheries:\n\nWhen allowing only small-scale traditional (artisanal) fishing: In the Adriatic Sea, a marine protected area zone allowing only artisanal fishing activity for three years had higher overall commercial catch rates of five of seven fish species compared to unprotected areas openly fished (Action 2678).\n\nWhen prohibiting customary/traditional fishing: In the Bismark Sea, an area closed to customary fishing for eight years showed higher abundance of only one of seven fish species compared to an area open to customary fishing. Additionally, six of seven fish species had a lower flight response distance in the closed area, making them more vulnerable to capture with spear guns (Action 2675).\n\nWhen establishing community-based fisheries management: In the Foveaux Straight, a customary fisheries area with community-based management had more New Zealand scallops compared to both a protected area prohibiting all fishing and an area allowing recreational harvest, though the scallops tended to be smaller (Action 2242).\n\nWhen prohibiting commercial fishing while allowing other activities: Results varied depending on the specific management approach. In some cases, marine protected areas prohibiting commercial fishing showed mixed results for lobster populations, with some studies finding no increase in abundance over 12 years, while others found bigger lobsters in protected areas compared to fished areas (Action 2225).\n\nGeneral fishing restrictions in marine protected areas: A global review found that 10 of 11 studies showed higher fish abundance inside areas with fishing restrictions compared to areas without restrictions, and five out of 11 studies found larger fish inside protected areas (Action 2680). When territorial user rights for fisheries were established, one study found larger-sized and more numerous egg capsules and more larvae of Chilean abalone compared to open-access areas (Action 2104).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
