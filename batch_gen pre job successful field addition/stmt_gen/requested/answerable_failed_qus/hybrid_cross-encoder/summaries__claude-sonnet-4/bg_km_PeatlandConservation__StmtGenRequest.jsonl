The moss layer transfer technique shows promising results, with studies in Canadian bogs demonstrating that restored areas developed bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years and achieved greater moss/bryophyte cover including Sphagnum compared to unrestored areas (Action 1804). Direct planting of peatland mosses is effective, with studies showing that planted Sphagnum had high survival rates (47 out of 50 planted sods survived for one year in Lithuania) and increased moss coverage in multiple locations including the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Australia (Action 1818). Adding mixed vegetation to peatland surfaces shows consistent results across 18 studies in bogs, with Sphagnum moss present after 1-6 growing seasons in plots sown with vegetation containing Sphagnum, though cover was very low unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Direct planting of trees and shrubs demonstrates good survival rates, with eight studies reporting that the majority of planted trees/shrubs survived over periods between 10 weeks and 13 years in peat swamp forests and bogs, though species-specific survival varied (Action 1820). Multiple intervention approaches combining various techniques proved effective, with five studies showing increased total moss or bryophyte cover, and restoration interventions also increased cover of herbaceous plants and overall vegetation cover (Action 1803). Introducing seeds of peatland trees/shrubs showed mixed results, with some studies reporting successful germination and increased shrub cover, while others found limited survival of seedlings (Action 1824). Additional supportive interventions include removing competing vegetation, which aided Sphagnum moss survival when sown into areas where purple moor grass had been cut (Action 1840), and irrigation, which increased Sphagnum moss shoots and promoted colonization by wetland-characteristic herbs (Action 1859).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Besides direct physical removal, what alternative methods can be used to control problematic plants on peatlands?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several alternative methods to direct physical removal can be used to control problematic plants on peatlands. Biological control involves introducing an organism to control problematic plants - one study in a fen meadow in Belgium found that introducing a parasitic plant altered the overall plant community composition, reduced cover of the dominant sedge, increased moss cover, and increased overall plant species richness (Action 1777). Chemical control using herbicides is another option - one study in fens in the USA found that applying herbicide to shrubs changed the overall plant community composition, though it could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time and prevented increases in plant species richness (Action 1776). Cutting and mowing represents a mechanical alternative - studies in fens and fen meadows found that mowing altered plant community composition, increased cover of fen-characteristic plants and moss cover, reduced cover of herbs including reeds and sedges, and increased plant species richness (Action 1759). The timing of cutting can also be varied as a control strategy - studies found that summer-mown plots had greater increases in plant species richness compared to spring- or autumn-mown plots (Action 1771). However, no studies were found that evaluated the use of covers or barriers to control problematic plants in peatlands (Action 1775).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Adding Sphagnum moss or moss fragments to peatland surfaces resulted in Sphagnum moss being present after 1-4 growing seasons in at least some plots, with cover ranging from negligible to >90% (Action 1821). Six controlled studies found that Sphagnum cover or abundance was higher in sown than unsown plots (Action 1821). Other mosses or bryophytes were present after 2-3 growing seasons in plots sown with moss fragments, with cover ranging from negligible to 76%, though cover was low (<1%) unless plots were mulched, shaded or limed (Action 1821). Spreading mixed vegetation onto peatland surfaces resulted in Sphagnum moss being present after 1-6 growing seasons with cover ranging from <1 to 73%, and six controlled studies found Sphagnum cover was higher in sown than unsown plots (Action 1822). However, five studies reported Sphagnum cover was very low (<1%) unless plots were mulched after spreading fragments (Action 1822). Other mosses or bryophytes appeared after 1-6 growing seasons with cover of <1-65% (Action 1822). Vascular plants appeared following addition of mixed vegetation fragments, with one controlled study finding vascular plant cover was significantly higher in sown than unsown plots, though another found no effect on herb cover (Action 1822). For tree/shrub fragments in freshwater wetlands, one study reported 12% overall survival of planted unrooted tree cuttings over two years (Action 3262). Introduction of nurse plants showed no effect on survival of planted peat swamp tree seedlings or on cover of other planted vegetation after 2-3 years (Action 1830).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two studies evaluated replacing blocks of vegetation after mining or peat extraction, finding that transplanted vegetation blocks retained their peatland vegetation community in both a UK bog and Canadian fen, with communities remaining similar to undisturbed reference sites (Action 1738). However, Sphagnum moss cover declined in the translocated blocks in the UK study.\n\nFour studies evaluated restoration using the moss layer transfer technique, all in Canadian bogs, showing that the majority of restored areas developed bog-characteristic plant species within 11 years, with restored areas having greater moss and bryophyte cover than unrestored areas after 4-8 years (Action 1804).

Four studies evaluated reprofiling before planting, finding higher Sphagnum survival and cover in reprofiled basins compared to raised plots after 1-4 growing seasons (Action 1833).

Disturbing the peat surface has been shown to encourage plant colonization, with two studies in fens in Germany and Sweden reporting that soil disturbance affected plant community development over 2-3 years, with wetland- or fen-characteristic plant species colonizing disturbed plots (Action 1811). Filling or blocking ditches creates suitable conditions for natural colonization, with studies showing that blocked or filled ditches were colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years, with vegetation cover being restored to natural, undisturbed levels in some cases (Action 1805). Pool excavation can also promote vegetation establishment, with studies in Canadian bogs showing that excavated pools were colonized by peatland vegetation over 4-6 years, though they contained different plant communities compared to natural pools (Action 1806). Creating mounds or hollows through roughening the peat surface (by harrowing, ploughing, creating vehicle tracks or adding peat blocks) has been tested, though studies focused on planted vegetation rather than natural colonization (Action 1834). Surface stabilization using coconut fibre rolls has been tested but did not significantly affect vegetation development in one UK bog study (Action 1815).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the most effective policy or awareness-based approaches for protecting peatland habitats?\nanswer: Based on studies evaluating policy and awareness-based approaches for peatland protection, several key strategies have shown effectiveness. Lobbying, campaigning, and demonstrating for peatland protection resulted in increased area of protected peatland in the UK, behavior change among major retailers who stopped buying compost containing peat from important peatland areas, and horticultural companies began marketing peat-free compost (Action 1849). Additionally, garden centres and local governments signed peatland conservation agreements following campaign pressure (Action 1849). Legal protection of peatlands showed mixed results, with some studies reporting that protected areas maintained greater vegetation cover than unprotected adjacent areas, though peatland area initially decreased before then increasing following legal protection (Action 1796). Payment schemes for landowners to protect peatlands demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with agri-environment schemes in the UK protecting bog habitat in three of six cases (Action 1799). On-the-ground protection measures such as anti-logging patrols resulted in decreased numbers of illegal sawmills in Indonesian peat swamp forests (Action 1800). However, some policy approaches lacked sufficient research evidence, with no studies found evaluating the effects of zero burning policies near peatlands or creating 'no net loss' wetland legislation specifically for peatlands (Actions 1856, 1797).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Zero burning policies near peatlands (Action 1856) represent another policy tool for protection.\n\n**Financial Approaches:**\nPayment schemes for landowners to protect peatlands (Action 1799) have been implemented, with agri-environment schemes in the UK showing mixed effects on bogs, protecting the area of bog habitat in three of six cases.\n\n**Awareness-Raising Approaches:**\nLobbying, campaigning, or demonstrating to protect peatlands (Action 1849) has shown effectiveness in the UK, where campaign pressure resulted in increased area of protected peatland, major retailers stopping purchase of compost containing peat from important peatland areas, horticultural companies beginning to market peat-free compost, and garden centres and local governments signing peatland conservation agreements. General public awareness-raising activities (Action 1844) have also demonstrated impact, with one UK study reporting that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased. Raising awareness through engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring (Action 1847) and raising awareness about problematic species (Action 1846) are additional awareness approaches, though no studies have yet evaluated their effectiveness. Adopting ecotourism principles or creating ecotourism sites (Action 1755) represents another potential awareness and economic approach.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the typical outcomes when introducing seeds to restore peatland vegetation?\nanswer: When introducing seeds to restore peatland vegetation, studies show mixed outcomes across different aspects of restoration success. For germination, some seeds successfully germinate but with variable success rates - studies in Germany and the USA reported germination of heather and willow seeds respectively in at least some sown plots (Action 1824), while herb seed germination varied with three of four species germinating in a German bog but only one of seven species germinating in a USA fen (Action 1823). Survival rates present challenges, with one study showing heather seedlings surviving over two years in a German bog, but all germinated willow seedlings dying within one month in a USA fen (Action 1824). Regarding vegetation establishment, outcomes depend on the type of plants and peatland. For shrub cover, some studies reported greater cover of certain shrubs like manuka or naturally colonizing heather in sown plots compared to unsown areas, though not all species showed this effect, and one study found similar overall shrub cover between sown and unsown plots within two years (Action 1824). Herb cover development showed that sown herbs established in some cases, with plots developing cover of the sown herbs, though one study found similar herb cover between sown and unsown plots (Action 1823). Total vegetation cover generally increased in sown plots according to two studies, though one long-term study after 25 years showed no effect (Action 1824). Species diversity outcomes varied considerably, with one study showing increased plant species richness, another showing fewer plant species in sown plots, and a third showing no effect on species richness (Action 1824). For herb seeding specifically, effects on species richness were inconsistent or showed no effect across multiple studies (Action 1823).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Cutting to control problematic large trees/shrubs demonstrates effectiveness, with studies showing that tree/shrub removal can lead to plant community composition becoming more like undegraded, open fen and increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants (Action 1772). One study found that species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants increased following tree/shrub removal in a fen in Sweden (Action 1772). Additionally, cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance has shown positive results, with one study in a fen in Poland finding that shrub removal (along with other interventions) resulted in plant community composition becoming more like a target fen meadow and increased abundance of fen meadow plant species (Action 1761). Physical removal of problematic plants has also shown benefits, with one study in Ireland reporting that cover of fen-characteristic plants increased after mossy vegetation was removed (Action 1768). Cutting in freshwater marshes has demonstrated increases in total vegetation coverage, plant richness, slack-characteristic plant species, and native plant richness between one and two years after clearing scrub (Action 3108). Grazing to maintain or restore disturbance shows mixed results, with some studies reporting increased cover of herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, and reduced shrub cover in some cases, though effects vary between studies (Action 1762).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: To restore open peatlands that have become overgrown with trees and shrubs, what are the most beneficial interventions?\nanswer: The most beneficial interventions for restoring open peatlands that have become overgrown with trees and shrubs involve a combination of cutting/removal techniques and water management strategies. \n\nCutting problematic large trees and shrubs (action 1772) in fens results in changed plant community composition becoming more like undegraded, open fen, with increased species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, and increased moss and vascular plant cover. Similarly, cutting large trees/shrubs to maintain or restore disturbance (action 1761) makes plant community composition more like target fen meadows and increases abundance of fen meadow plant species, while also increasing herb cover and biomass.\n\nForest plantation removal (action 1731) increases cover of herb species including cottongrasses and sedges, though it can reduce forest-characteristic moss cover initially. The intervention also increases total plant species richness, with effects being much smaller in rewetted plots than in drained plots.\n\nThe most effective approach combines tree/shrub removal with rewetting (action 1732). This combination intervention increases abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, increases Sphagnum moss cover in some cases, reduces cover of non-Sphagnum or forest-characteristic mosses, and increases cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges. It also increases plant species richness in rich fens and can reduce the number of tall trees present.\n\nRewetting peatlands alone (action 1756) creates conditions where drier grassland communities are replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities, increases Sphagnum moss cover, increases cover of sedges, cottongrasses, and reed/rush species, and typically reduces or has no effect on tree and shrub cover. This intervention increases total plant species richness or diversity in many cases.\n\nFor controlling remaining problematic herbaceous vegetation after tree removal, cutting/mowing (action 1770) can increase presence of fen-characteristic plant species, increase Sphagnum moss cover, and reduce purple moor grass cover.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the state of the evidence for actions to mitigate pollution from agricultural sources near peatlands?\nanswer: The evidence for actions to mitigate pollution from agricultural sources near peatlands is extremely limited. For most agricultural pollution mitigation actions specifically targeting peatlands, no studies have been found that directly evaluate their effectiveness. Actions with no evidence include: using artificial barriers to prevent pollution entering peatlands (Action 1782), reducing fertilizer or herbicide use near peatlands (Action 1783), converting to organic agriculture or aquaculture near peatlands (Action 1785), retaining or creating buffer zones between pollution sources and peatlands (Action 1781), managing fertilizer or herbicide application near peatlands (Action 1784), limiting the density of livestock on farmland near peatlands (Action 1786), and using biodegradable oil in farming machinery (Action 1787). Some evidence exists for general pollution mitigation approaches, though not specifically from agricultural sources. One study in a floating fen in the Netherlands found that cleaning waste water before it enters the environment (along with other interventions) increased cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels and decreased vascular plant biomass (Action 1778). Three studies found that diverting or replacing polluted water sources increased Sphagnum moss cover in bogs and mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels in fens, with mixed effects on herb cover (Action 1779). One study showed that slowing down input water to allow more time for pollutants to be removed (along with other interventions) increased cover of mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels and decreased vascular plant biomass in a fen (Action 1780).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Reprofiling/relandscaping peatland before planting (action 1833) shows beneficial effects, with one study finding higher survival of sown Sphagnum mosses in reprofiled basins compared to raised plots after one growing season, and two studies reporting higher Sphagnum cover in reprofiled basins than raised plots 3-4 growing seasons after sowing. However, one study found total Sphagnum cover did not differ between reprofiled and raised plots 1-2 years after sowing. Creating mounds or hollows before planting (action 1834) has mixed results, with one study finding trees planted into peat mounds grew thicker stems than those planted at ground level, but two studies found that roughening the peat surface did not significantly affect cover of planted Sphagnum moss after 1-3 growing seasons. Adding fresh peat before planting (action 1837) showed positive effects in one study, with plots amended with fine peat supporting higher cover of two sown plant species than the original tilled bog surface, though fertilization cancelled out this effect for one species. Stabilizing peatland surface to help plants colonize (action 1815) was found ineffective in one study, where pegging coconut fibre rolls onto almost-bare peat did not affect development of vegetation cover. Disturbing peatland surface (action 1811) affected plant community development, with disturbed plots developing greater cover of weedy species and allowing colonization of wetland-characteristic species, though peat-forming species did not colonize. Some actions lack research evidence: removing upper layer of peat/soil before planting (action 1835) and roughening peat surface to create microclimates (action 1808) have no studies evaluating their effects.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

This study was conducted in a fen meadow in Poland and focused on boar and deer exclusion (Action ID: 1860). The study reported that the effect of boar and deer exclusion on vascular plant cover, moss cover, total vegetation biomass, and plant species richness depended on other treatments applied to plots. However, no studies were found that specifically evaluated the effects of using barriers to keep livestock off ungrazed peatlands (Action ID: 1733) or using fences or barriers to protect planted peatland vegetation (Action ID: 1839). The limited evidence suggests that physical barriers can be used to exclude wild herbivores from peatlands, but the effectiveness appears to vary depending on other management treatments implemented alongside the barriers.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: As an alternative to prescribed burning for managing vegetation on fens, what are the effects of mowing or introducing grazing?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, both mowing and grazing are alternatives to prescribed burning for fen vegetation management, with distinct effects:\n\n**Effects of Mowing in Fens:**\nMowing alters overall plant community composition compared to no mowing or grazing (Action 1759). Studies found that mowing increased cover of fen- or wet meadow-characteristic plants and increased total moss or bryophyte cover (Action 1759). Mowing reduced cover or abundance of at least one group of herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall (Action 1759). Eight studies found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing (Action 1759). Fens managed by mowing had greater species richness of butterflies than fens managed by cattle grazing (Action 3950).\n\n**Effects of Grazing in Fens:**\nGrazing creates different plant community composition compared to mown fen meadows (Action 1762). Studies reported that grazing increased cover of some herb groups including cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants, and in one study reduced purple moor grass cover (Action 1762). Grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer total plant species than mown meadows (Action 1762). One study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated while another reported typically no effect (Action 1762).\n\n**Comparative Effects:**\nA study found that the abundance of bog/fen-characteristic plants was similar in grazed and ungrazed fen meadows (Action 1762). Grazed fen meadows had similar vegetation structure to mown meadows (Action 1759). However, recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival than uncut fens (Action 3950).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the effects of different interventions designed to manipulate water levels on drained peatlands without planting?\nanswer: Based on the action documents, several water level manipulation interventions have been studied on drained peatlands without planting. Rewetting peatlands by raising the water table (action ID 1756) was evaluated in 36 studies across bogs, fens, and other peatlands. This intervention typically caused drier grassland communities to be replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities, with rewetted plots developing different plant communities compared to drained plots. Rewetting increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in 12 studies across multiple countries, though three studies reported mixed responses by species and two studies found no effect. The intervention increased cover of various herb groups, with particularly strong effects on sedges (increased in 13 of 15 studies), cottongrass (increased in 8 of 9 studies), and reeds/rushes (increased in 5 of 7 studies), while purple moor grass cover was typically reduced. Tree and shrub cover was generally reduced or unaffected by rewetting. Effects on overall plant species richness were mixed, with six studies reporting increases, five finding no effect, and one study reporting reduced diversity.\n\nIrrigation of peatlands without planting (action ID 1859) was studied in only two investigations. In a Canadian bog, irrigation increased Sphagnum moss shoots after one growing season but had no effect after two seasons. In a German fen, irrigation led to colonization by wetland- and fen-characteristic herbs while cover of dryland grasses decreased.\n\nDraining or replacing acidic water (action ID 1791) was evaluated in two fen studies in the Netherlands, showing mixed effects on Sphagnum moss and herb cover after 4-5 years depending on species and whether moss was also removed, though one study reported increased plant species richness.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
