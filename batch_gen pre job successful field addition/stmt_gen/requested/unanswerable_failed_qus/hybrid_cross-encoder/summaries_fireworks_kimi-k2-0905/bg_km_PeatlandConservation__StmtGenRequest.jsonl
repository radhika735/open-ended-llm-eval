Among the methods with available data:\n\nCutting/mowing herbaceous plants shows some effectiveness, with one replicated study in Sweden finding that mown plots contained more fen-characteristic plant species than unmown plots (Action 1770). Another study found cutting large trees/shrubs can increase species richness and cover of fen-characteristic plants, along with increasing moss and vascular plant cover and richness (Action 1772).\n\nPhysical removal of problematic plants showed mixed results in three replicated studies in fens, with one Irish study reporting increased cover of fen-characteristic plants after mossy vegetation was removed, though effects varied by species, site, and drainage conditions (Action 1768).\n\nHerbicide application to shrubs was evaluated in one replicated, controlled study in fens, which found that while it changed plant community composition, it could not prevent increases in shrub cover over time (Action 1776).\n\nHowever, the database lacks specific cost-effectiveness comparisons between these methods or economic analyses for peatland plant control specifically. No studies were found that directly compared the costs and effectiveness of different control methods on peatlands.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
