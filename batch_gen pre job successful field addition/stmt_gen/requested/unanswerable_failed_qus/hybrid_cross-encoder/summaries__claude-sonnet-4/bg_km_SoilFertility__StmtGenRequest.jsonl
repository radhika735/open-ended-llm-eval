Action 890 shows that adding municipal compost to semi-arid soils greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff, though this study found mixed results for other waste composts. Action 1362 provides evidence from multiple studies showing that adding compost to soil increases organic matter levels compared to soils without added compost, with twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with added compost. The same action shows that six studies found more nutrients in soils with added compost, while six studies found more microbial biomass in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost. Additionally, four studies found that soils with added compost were more stable than soils without added compost. However, the documents also note that six studies found more greenhouse gas emissions in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost. Action 889 found that applying a high rate of compost increased soil organic matter levels and microbial biomass. While these studies demonstrate positive effects of compost on soil fertility indicators, none of the available documents specifically address the 20-year timeframe requested in the query.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
