The action document on \"Introduce beavers to impede water flow in forest watercourses\" (Action 1187) specifically states that no evidence was found for the effects of introducing beavers in forest environments. The action document on \"Reintroduce overharvested animals\" (Action 3018) indicates that no studies were found that evaluated the effects on marsh/swamp vegetation of reintroducing overharvested animals. No action documents were identified that specifically address beaver reintroduction in Patagonian peatlands or their vegetation impacts in this ecosystem.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The available research includes studies with shorter time periods and provides the following findings:\n\nSix studies evaluated the effects on peatland vegetation of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants, with five conducted in bogs and one in fens (Action 1774). One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany found that burning increased moss/lichen/bare ground cover in the short term (2-7 months after burning). Three replicated, paired studies based on the same experimental set-up in one bog in the UK found that moss cover (including Sphagnum) was higher in plots burned more often (Action 1774).\n\nRegarding herb cover, one replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in the UK found that burning increased cottongrass cover after 8-18 years. Two replicated, paired studies in the same bog in the UK reported that cottongrass cover was similar in plots burned every 10 or 20 years. The study in Germany found that burning reduced purple moor grass cover but had mixed effects among sites on cover of other grass-like plants and forbs (Action 1774).\n\nFor tree/shrub cover, three replicated, paired studies in a bog in the UK found that heather cover was lower in plots burned more often. One replicated, paired, controlled study in bogs in Germany found that heather cover was lower in burned than unburned plots (Action 1774).\n\nRegarding vegetation structure, one replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the UK found that plots burned more frequently contained more biomass of grass-like plants than plots burned less often, but contained less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass (Action 1774).\n\nTwo replicated, controlled studies in fens in the USA and a bog in the UK found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (Action 1774).\n\nHowever, none of the identified studies specifically examined effects over a 30-year period or longer on bog vegetation composition.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
