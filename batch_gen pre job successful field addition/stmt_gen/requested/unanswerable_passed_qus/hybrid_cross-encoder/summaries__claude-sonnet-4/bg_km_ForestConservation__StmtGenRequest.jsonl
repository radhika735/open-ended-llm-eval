For prescribed fire specifically targeting invasive species removal, no evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1196). However, for mechanical/manual removal of invasive plants, one study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity (Action 1228). A study in Ghana found that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height, but a Hawaiian study found no effect of invasive plant removal on growth rate of native species (Action 1228). General prescribed fire studies show mixed results on understory vegetation: eight of 22 studies found prescribed fire increased cover, density and biomass of understory plants, while six found it decreased plant cover, and eight found no effect or mixed effects (Action 1221). For invasive plant control broadly, studies show mixed effectiveness depending on the specific method and target species (Action 3697, Action 823).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
