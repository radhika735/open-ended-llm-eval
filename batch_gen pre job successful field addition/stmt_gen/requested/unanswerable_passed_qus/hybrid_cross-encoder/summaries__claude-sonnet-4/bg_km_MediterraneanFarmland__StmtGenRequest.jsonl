The available evidence focuses primarily on European agri-environment schemes and conservation payment programs in general, with studies from countries including the UK, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, USA, Germany, Spain, and Estonia, but no specific mention of Greek policies or programs is found in the action documents reviewed. The documents describe general agri-environment schemes where farmers are paid to cover the costs of conservation measures (Action IDs: 962, 818, 700, 3915), and mention riparian habitat restoration along watercourses (Action IDs: 1402, 1388), but do not provide details about specific policy frameworks or incentive structures available in Greece for this purpose.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
