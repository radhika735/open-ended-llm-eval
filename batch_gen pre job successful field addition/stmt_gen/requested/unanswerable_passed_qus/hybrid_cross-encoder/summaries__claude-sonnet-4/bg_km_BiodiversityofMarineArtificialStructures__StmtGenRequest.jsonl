However, related research on hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures showed mixed effects on fish abundance. Two studies found that creating hole habitats on subtidal artificial structures did not increase fish species abundances on and around structures, while one study reported mixed effects on fish abundances depending on the species group (Action 3434). Additionally, studies on groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) on subtidal artificial structures found mixed effects on fish abundances depending on the species group (Action 3448).

Action 3443 states \"We found no studies that evaluated the effects of creating large protrusions on subtidal artificial structures on the biodiversity of those structures.\" Similarly, other eco-engineering interventions on subtidal artificial structures such as creating crevice habitats (Action 3454), creating large ridges or ledges (Action 3445), and reducing the slope of structures (Action 3442) also have no available studies evaluating their effects on biodiversity. The action documents that do address eco-engineering on artificial structures focus primarily on effects on macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish communities, with Action 3470 describing studies on environmentally-sensitive materials that examined community composition and abundance of these groups, but no specific mention of marine mammal interactions or effects.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Two studies from southeast Australia examined the biological effects of reducing slopes on intertidal artificial structures, finding that one study reported increased combined macroalgae, invertebrate and fish species richness when slope reduction was combined with creating rock pools, while another study found no increase in macroalgal abundance or oyster and mobile invertebrate abundance from slope reduction alone (Action 3461).

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for increasing biodiversity on subtidal artificial structures?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence from action documents, using environmentally-sensitive material on subtidal artificial structures shows the most promise for increasing biodiversity. Fourteen studies examined this approach (action 3470). Six of 11 studies found that using shell-concrete or quarried rock in place of standard-concrete on subtidal artificial structures, or using ECOncrete\u2122 in place of standard-concrete or fibreglass, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, altered the combined macroalgae and invertebrate community composition on structure surfaces. Three studies found that ECOncrete\u2122 surfaces with added habitats supported mobile invertebrate, non-mobile invertebrate and/or fish species that were absent from standard-concrete or fibreglass structure surfaces. Three studies found that using ECOncrete\u2122, along with creating texture, grooves, holes, pits and/or small ledges, did increase the species diversity and/or richness on and around structures. Additionally, managing or restricting harvesting showed some benefits with one study finding higher fish species richness around a subtidal artificial structure with harvesting restrictions compared with unrestricted structures (action 3457). Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) had mixed effects on invertebrate communities depending on density, length and site (action 3450). Several other potential methods showed no evidence or mixed results, including reducing slopes (action 3442), creating large protrusions (action 3443), and creating natural rocky reef topography (action 3446).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

However, studies of similar habitat features provide related insights. For small adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (\u2264100 mm), studies in South Africa, the UK and Netherlands found that these features did not alter mobile invertebrate community composition or increase mobile invertebrate species richness or diversity on structure surfaces, but did increase mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces (Action 3468). For hole habitats (>50 mm), studies in Australia, the UK, Israel and the Netherlands found that holes, when combined with other features like grooves and small ridges, altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, supported species absent from surfaces without habitat features, and increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species diversity and richness on structure surfaces, though effects on individual invertebrate abundance were mixed (Action 3467). For groove habitats (1-50 mm), studies across multiple locations found mixed results: some studies showed that grooves supported macroalgae, mobile and non-mobile invertebrate species absent from surfaces without grooves, and in some cases increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness and diversity, though effects varied by site and groove configuration (Action 3473).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Action 3476 describes the creation of rock pools on intertidal artificial structures and notes that eighteen studies examined the effects of creating rock pools, but these studies focused primarily on biodiversity outcomes rather than structural integrity impacts. The document indicates that rock pools created on intertidal artificial structures supported various species including macroalgae, mobile invertebrates, non-mobile invertebrates, and fish species that were absent from structure surfaces without pools. One study mentioned that wave-sheltered pools filled with sediment within two years (Action 3476). Action 3469 discusses the use of environmentally-sensitive materials on intertidal artificial structures, including various concrete compositions and alternative materials like sandstone and limestone, but does not specifically address structural integrity concerns related to habitat modifications. The documents do not contain specific information about how the creation of rock pools affects material durability, erosion rates, structural stability, or other engineering performance parameters of seawalls over time.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: On subtidal structures, is creating textured surfaces more effective for increasing overall invertebrate abundance than transplanting organisms?\nanswer: Based on the evidence from subtidal artificial structures, both creating textured surfaces and transplanting organisms show mixed results for increasing invertebrate abundance. For creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm), one replicated, randomized, controlled study in Italy found that this intervention had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance on structure surfaces, depending on the site (Action 3449). Two of three replicated, controlled studies found that creating textured surfaces did not increase the combined macroalgae and non-mobile invertebrate live cover on structure surfaces, though one study found that textured surfaces combined with environmentally-sensitive material did increase cover and biomass (Action 3449). For transplanting organisms, two studies examined invertebrate abundance specifically: one replicated, randomized, controlled and site comparison study in Australia found that transplanting sea urchins onto a subtidal artificial structure reduced the cover of non-native sea mat on kelps, and one study in Singapore reported that transplanting corals increased coral cover on structure surfaces (Action 3471). One study found that transplanting oysters did not increase the combined invertebrate and fish abundance on and around structure surfaces, but effects varied for different species (Action 3471). Neither approach shows consistently superior effectiveness for increasing overall invertebrate abundance, with results varying by site, species, and study conditions.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
