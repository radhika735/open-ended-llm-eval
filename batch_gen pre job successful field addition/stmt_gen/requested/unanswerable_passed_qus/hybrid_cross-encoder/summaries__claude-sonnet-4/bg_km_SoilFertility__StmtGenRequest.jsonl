The action database contains general information about fertilizer effects on soil microbial biomass, such as findings that organic fertilizers increase microbial biomass compared to inorganic fertilizers (Action 1366), and that mixed organic and inorganic amendments result in higher microbial biomass and activity compared to inorganic fertilizers alone (Action 902). However, these studies do not address drone-based application methods or precision agriculture technologies. One action mentions drone use in agriculture but only for crop protection from mammals rather than fertilizer application (Action 2481).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The action documents focus primarily on the effectiveness and benefits of crop rotation practices rather than adoption barriers. Action 719 demonstrates that crop rotation in potato farming systems has been studied in Canada and the USA, showing effectiveness in reducing pest populations and crop diseases, increasing crop yield in some years, and increasing profit. Action 857 shows that crop rotation studies from Canada found benefits including increased soil biodiversity, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon and matter. Action 113 indicates that training for land managers, farmers and farm advisers can improve implementation quality, suggesting that lack of training or knowledge may be a barrier, though this was not specifically studied in relation to crop rotation or in Canada. However, none of the action documents specifically identify or analyze social barriers that prevent Canadian farmers from adopting crop rotation practices.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
