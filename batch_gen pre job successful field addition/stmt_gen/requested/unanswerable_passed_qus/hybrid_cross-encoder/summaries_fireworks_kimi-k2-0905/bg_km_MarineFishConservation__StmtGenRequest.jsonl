However, related research on dredging restrictions shows mixed results: one study found that ceasing shellfish dredging in the North Sea for 10 years had no effect on species richness or abundance of bottom-dwelling fish, while another study in the Firth of Lorn found that prohibiting dredging in a marine protected area for approximately 2.5 years resulted in different combined invertebrate and fish community composition compared to unprotected dredged sites.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For minimum landing sizes, evidence is limited and mixed: one global review found only one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after implementing minimum sizes and catch limits (Action ID: 2735). A replicated study in the Ionian Sea found that despite minimum size regulations, most commercially caught fish remained immature and had never spawned (Action ID: 2735). Three other studies on minimum landing sizes focused on unwanted catch reduction rather than reproductive success, showing inconsistent results (Action ID: 2735). No comparative research exists specifically examining how these different size limit approaches affect reproductive outcomes.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
