A before-and-after study in the North Atlantic Ocean found that setting vessel speed limits during specific periods in key habitats resulted in fewer North Atlantic right whale deaths caused by collisions. Another before-and-after study in the Indian River estuarine system found fewer manatee deaths after speed limits were set and enforced in all areas. While other methods like diverting shipping routes, modifying vessels, using observers, or remote detection tools have been proposed, no studies have evaluated their effectiveness for whale strike reduction.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The search revealed limited research on public education campaigns targeting plastic pollution affecting marine and freshwater mammals. One study in the Sundarbans mangroves (Bangladesh) found that an educational exhibition improved participants' willingness to change behavior to support marine conservation, but this was not specific to plastic pollution or river dolphins. Several studies examined marine mammal education campaigns more broadly, with three before-and-after studies finding that educational whale-watching tours and exhibitions improved participants' willingness to support marine conservation, donate money, or cut fishing nets to save dolphins, but again these did not specifically address plastic litter ingestion by river dolphins in South America.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
