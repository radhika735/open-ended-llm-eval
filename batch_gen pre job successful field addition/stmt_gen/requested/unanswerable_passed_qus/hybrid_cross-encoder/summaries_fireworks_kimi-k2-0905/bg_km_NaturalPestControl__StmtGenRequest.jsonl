This laboratory study examined maize genetically modified to express the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin against European corn borer. The controlled study found that pollen from this genetically modified maize did not reduce the survival or growth of eastern tiger swallowtail or spicebush swallowtail caterpillars more than pollen from non-genetically modified maize. No studies were found evaluating the community response to this pest control method.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

The study found that mass-emergence devices increased parasitism at one site but had no effect at another site. However, these devices showed no effect on pest damage to horse chestnut trees. The research was conducted in urban areas rather than traditional farm settings.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
