[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for establishing native forbs in a degraded grassland?\nanswer: Based on the evidence, sowing native grass and forbs together (action 3432) is the most consistently effective method for establishing native forbs in degraded grasslands. This approach increased forb species richness in 71% of cases and increased forb cover in multiple studies across different regions. For improved results, sowing seeds at a higher density (action 3405) can enhance forb species richness and cover compared to standard seeding rates. While adding topsoil before seeding (action 3420) increased plant species richness and sown species biomass, this method may be more costly than direct seeding approaches. Planting grassland plants as seedlings (action 3399) showed high success rates for forbs (83% of cases) but requires more labor and materials than seeding methods. Use of erosion blankets (action 3431) and irrigation (action 3430) showed mixed results and add additional costs. Direct seeding of native forbs, potentially at higher densities, emerges as the most cost-effective approach based on its consistent positive effects on forb establishment across multiple studies without requiring expensive additional treatments.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Multiple studies show that fertilizer application increases total vegetation cover in various contexts. One replicated study in the USA found that fertilizer initially increased vegetation cover when inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before sowing seeds, but after three years, vegetation cover did not differ between inoculated and non-inoculated areas. In peatlands, fertilizing typically increased total vegetation cover and plant species richness. A study in Iceland found that adding fertilizer alongside sowing seeds increased vegetation cover in two of three cases and increased shrub/tree cover in a majority of cases. In contrast, mycorrhizal inoculation showed mixed results, with one study finding no difference in vegetation cover after three years, and another showing no change in overall herbaceous species cover.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
