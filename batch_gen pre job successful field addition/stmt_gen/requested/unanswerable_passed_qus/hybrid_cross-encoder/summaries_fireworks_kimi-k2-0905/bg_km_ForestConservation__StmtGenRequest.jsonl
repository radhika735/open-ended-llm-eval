A before-and-after study in the USA (action ID 2431) found that wolf reintroduction led to adult elk numbers approximately halving, and elk calf:cow ratios also approximately halving. This reduction in elk populations could potentially benefit tree regeneration by decreasing browsing pressure on young trees and saplings. While studies on excluding vertebrate herbivores (action ID 3891) show positive ecosystem effects, the direct link between predator reintroduction and improved tree regeneration is not explicitly documented in the available evidence.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

For prescribed fire specifically, no evidence was found testing its effectiveness for removing invasive plant species in forests. However, studies show that prescribed fire has mixed effects on understory plants in general, with 8 of 22 studies showing increased plant cover/density, 6 showing decreased cover, and 8 finding no effect or mixed effects. For mechanical removal, one replicated controlled study in Hawaii found that removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass, while another study in the USA found no effect of invasive shrub removal on understory plant diversity. One study in Ghana showed that removal of invasive weed species increased tree seedling height. Without direct comparative studies, the relative effectiveness of these two approaches for invasive species control cannot be determined from the current evidence base.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
