The systematic searches have not found any studies assessing the success rate of such reintroductions. While there is evidence about breeding bats in captivity showing that reproductive success varies (6-100% of female bats successfully conceive and give birth in captivity), and survival rates of captive-born pups range from 20-100%, these studies do not address the specific challenge of reintroducing them into white-nose syndrome affected areas. The rehabilitation studies show that hand-reared orphaned bats have survival rates of 70-90% for at least 4-14 days after release into the wild, with some evidence of longer-term survival (up to nearly four years), but this is for rehabilitated bats rather than captive-bred individuals.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

According to the action documents, no studies have been found that evaluated the effects of either action on bat populations. The evidence base for both actions is currently insufficient to determine whether one approach would be more effective than the other.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
