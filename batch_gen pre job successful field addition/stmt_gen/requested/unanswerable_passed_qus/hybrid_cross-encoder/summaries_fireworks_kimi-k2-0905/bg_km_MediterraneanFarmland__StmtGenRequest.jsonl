Cover crops (action 1345) have been shown to increase soil organic matter, nitrogen, and microbial biomass in multiple studies from Mediterranean-type climates including Italy and Spain. Compost addition (action 1346) also demonstrates benefits for crop yields in some studies from Italy and Spain. However, none of the action documents provide specific cost-benefit analyses or economic comparisons between these two methods. The mixed amendment approach using both organic and inorganic amendments shows promise but does not directly address the cost-effectiveness question. Without economic data on implementation costs, the documents cannot definitively determine which method is most cost-effective for Mediterranean arable fields.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What are the primary policy incentives available to Greek farmers for restoring habitats along watercourses?\nanswer: Based on the available evidence, the primary policy incentives for farmers (including Greek farmers) to restore habitats along watercourses are agri-environment schemes that provide payments to cover the costs of conservation measures. These schemes compensate farmers for implementing habitat restoration along watercourses, which can include activities such as creating buffer strips, restoring riparian vegetation, and managing watercourse margins for wildlife conservation. The evidence shows that these payment schemes have been implemented across Europe, with studies from Denmark, Sweden, Taiwan, the Netherlands, the UK, Switzerland, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Germany demonstrating their use for various conservation purposes including habitat restoration along watercourses. While specific details about Greek implementation are limited in the available evidence, these agri-environment payment schemes represent the primary mechanism through which farmers receive policy incentives for watercourse habitat restoration activities.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
