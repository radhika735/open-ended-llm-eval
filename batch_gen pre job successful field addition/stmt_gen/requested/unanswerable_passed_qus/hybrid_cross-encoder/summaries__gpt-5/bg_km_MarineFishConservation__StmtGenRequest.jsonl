For minimum landing sizes, two studies addressing reproductive success found mixed outcomes: a global review reported that one of five swordfish fisheries showed increased recruitment after recommended minimum landing sizes and catch limits were implemented, while a replicated study in the Ionian Sea found that, despite established minimum sizes, most fish landed were immature and had never spawned [2735]. For maximum landing sizes, no studies were found evaluating effects on marine fish populations, so there is no evidence on reproductive outcomes for this intervention [2736].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One study reported reduced overall fishing effort following a long-term closure, without reporting community-level social or economic outcomes [2655].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
