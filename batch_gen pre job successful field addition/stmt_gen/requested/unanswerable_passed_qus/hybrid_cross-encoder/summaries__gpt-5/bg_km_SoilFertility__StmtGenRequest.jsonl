For example, studies from Canada and the USA report effects on pests, diseases, yields, profits, and insecticide use in potato systems, without discussing social barriers (719). Broader crop-rotation summaries that include Canadian studies report biodiversity, erosion/runoff, soil organic carbon, and soil organic matter outcomes, but do not mention social or adoption barriers (857). Additional rotation-focused documents summarize yield, crop quality, water-use, and microbial outcomes, with no discussion of social barriers to adoption (1354; 1383; 2305).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
