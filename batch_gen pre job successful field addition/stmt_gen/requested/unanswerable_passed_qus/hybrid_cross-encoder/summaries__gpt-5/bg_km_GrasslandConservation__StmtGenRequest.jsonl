In peatlands planted with peatland species, fertilizer increased total vegetation, vascular plant and bryophyte cover in one Canadian bog; in another Canadian bog restored as a fen it increased sedge cover but did not affect total vegetation cover, total herb cover or Sphagnum cover; a New Zealand bog reported increased cover of a sown shrub and a rush depending on fertilizer chemical and peat preparation [1826]. Adding inorganic fertilizer without planting increased total vegetation cover in a New Zealand bog [1812].\n- Inoculating soil with mycorrhiza around seeding/planting: Before sowing, one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study found vegetation cover initially increased but after three years did not differ from uninoculated areas; another controlled study found adding soil microbes and nutrients when planting grass plugs did not change overall herbaceous cover [3429]. There is no evidence assessing the effects of infecting tree seedlings with mycorrhizae [1160].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
