Evidence on rotenone-based fish removal reports effects on amphibians (increases in species numbers, abundance or recruitment in several cases, and some mortality in others), but these sources do not report outcomes for native invertebrate communities, and no long-term invertebrate community impacts are described (828).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Evidence on direct removal of adult bullfrogs indicates low catchability with one double fyke net over 24 hours in small shallow ponds in Belgium, rapid population rebound after intensive adult removal in the USA, successful overnight capture using a single floating trap in one small USA study, and a significant reduction in recorded adults and juveniles when metamorphosed individuals were shot before reproduction as part of a combination treatment in France [1045]. No cost data were reported in these studies.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
