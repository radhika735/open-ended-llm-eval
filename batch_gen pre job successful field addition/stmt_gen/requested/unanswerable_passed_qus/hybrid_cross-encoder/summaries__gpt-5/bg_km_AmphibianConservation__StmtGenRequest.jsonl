A review reported that legislation reducing trade in two frog species allowed recovery of populations that had been over-exploited [824][785]. For reptiles, one study in the Cayman Islands found that where a commercial turtle farm operated, consumption and purchase of wild turtle products was rare, though some residents still preferred wild meat [3539]. The evidence base also notes no studies evaluating the effects of using amphibians sustainably [793].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for creating new ponds for great crested newts?\nanswer: Evidence on creating ponds for great crested newts reports that naturally colonizing, captive-bred and translocated great crested newts established breeding populations at 57\u201375% of created ponds or sites, and that up to 88% of created ponds were colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing great crested newts; head-started great crested newts reproduced in 38% of created ponds [863]. A systematic review in the UK found no conclusive evidence that mitigation, which often included pond creation, resulted in self-sustaining populations [863]. For salamanders including newts, studies found that stable breeding populations were established in 20\u2013100% of created ponds, with reproduction reported in 60\u2013100% of created ponds across several species [867]. For translocations of great crested newts, four of six studies found that breeding populations were maintained or established, with reproduction following 56% of translocations in one review, but breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years in one study; a systematic review found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including translocations resulted in self-sustaining populations [858].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
