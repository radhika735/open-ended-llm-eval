Beetle banks could produce economic savings if they prevent pests from reaching spray thresholds or causing around 5% yield loss, based on a replicated, randomized, controlled trial and a review [729]. Alley cropping had lower costs but also lower profit in one USA study [718].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
