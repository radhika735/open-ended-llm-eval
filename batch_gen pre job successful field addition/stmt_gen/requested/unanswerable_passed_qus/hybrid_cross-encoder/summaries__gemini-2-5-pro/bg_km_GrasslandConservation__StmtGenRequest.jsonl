However, several methods have been studied for their effectiveness in establishing vegetation.\n\nSowing native grass and forb seeds has been shown to increase the richness of forb species in 71% of cases in one UK study (3432). Three out of four studies in the Czech Republic and the USA found that this method increased the cover or density of forb species (3432). Another study in the USA found that sowing seeds at a higher density also increased forb species richness and cover (3405). Additionally, using an organic blanket after sowing seeds was found to increase overall plant species richness in a study in Spain (3431).\n\nWhile these methods have been shown to be effective in establishing forbs and other vegetation, the provided documents do not contain any information regarding the costs associated with these methods.\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

Output the statements in the following format strictly. [Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: How does sowing native grass and forb seeds impact local pollinator populations?\nanswer: Sowing native grass and forb seeds has been shown to increase overall plant species richness, as well as the richness of forbs and sown species (3432). In terms of abundance, sowing these seeds was found to increase the abundance of sown species in most cases (3432). One study found that sowing native grass and forb seeds increased the cover and density of forb species (3432).\n\nActions that enhance floral resources have a positive impact on pollinators. One study found that planting flower strips resulted in more wild bee species and individuals (1406). Another study showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was positively correlated with the number of \u2018pollen and nectar\u2019 agri-environment agreements in the area (362). Additionally, some planted flower species have been found to be more attractive to pollinators than others (1406).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One replicated, controlled study in the UK found that applying herbicide before sowing seeds increased sown species richness [3418]. One of two replicated, controlled studies in the UK and Belgium found that removing vegetation before sowing seeds increased the germination rate of sown species, and the other study found that removing vegetation, along with removing leaf litter, before sowing seeds increased the number of seedlings for one of three species [3416].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: Is adding fertilizer more effective for increasing overall vegetation cover than inoculating soil with mycorrhiza after seeding?\nanswer: One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA found that inoculating soil with mycorrhizal fungi before sowing seeds initially increased vegetation cover, but after three years, there was no difference in vegetation cover between inoculated and uninoculated areas [3429]. Another controlled study in the USA found that adding soil microbes and nutrients when planting grass plugs did not change the overall cover of herbaceous species [3429].\n\nA replicated, controlled study in Iceland that involved adding fertilizer and sowing seeds found an increase in vegetation cover in two of three cases [1704]. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a bog in New Zealand reported that fertilizing typically increased total vegetation cover [1812]. Another replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in a bog in Canada found that fertilizer increased total vegetation, vascular plant and bryophyte cover [1826]. However, a separate study in a bog in Canada found that fertilizer increased sedge cover but had no effect on total vegetation cover [1826]. Another study in a bog in New Zealand reported that fertilizer typically increased the cover of a sown shrub and rush, but this was dependent on the chemical in the fertilizer and preparation of the peat [1826].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
