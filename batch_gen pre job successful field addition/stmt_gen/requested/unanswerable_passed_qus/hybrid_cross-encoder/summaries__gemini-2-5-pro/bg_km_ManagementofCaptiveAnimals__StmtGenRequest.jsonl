One before-and-after study in Italy found that in the presence of their groupmates monkeys ate more unfamiliar foods during the first encounter [1343]. One replicated, before-and-after study in the Netherlands and Germany found that when presented with stinging nettles captive gorillas used the same processing skills as wild gorillas to forage [1332]. No evidence was captured for the effects of providing nectar (including artificial nectar) to primates [1331].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
