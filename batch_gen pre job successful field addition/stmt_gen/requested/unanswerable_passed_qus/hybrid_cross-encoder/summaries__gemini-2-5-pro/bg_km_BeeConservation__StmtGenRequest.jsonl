[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for creating bee-friendly habitats on farmland?\nanswer: Based on the available information, several methods can support bee-friendly habitats on farmland. Planting dedicated floral resources has been shown to be effective, with fourteen trials in Europe and North America recording substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on both perennial and annual sown flowering plants (17). Specifically, ten trials found that patches of phacelia attracted a high number of wild bees, particularly bumblebees (17). One trial also demonstrated that planted perennial leguminous herbs, such as clovers, were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with more arable farming (17).\n\nAnother effective measure is providing artificial nest sites. In 29 out of 30 replicated trials, nest boxes for solitary bees showed occupancy (47). These nest sites, including cut hollow stems, tubes, and drilled wood blocks, are used by many species of solitary bees (47). One trial found that the number of occupied solitary bee nests could double over three years with repeated provision of nest boxes (47).\n\nOther strategies have shown mixed or specific results. Providing set-aside areas that are annually mown and left to naturally regenerate for two or more years can lead to higher species richness of nesting and foraging bees (7). Reducing the intensity of farmland meadow management, such as delaying the first cut and using fewer agrochemicals, resulted in enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees in two of four trials (22). Agri-environment schemes have also shown varied outcomes; four trials in Europe found enhanced bee diversity or abundance, while another four trials found no enhancement (24).\n\nNo evidence was found to support the effectiveness of introducing nest boxes already stocked with solitary bees (81) or increasing the use of clover leys on farmland (16).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for increasing wild bee populations on farmland?\nanswer: Fourteen trials in Europe and North America found significant numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants, both perennial and annual, in agricultural settings [17]. Ten trials have monitored bees foraging on patches sown with a high proportion of phacelia on farmland, and all but one found substantial numbers of foraging wild (non-Apis) bees, particularly bumblebees [17]. One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed that planted perennial leguminous herbs, including clovers, were more attractive to bumblebees in landscapes with a greater proportion of arable farming [17]. A trial in Canada also demonstrated that planting bigleaf lupine in apple orchards resulted in a significant enhancement of reproductive success for blue orchard mason bees [17]. However, one trial in the Netherlands indicated that bee numbers and species richness do not increase in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches [17]. Additionally, two trials in Germany found no or relatively few species of solitary bee nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover [17]. There is no evidence that increasing the use of clover leys enhances wild bee populations [16], and no evidence has been captured for the effects of introducing nest boxes stocked with solitary bees on farmland wildlife [81].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}

One small replicated trial showed that common long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants [19]. Three trials in the UK found evidence that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in their value to bumblebees and would need to be re-sown every few years [18].\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
