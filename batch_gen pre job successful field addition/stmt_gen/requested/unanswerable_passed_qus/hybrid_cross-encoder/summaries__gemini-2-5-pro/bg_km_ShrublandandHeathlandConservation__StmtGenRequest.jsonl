[Statement n]: ... where the n is the statement number.\nquestion: What is the most cost-effective method for controlling invasive bracken in shrublands?\nanswer: No studies were found that evaluated the effects of controlling bracken by applying herbicide and sowing seed (1658) or by cutting and burning (1655). One trial in Norway and a study in the UK found that cutting bracken increased the cover or biomass of heather, while two other studies in the UK found no increase in heather cover or seedling abundance (1653). One UK study found that cutting bracken increased the species richness of heathland plants, but another UK study found it increased species diversity but not richness (1653). Cutting bracken was found to increase the cover of wavy hair-grass and sheep's fescue in one UK study, but another UK study found it did not increase the abundance of gorse or common cow-wheat (1653). The effect of cutting on bracken cover or biomass was also mixed, with some studies in Norway and the UK showing a reduction, one UK study showing mixed effects, and another UK study showing no decrease in abundance (1---).\nStatements:"}]}], "generation_config": {"thinking_config": {"thinking_budget": 8192}}}}
