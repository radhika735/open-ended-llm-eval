    "question": "What is the most cost-effective way to control problematic plants on peatlands?",
    "answer": "This question cannot be answered. The provided information evaluates the ecological effectiveness of various conservation actions but does not contain any data on their costs or cost-effectiveness. Therefore, a comparison of the financial implications of different methods for controlling problematic plants, such as physical removal, mowing, prescribed fire, or herbicide use, is not possible.",

    "question": "What is the combined effect on peatland vegetation of changing both the type of livestock and the season of grazing?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable because the database provides no evidence for either action individually. For both 'Change type of livestock' (1736) and 'Change season/timing of livestock grazing' (1737), the synopsis states, 'We found no studies that evaluated the effects, on peatland vegetation'. Consequently, there is no information available to assess their combined effect.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered by the provided text. While the text mentions beavers as a potential wild herbivore that can impact peatlands (1860, 1861), it provides no specific studies on their impact, particularly in the Patagonian region. The actions related to wild herbivores ('Exclude wild herbivores using physical barriers' and 'Control populations of wild herbivores') either have 'Unknown effectiveness' or 'No evidence found', and none of the summarized studies are from Patagonia or focus on beavers.",

    "question": "What are the long-term effects (over 30 years) of using prescribed fire to control problematic plants on bog vegetation composition?",
    "answer": "This question is unanswerable. The provided text summarizes studies on using prescribed fire to control problematic plants (1774), but the studies mentioned have shorter timeframes. For instance, one study reports effects after 2-7 months, while another reports effects after 8-18 years. No study mentioned provides data on the ecological outcomes of this intervention over a period as long as 30 years, making it impossible to determine the long-term effects on vegetation composition.",
