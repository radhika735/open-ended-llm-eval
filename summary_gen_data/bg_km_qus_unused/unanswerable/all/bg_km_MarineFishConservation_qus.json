    "answer": "This question cannot be answered because the provided evidence base contains no studies that have evaluated the effects of this specific intervention. The action \"Release males of species known to guard nests during breeding season\" (2734) is listed, but the key message explicitly states, \"We found no studies that evaluated the effects of releasing males that guard nests during the breeding season on marine fish populations.\" Therefore, there is no evidence to indicate whether this action is effective or harmful.",

    "answer": "This question cannot be answered using the provided text. While the effectiveness of ceasing or prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area (action 2682) is discussed in detail with respect to ecological outcomes like fish abundance and diversity, none of the studies mention the financial costs associated with implementing or maintaining these protected areas. The database does not contain information on cost-effectiveness, making a comparison or determination impossible.",
