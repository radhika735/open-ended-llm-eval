    "question": "How do the effects of selective logging compare to tree thinning on understory plants and young trees?",
    "answer": "Both selective logging and thinning can be beneficial for understory plants. Five of ten studies found logging increased the density and cover of understory plants (1273), while seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning did the same (1211). For young trees, the evidence differs. Thinning was found to increase the density of young trees in six of twelve studies (1210). In contrast, the evidence for logging is more limited and mixed, with one study finding it increased young tree density and another finding mixed effects (1272).",

    "question": "What are the effects of using prescribed fire as a management tool in forests, particularly in the USA, on mature trees, young trees, and understory vegetation?",
    "answer": "Evidence from the USA indicates that prescribed fire has mixed and often harmful effects. For mature trees, it is 'Likely to be ineffective or harmful', with studies finding it decreased tree cover and density and increased tree mortality (1217). For young trees, there is a 'Trade off between benefit and harms', with some studies finding fire increased density while others found it decreased density or had no effect (1220). The effect on understory plants is also a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. While fourteen of 24 studies found fire increased species richness and diversity, eight of 22 studies found it increased cover and density, but six found it decreased plant cover (1221).",

    "answer": "Several actions can be taken after a wildfire. Thinning trees in burnt areas has been found to increase plant species richness in Spain and aspen sapling cover in Canada, but it decreased plant biomass in one US study and pine seedling mortality in an Israeli study (1234). Removing burned trees was found to increase total plant species richness in one Israeli study and the cover of some species in Spain (1237). Conversely, sowing seeds after a wildfire was found to be likely ineffective or harmful, with some US studies showing it decreased native species and tree seedlings (1236).
