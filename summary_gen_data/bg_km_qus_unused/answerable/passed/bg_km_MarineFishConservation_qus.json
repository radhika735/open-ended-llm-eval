    "question": "In the North Sea, which gear modifications have shown the most success in reducing unwanted fish catch?",
    "answer": "Several gear modifications have been studied in the North Sea. Three studies found that using an electric or pulse trawl reduced catches of non-target or undersized fish compared to standard trawls (2713). Similarly, three studies concluded that shrimp trawls fitted with a sieve net reduced unwanted fish catches (2722). Other methods have also demonstrated positive results, such as using a separator trawl to allow smaller unwanted cod to escape (2711) and using a topless trawl, which reduced discards of commercial fish species (2712).",

    "question": "What are the documented population-level outcomes of establishing long-term fishery closures?",
    "answer": "Evidence from five studies on long-term fishery closures shows varied effects on fish populations (2655). Regarding abundance, results were mixed: one study found a higher abundance for only one of seven species, while another found more young salmon but similar numbers of older salmon. For fish condition, one study reported that young salmon returning to rivers had higher weights after a closure, but another study found smaller monkfish inside a closed area compared to an open one.",

    "answer": "Prohibiting all mobile and static gears targeting bottom species (2654) was found in one study to result in higher numbers of larger, older cod and better cod growth after 15 years. Prohibiting only mobile bottom-towed gears (2673) also showed positive effects in some studies, including higher total fish biomass after 15 years and increased biomass and recruitment of red mullet after 14 years. However, studies for both interventions also found cases with no effect or mixed effects on fish abundance and condition, suggesting outcomes can be variable.",

    "answer": "The evidence base for prohibiting spearfishing consists of five studies (2672). These studies primarily examined population responses. Three site-comparison studies and one review found that prohibiting spearfishing, sometimes along with line fishing, increased the abundance and size of various reef fish, seabass, and seabream. One study also found that prohibiting spearfishing in specific zones of a marine reserve resulted in higher commercial and recreational fishery catches of a targeted species compared to zones that allowed spearfishing.",

    "answer": "Several studies in the North Atlantic have examined catch limits. Introducing overall catch limits (Total Allowable Catch) was found to increase the abundance of Atlantic herring and halibut and reduce fishing mortality (3811). A review found that setting catch limits for non-targeted commercial species reduced unwanted catch in two of three cases (2693). Establishing 'move-on' rules tied to catch thresholds reduced overall fishing effort and commercial landings for cod (3815). However, a ban on high-grading did not eliminate the discarding of legal-sized but unwanted common megrim (3823).",

However, a separate study in the Indian Ocean found that co-management did lead to an increase in overall fish abundance after nine years (2910).",
