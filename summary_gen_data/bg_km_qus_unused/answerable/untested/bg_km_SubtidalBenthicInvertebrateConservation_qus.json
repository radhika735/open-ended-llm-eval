    "answer": "Several management options exist to mitigate the impacts of oil and gas drilling, although no studies were found that evaluated their effects on subtidal benthic invertebrate populations. These options include ceasing or prohibiting drilling (2061), ceasing or prohibiting the deposit of drill cuttings on the seabed (2062), disposing of drill cuttings on land (2063) or burying them in the seabed (2066), removing drill cuttings after decommissioning (2064), limiting the thickness of drill cuttings (2065), using water-based instead of oil-based drilling muds (2067), and recycling or repurposing drilling fluids (2069).",

    "answer": "Based on the available evidence, ceasing or prohibiting aggregate extraction is a beneficial action (2070). Studies found that after ceasing extraction, invertebrate community composition, species richness, and abundance generally recovered to become more similar to pre-extraction or natural, undisturbed sites. In contrast, extracting aggregates from a moving vessel has 'Unknown effectiveness' (2071), and no evidence was found for the effectiveness of setting limits on sediment particle size change (2072), limiting sediment discard (2073), or removing discarded sediment (2074).",

Prohibiting bottom trawling (2099) was found in studies to result in different invertebrate community compositions and higher diversity compared to trawled areas. Prohibiting dredging (2101) also showed benefits, with one study reporting higher diversity of large invertebrates and increased abundance of several species including bryozoans, spider crabs, sea fans, and sponges in areas where dredging had ceased, although other studies found community composition remained similar.",

Fitting trawl nets with a sievenet appeared to catch fewer unwanted non-commercial invertebrates (2131). Adding one or more mesh escape panels or windows had varied effects, with some studies finding a reduction in unwanted invertebrate catch while others found mixed effects or similar amounts of catch compared to unmodified nets, depending on the panel design (2132). Similarly, modifying the arrangement of tickler chains had mixed results, with some arrangements reducing unwanted catch and others having no effect (2140).",

In the North Sea (Firth of Clyde), a no-take MPA had a different community composition of small sessile invertebrates compared to fished areas after five years, but large invertebrate communities were similar (2224).

    "answer": "Recovery times vary depending on the activity that is stopped. After ceasing aggregate extraction, a global review found it could take anywhere from nine months to several decades for invertebrate community composition to recover (2070). Following fisheries closures, recovery can also be a long process. For example, after prohibiting commercial fishing for 28 years, an area showed different invertebrate communities and greater biological production than a fished area (2097). Prohibiting trawling for 15 to 20 years also resulted in different community compositions (2099). Areas closed to all towed fishing gear for between two and 23 years had different community compositions and greater biomass compared to fished areas (2102).",

Creating artificial reefs was found to be likely beneficial, with studies showing they host diverse invertebrate communities (2258). However, the community composition on artificial reefs can differ from natural reefs, and species richness may sometimes be lower. In one study in the Firth of Lorn, UK, artificial reefs supported higher abundances of edible crabs and velvet swimming crabs than natural reefs (2258).",

In MPAs that prohibit all fishing, higher lobster abundances were found after four to 33 years, though some studies found no difference after one to seven years (2224). After 15 years in one no-take MPA, invertebrate species richness remained stable while it decreased in fished sites (2224).
