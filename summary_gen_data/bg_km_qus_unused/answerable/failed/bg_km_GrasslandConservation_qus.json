    "question": "What site preparation techniques can be used before seeding to improve the establishment of grassland plants?",
    "answer": "Several site preparation techniques have been studied. Disturbing the soil before seeding has been found to increase plant emergence in most cases (3413). Removing topsoil before seeding can increase plant community similarity to target grasslands, increase species richness, and improve plant survival (3415). Applying herbicide before seeding has been shown to increase sown species richness and the cover of sown grass species (3418). Simply removing vegetation has also been found to increase the germination rate of sown species in one study (3416).",

    "question": "To increase plant species richness in a degraded European grassland, which sowing interventions appear most effective based on available evidence?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests sowing seeds of parasitic species like yellow rattle is highly effective; five of six studies in Europe found this increased plant species richness or diversity (3404). Sowing native grass and forb seeds has also been effective, with sixteen of twenty-eight studies (many in Europe) finding it increased overall plant species richness (3432). Using seeds from a local source was also found to increase plant species richness compared to a commercial mix in one Italian study (3400). In contrast, sowing only grass seeds has been found to either not change or reduce overall plant species richness in three of four studies (3397).",

    "question": "What are the potential negative impacts of sowing grass seeds on native grassland vegetation?",
    "answer": "Sowing grass seeds can have several negative impacts. Studies have found that this action can reduce overall plant species richness (3397). It may also reduce the abundance of desirable native species, with evidence showing reductions in the abundance of characteristic grassland species, native grass cover, native forb abundance, and shrub abundance (3397). Similarly, sowing grass seeds at a higher density was found to reduce the cover of native grassland shrubs in one study (3405).",

Increasing the number of species in the seed mix itself was found to increase the richness of sown plants in two studies (3406). Another strategy is to use seeds from a local source, which one study found increased plant species richness compared to a commercial seed mix (3400). In contrast, sowing seeds of nurse plants on their own did not change species richness and reduced community similarity to intact steppe in one study (3401).",

    "answer": "Two methods described in the evidence are slot/strip seeding and sowing into prepared gaps. Slot or strip seeding involves drilling seeds into shallow slots, which one UK study found increased grass and forb species richness, though another review noted it often resulted in failed introductions of sown species (3411). The other method involves sowing seeds into prepared gaps within existing vegetation; a study in Hungary found this led to a greater cover of sown target plants when using large gaps compared to smaller ones (3409).",

    "answer": "The evidence suggests that the effects of sowing seeds can change over time. For species richness, one study found that sowing grass and forb seeds increased richness in the first year, but this effect disappeared after 3â€“13 years, while another found richness was higher than unsown areas only after eight years (3432). For vegetation cover, one study found that sowing grass seeds led to higher cover after two years, but this difference was gone after seven years (3397). For community composition, studies on both sowing only grass (3397) and sowing grass/forb mixes (3432) found that, over time, sown areas could become more similar to intact grasslands.",

However, other studies found that while sowing native grass and forb seeds increased species richness in the first year, after 3-13 years there was no difference or richness was lower compared to unsown areas (3432). Another study found that after seven years, there was no difference in grass cover between areas where grass seeds were sown and where they were not, despite an initial increase (3397).",

Mechanically removing existing vegetation increased the germination rate of sown species in one study (3416).
