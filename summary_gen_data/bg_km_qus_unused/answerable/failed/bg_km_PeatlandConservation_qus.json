    "question": "What physical interventions, other than planting, can be used to encourage natural vegetation recovery on degraded peatlands?",
    "answer": "Several physical interventions can be used to create conditions suitable for natural peatland plant colonization without active planting. These include filling or blocking ditches, which has been shown to be colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years in some studies and is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (1805). Removing the upper layer of peat or soil is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies in fens showing it can increase cover of characteristic plants and overall species richness (1809). Other options with 'Unknown effectiveness' include excavating pools (1806), reprofiling the landscape (1807), and disturbing the peat surface to encourage desirable plants (1811).",

    "question": "What techniques are available to restore vegetation on peatlands after peat extraction, and what are their reported outcomes?",
    "answer": "Two specific techniques have been evaluated for restoring vegetation after peat extraction. Replacing blocks of intact peatland vegetation is one method, with studies showing that transplanted blocks retained their original plant community, as well as Sphagnum and shrub cover (1738). Another technique is the moss layer transfer technique, which involves rewetting, reprofiling, and adding plant fragments, mulch, and fertilizer; this has been found to successfully establish bog-characteristic plant communities and increase vegetation cover and species richness (1804).",

Diverting or replacing polluted water sources is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing this increased cover of Sphagnum and other mosses characteristic of low nutrient levels (1779). Other actions with 'Unknown effectiveness' include cleaning waste water before it enters the environment and slowing down input water; single studies on each found these actions also increased cover of low-nutrient moss species and decreased vascular plant biomass (1778, 1780). No studies were found evaluating the effects of creating buffer zones or reducing fertilizer use near peatlands (1781, 1783).",

    "answer": "Applying surface covers to degraded bogs has shown variable but often positive effects. When used after planting, organic mulches like straw are 'Likely to be beneficial', with several studies showing increased cover of sown vegetation, including Sphagnum (1828). Similarly, artificial covers like plastic mesh are also 'Likely to be beneficial' after planting, with studies reporting increased cover of planted mosses (1829). However, some studies for both mulch and artificial covers found no effect on vegetation cover (1828, 1829). When used without planting, evidence is weaker; one study found plastic mesh increased native plant and Sphagnum cover on burned bogs, while other studies on mulch or fibre mats found no effect on vegetation cover (1813, 1814).",

Using multiple interventions (more than three) has been found to increase moss and herb cover, but restored areas may still differ from natural peatlands (1803). The moss layer transfer technique, a specific combination of five steps, has been shown to successfully establish bog-characteristic plant communities and increase moss and herb cover compared to unrestored areas (1804).",

Financial incentives, such as paying landowners, have had mixed success in protecting bog habitat area (1799).
