    "question": "What actions are available to reduce crop-raiding by primates on agricultural land?",
    "answer": "Several actions to reduce crop-raiding have been studied. Removing and relocating ‘problem’ animals is rated as ‘likely to be beneficial’, with studies showing that translocated monkeys and gorillas survived and remained at release sites (1422). Humans chasing primates using random loud noise is also ‘likely to be beneficial’; studies found this reduced crop raiding by orangutans and encouraged gorillas to leave plantations (1449). Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees has ‘unknown effectiveness’, but one study in Indonesia did find that it reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). Other interventions, such as installing mechanical barriers like fences (1436) or using natural hedges (1437), currently have no evidence to assess their effects on primate populations.",

    "question": "Within logging concessions in Central Africa, what are the most beneficial law enforcement strategies to protect great ape populations?",
    "answer": "Several law enforcement strategies have been shown to be beneficial. Conducting regular anti-poaching patrols is rated ‘likely to be beneficial’, with two studies in Rwanda finding that gorilla populations increased after implementing patrols (1471). Providing anti-poaching patrols with better equipment is also ‘likely to be beneficial’; studies found that gorilla populations increased and no gorillas were killed for a period after guards were better equipped (1476). Finally, implementing community control of patrolling is ‘likely to be beneficial’. One study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found community control was more effective at reducing illegal hunting than patrols in a nearby national park, and another in Nigeria found more gorillas and chimpanzees in a community-managed area (1482).",

    "answer": "Several actions are available. To improve habitat connectivity, rope or pole bridges can be installed; studies have shown these are used by multiple primate species and can lead to population increases (1457). Green overpasses are another option, though no evidence was found for their effect on primate populations (1456). To manage traffic, interventions include implementing speed limits (1458), reducing road widths (1459), imposing fines (1460), installing speed bumps (1465), and providing signage (1466), although no evidence was found for the effectiveness of these specific traffic management actions on primate populations. Avoiding road construction in key habitats is also a preventative option, but it also lacks evidence (1461).",

Allowing primates an adaptation period at the release site has been associated with population increases in one study but declines or low survival in others (1564). Reintroducing primates in social groups has similarly shown both increases and declines in populations post-release (1567). The captive background of individuals appears influential; primates born and reared in cages had higher mortality or different diets compared to wild-born individuals (1594), whereas those with limited or full free-ranging experience showed diets more similar to their wild counterparts (1595, 1596). Fostering appropriate behaviours has also shown mixed results (1600).

Communities can implement their own no-hunting policies or traditional hunting bans, which have been associated with increased populations of gorillas and Sclater's monkeys and reduced killing of snub-nosed monkeys (1478). Another strategy is to strengthen, support, or re-install local taboos that forbid killing primates; this was linked to higher densities of Laotian black crested gibbons where such a taboo existed (1479). Additionally, communities can take direct control of anti-poaching activities, which one study found to be more effective at reducing illegal hunting than management in a nearby national park (1482).",

    "question": "What are the benefits and negative impacts of providing supplementary resources like food, water, or nesting sites to primates?",
    "answer": "Provisioning supplementary resources yields mixed results. Regular supplementary feeding was associated with primate population increases in two studies but declines in two others (1526). Feeding only during resource-scarce periods was linked to high survival in reintroduced chimpanzees and baboons (1527). Providing artificial water sources was part of interventions where a minority of reintroduced primates survived (1531). Providing artificial nesting sites showed negative impacts for lion tamarins, which experienced population declines, but positive impacts for juvenile gorillas, which had high survival rates when nesting platforms were provided (1530).",

    "question": "Within agricultural landscapes, what non-lethal deterrents, other than installing mechanical fences, can farmers use to discourage primates?",
    "answer": "Beyond mechanical fences (1436), farmers can use active deterrents. Using noise deterrents and chasing primates was found to reduce crop raiding by orangutans and cause gorillas to return to protected forests (1449). In Indonesia, using nets to protect individual crop trees also reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). No direct evidence was found for the effectiveness of several other non-lethal methods, including using natural thorny hedges (1437), planting unpalatable buffer crops (1438), strategically deploying predator scents (1448), or chasing primates with dogs (1444).",

    "answer": "The evidence for pre-release health interventions is mixed and outcomes are inconsistent. Veterinary screening before release was a protocol in numerous studies with varied results, from high survival in orangutans to high mortality in gibbons (1553). Similarly, treating sick or injured animals was associated with high survival in studies on chimpanzees and gorillas but high mortality in studies on golden lion tamarins and lar gibbons (1550). Treating for internal or external parasites was linked to high survival for chimpanzees and gorillas but high mortality for mandrills and pygmy slow lorises (1551). Quarantine before release also showed inconsistent outcomes, being associated with high survival for some reintroduced gorillas but high mortality for golden lion tamarins (1541).",
