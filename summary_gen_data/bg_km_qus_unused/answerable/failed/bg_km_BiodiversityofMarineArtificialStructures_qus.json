    "answer": "Evidence suggests that creating hole habitats (>50 mm) can increase the abundance of some mobile invertebrates like brown crabs (3434). Additionally, using certain environmentally-sensitive materials, such as shell-concrete, has been found to increase bivalve abundance (3470). However, other interventions, such as creating grooves or pits, have shown mixed effects on invertebrate abundance (3448, 3455).",

Nine out of twelve studies in locations including Australia, the UK, Spain, and Malaysia found that rock pools supported higher combined species richness of macroalgae, invertebrates, and/or fish compared to structure surfaces without them (3476).

On intertidal structures, creating rock pools and/or holes increased species diversity and supported species absent from other surfaces (3476, 3467). Creating grooves and small ledges had mixed results, with grooves supporting higher richness than ledges (3464, 3473). Reducing a structure's slope showed conflicting results between studies (3461). Transplanting oysters had mixed effects on richness but could increase mobile invertebrate abundance (3472). On subtidal structures, creating short (3450) or long (3451) flexible habitats had mixed effects on invertebrate and seahorse abundance, while reducing the cleaned area of a structure increased seahorse abundance (3447).",

At a larger scale, creating natural rocky reef topography has been tested, with mixed effects on invertebrate abundance on intertidal structures (3435) and no increase in macroalgal abundance in one subtidal study (3446).
