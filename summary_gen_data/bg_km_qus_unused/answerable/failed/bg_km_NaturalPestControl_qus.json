    "answer": "The evidence suggests two 'likely to be beneficial' actions. Growing non-crop plants that produce attractive chemicals was found to increase the numbers of natural enemies in three out of four studies (724). Similarly, using manufactured attractive chemicals, such as pheromones and volatiles, was found to attract more natural enemies in multiple studies, although effects sometimes varied between enemy groups or the chemicals used (754).",

Using mixed pastures instead of monocultures reduced weeds in two studies (721). Converting to organic farming, however, was found in three studies to result in more weeds (717).

One study found that incorporating parasitism rates into these threshold decisions also resulted in acceptable crop damage levels (726).

Using chemical attractants for natural enemies also increased parasitism in a review and two of five studies (754). Other interventions show more variable results. Excluding pest-protecting ants increased parasitism in one of two studies (886), while converting to organic farming showed an increase in only one of five studies (717).

Using mixed pasture instead of monoculture is also promising, with two studies both finding a reduction in weeds (721). In contrast, converting to organic farming appears less reliable, as three studies found it led to more weeds (717).

For altering insecticide use, success is linked to timing applications to periods of crop susceptibility (723). The choice of insecticide is also a factor, as effects can vary between chemical types (723). For delaying mowing or grazing, the outcome for natural enemies is inconsistent and depends heavily on the specific predator group being considered; studies found negative, neutral, or mixed effects for different groups (727). Similarly, delaying herbicide use has variable success depending on the pest group and crop variety, with one study finding different outcomes for pests and crop damage under different conditions (774).",

Managing ant populations can also be effective; for example, isolating colonies of beneficial predatory ants in cashew trees led to lower pest damage and higher yields (773).

    "question": "In arable farming systems, what are some alternatives to crop rotation for reducing pest populations?",
    "answer": "System-wide changes like converting to organic farming or using alley cropping are potential alternatives to crop rotation for pest management, but the evidence for their effectiveness on pests is mixed. While crop rotation was found to reduce pests and diseases in three studies and a review (719), the evidence for alternatives is less clear. For organic farming, only one of eight studies found it reduced pests or disease, while two studies found more pests and three reported mixed effects (717). For alley cropping, two of four studies found more pests in alley cropped plots, one found fewer pests, and another found effects varied (718).",

    "question": "For which natural pest control interventions is there evidence about the duration of their effects?",
    "answer": "There is evidence on the duration of effects for at least two interventions, both of which suggest that positive outcomes can be short-lived. For incorporating plant remains into the soil to control weeds, two studies found that the reduction in weeds did not last beyond a few days or weeks (728). For using pesticides only when pests reach threshold levels, one study found that this regime increased natural enemy numbers, but the effects lasted for as little as three weeks (750).",
