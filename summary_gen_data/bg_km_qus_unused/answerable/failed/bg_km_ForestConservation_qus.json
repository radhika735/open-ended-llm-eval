Fencing to exclude grazing animals is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with four of five studies finding it increased the survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). Watering seedlings increased survival during a dry summer in one study in Spain (1154). Using plastic tree shelters also increased survival rates in a US study (1268).

    "answer": "The evidence level varies significantly depending on the herbivore. There is no evidence for the effect of controlling large (1198) or medium-sized (1200) herbivore populations. For rodents, the effectiveness is unknown, with one study finding that rodent control actually decreased native plant species richness (1232). In contrast, excluding herbivores with fencing appears more promising. Using wire fences to exclude large native herbivores is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing increased understory plant cover and tree density (1230). Similarly, excluding livestock with fences is also 'Likely to be beneficial' for understory plants and regenerating trees (1205).",

Using shelterwood harvesting instead of clearcutting was found in three studies to result in higher plant diversity and tree species density (1214). More broadly, shelterwood harvesting was found to increase the abundance, richness, and diversity of understory plants, as well as the growth and survival of young trees in six of seven studies (1223). Group-selection harvesting also showed positive results, with four of eight studies finding it increased the cover and diversity of understory plants and the density of young trees (1224).
