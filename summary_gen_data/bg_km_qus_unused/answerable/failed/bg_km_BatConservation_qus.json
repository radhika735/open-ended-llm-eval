    "question": "In an agricultural landscape, what are the effects of different habitat and farming management practices on bat populations?",
    "answer": "The effects vary by practice. Organic farming is considered 'likely to be beneficial', with several studies finding higher bat activity or more species on organic farms compared to conventional ones (961). Similarly, agroforestry systems with shade trees are 'likely to be beneficial', supporting more bats and higher diversity than unshaded monocultures (963). In contrast, agri-environment schemes in the UK were found to be 'unlikely to be beneficial', with studies showing no difference or even lower bat activity compared to conventional farms (962). Maintaining smaller fields (1939) and planting diverse field margins (1941) were found to increase bat activity for some species, while retaining unmown field margins (1940) and managing hedges (1943) showed mixed or no significant effects in the studies found.",

    "question": "What are the known benefits and negative impacts of providing artificial roosts for bats?",
    "answer": "The primary benefit is that bats are known to use a variety of artificial roosts. This includes bat boxes, with 41 of 43 studies finding they were used (1024), and artificial caves or hibernacula, which were used in all four studies found (2049). However, there are significant drawbacks. Occupancy rates can be low; 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (1024). When used to replace destroyed roosts during developments, bats may not use the new structures at all, or may use them in lower numbers, with new roosts being four times less likely to be used than retained ones (949). Furthermore, certain designs or features, such as heated bat boxes, may not be used by target species like maternity colonies (2052).",

Restoring wetlands is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with one study in the USA finding it increased overall bat activity to levels similar to undisturbed wetlands (2036). The effectiveness of other restoration types is less certain. Restoring ex-quarry sites has 'Unknown effectiveness', though one study found higher bat activity 10 years after restoration (2286). Restoring forest or woodland also has 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found restored forest had lower bat diversity than native forest, while another found restored forest had similar or higher bat activity than unmined forests (2050).

Studies found that farms with few or no chemical inputs had higher bat diversity, abundance, and better body condition for bats compared to farms with high chemical inputs (2013). In contrast, changing effluent treatments from domestic and urban waste water has 'Unknown effectiveness'. One study found higher bat activity over filter bed sewage works than active sludge systems, but no studies assessed the impact on bat populations (1014).

Using selective or reduced impact logging (989) and retaining forested corridors in logged areas (996) are also rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies indicating these practices have smaller negative effects on abundance and that corridors are used for roosting and foraging. Practices with 'Unknown effectiveness' include retaining residual tree patches, which had mixed results on bat activity (995), and using shelterwood cutting, where one study found it provided more roosts than another cutting method (990). There is a significant evidence gap for several key actions, with 'No evidence found' for protecting individual roost trees (1982), retaining buffers around roost trees (1983), or changing the timing of forestry operations (1984).",

Installing gates at cave and mine entrances to restrict human access is rated as a 'Trade off between benefit and harms'. While gates can lead to population increases by reducing disturbance (999), they can also cause declines, alter bat behaviour, and lead to collisions, with gate design being a critical factor (1963, 999). Installing fencing around cave entrances is rated 'Unknown effectiveness'; one study found it did not affect population growth, while another found more bats emerged after a gate was replaced with a fence (1991). Managing the microclimate can be beneficial, with one study showing that modifying a mine's microclimate led to more hibernating bats (1964). However, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of restoring the microclimate in modified caves (1001).",

Retaining existing bat roosts and access points is considered 'Likely to be beneficial', as studies show these are more likely to be successfully used by bats post-development compared to new structures (947). Creating alternative roosts like bat barns or lofts has 'Unknown effectiveness' due to highly variable outcomes; some are used by colonies in similar numbers to the original roost, but many others are used by fewer bats or not at all (949). Other actions with 'Unknown effectiveness' include relocating access points, which had mixed results (946), and changing the timing of building work to avoid sensitive periods, which in one study resulted in continued roost use when combined with retaining access points (950).

    "question": "What are the most effective types of artificial roosts for bats?",
    "answer": "Based on effectiveness ratings, providing bat boxes [1024] and creating artificial caves or hibernacula [2049] are both considered 'Likely to be beneficial'. Forty-one of 43 studies found bats used bat boxes, and studies on artificial caves showed use by multiple species with numbers increasing over time. In contrast, creating alternative roosts within developments [949] is rated as 'Unknown effectiveness', as studies show mixed results and they are less likely to be used than retained roosts.",

    "question": "What design and placement factors are associated with higher occupancy rates of artificial bat roosts?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence the success of artificial roosts. For bat boxes, design features such as a black color, larger size, and materials like concrete or resin can be preferable [1024]. Positioning is also critical; studies found that orientation, sun exposure, and height can affect occupancy, with placement on buildings sometimes being more successful than on trees [1024]. Furthermore, installing a greater number of bat boxes across a site increases the likelihood of occupation [1024]. For artificial roosts in buildings, managing the microclimate by reducing extreme internal temperatures has been shown to increase the number of bats using them [2052].",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests thinning trees within forests is likely to be beneficial, with multiple studies in the USA and Australia finding higher overall bat activity in thinned forests compared to unthinned ones (991). The use of selective or reduced impact logging has a likely beneficial rating, with studies finding it had a smaller effect on bat abundance than conventional logging and resulted in different bat species compositions (989). The effectiveness of shelterwood cutting is unknown; one study found more of one bat species roosting in shelterwood harvested forests than in forests harvested using another method, but no comparison was made with clearcutting (990).",

    "question": "Besides installing crossing structures, what other actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on bats?",
    "answer": "To mitigate road impacts without installing physical structures, several actions can be considered. Avoiding the illumination of bat commuting routes is rated as likely to be beneficial, as studies found greater activity of some bat species along unlit routes and that bats would change flight paths to avoid lights (2017). One study found that up to a fifth of bats in a colony used a newly created artificial hedgerow to commute, suggesting diverting bats with plantings may be effective, though its overall effectiveness is unknown (981). There is currently no evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing or improving habitat around roads (983).",

Restoring wetlands is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with one study finding it increased overall bat activity (2036). Other actions have less certain outcomes. Restoring foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites (2286), in urban areas (954), and restoring forests (2050) are all rated 'Unknown effectiveness', although individual studies reported increased bat activity in some restored sites compared to unrestored ones.",
