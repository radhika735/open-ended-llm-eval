    "question": "What options are available to enhance populations of pollinators and their natural enemies on Mediterranean farmland?",
    "answer": "Available actions include planting flowers and planting hedgerows. Planting flowers can increase the number of natural enemies and pollinators [1400, 1406]. Planting hedgerows has been shown to increase the numbers of natural enemies and bee species, and can lead to higher seed-set in nearby crops [1401, 1407].",

Adding pig slurry was found to increase crop yields in six studies (1349), and adding sewage sludge increased barley yields in one study (1348). However, adding compost produced inconsistent results, with some studies finding higher yields while others found similar or inconsistent outcomes (1346). Similarly, adding manure showed mixed results, with one study reporting higher maize yields and another finding no change in nectarine yields (1347).",

Adding compost was found to increase plant biomass and cover, and one study found rare plant species only in composted plots [1409]. Adding manure was found to increase plant species in one of three comparisons [1410]. Adding sewage sludge increased plant cover and tree growth but had no effect on the number of plant species [1411]. For other groups, one study found no difference in invertebrate biodiversity with added compost [1409].

Adding compost can be effective; two studies found more water in soil with added compost, and one found it reduced water loss from runoff [1377]. Growing cover crops has mixed results on soil water content, with some studies finding more and others less. However, five studies found that cover crops reduced water loss through drainage or runoff [1357].

One study noted that an endangered bird nested successfully in restored sites [1416]. In contrast, for planting hedgerows, no studies on bird populations were found [1415].
