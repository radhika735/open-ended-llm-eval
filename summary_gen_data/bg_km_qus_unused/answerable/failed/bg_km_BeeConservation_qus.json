    "question": "For supporting bumblebees on UK farmland, what is the difference in effectiveness between sowing field margins with agricultural nectar mixes versus native wildflower mixes?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests a trade-off depending on the goal. Three replicated trials showed that a mix of agricultural forage plants attracts a greater number of bumblebees than a perennial wildflower mix, at least in the first year (18). However, a separate small trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over a mix of annual forage plants (19). It is also noted that margins sown with agricultural legume plants can degrade in value for bumblebees and may need to be re-sown every few years (18).",

    "answer": "Different methods are effective for different bee groups. For bumblebees, one trial showed that grassy field margins attract nest-searching queens (12), and for artificial sites, multiple trials indicate that buried underground nest boxes are generally the most effective, showing higher occupancy rates than surface-level wooden boxes (48). For ground-nesting solitary bees, several small trials have shown that artificially created patches of bare soil can be successfully colonized (13). Many other solitary bee species readily occupy artificial nest boxes, such as bundles of hollow stems or blocks of wood drilled with holes (47).",

Fourteen trials have shown that planting dedicated floral resources, such as phacelia or perennial herbs, attracts substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, with one trial showing it enhanced reproductive success for a solitary bee species (17). Sowing uncropped field margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes has been shown in four replicated trials to attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). Furthermore, four trials in Europe have demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally managed land (24).",

    "answer": "Evidence supports two main actions in domestic gardens. The first is planting appropriate flowers. Two trials in North America found more wild bees (either more species or more individuals) in gardens planted with bee forage or native plants compared to conventionally managed gardens (1). A UK trial also noted that some popular non-native or horticulturally modified flowers are not frequently visited by insects (1). The second action is to practice lower-intensity management. A UK study found more species of bumblebee in gardens with less intensive management, which reflected the garden's tidiness and the use of pesticides (2).",

Translocating existing bumblebee colonies has shown negative impacts, including queen death and lower productivity in two out of three small trials (53).
