    "answer": "Several actions are beneficial for re-establishing amphibian populations. Creating new ponds is rated as beneficial, as studies found amphibians colonized and established stable populations in them (869). Restoring existing ponds is also likely to be beneficial, with studies showing increased populations and species numbers (878). Translocating amphibians from other sites is likely beneficial, with one review showing that 65% of translocations resulted in established breeding populations (854). Similarly, releasing captive-bred amphibians is rated as likely to be beneficial (871).",

    "answer": "Some interventions show a trade-off between benefits and harms. For instance, while adding lime to water bodies can reduce acidification, some studies found it also caused high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment (748). Using the pesticide rotenone to eliminate predatory fish successfully increased amphibian abundance in some studies, but it was also observed to cause deaths in frogs and negative effects in newts (828). Treating the disease chytridiomycosis with certain fungicides can be an effective cure, but these treatments have also been found to cause death or other negative side effects in some amphibians (882).",

For instance, managing ditches as part of agri-environment schemes resulted in significantly higher amphibian abundance and species numbers (749). Paying farmers for conservation measures, which can include habitat creation, has also been shown to increase frog and toad populations (818). The effects of grazing are less clear, with some studies showing benefits for certain toad species, while another found fewer common toads in grazed plots (780). One study found that reduced mowing was associated with an increase in frog species (783), while another found that planting new buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance (819).",

Temperature treatment is considered likely to be beneficial, as several studies demonstrated that increasing enclosure temperatures to 30–37°C cured frogs and toads of the disease (770). Direct application of specific antifungal treatments like itraconazole can also be effective, though some fungicides have negative side effects (882). In contrast, other approaches appear less successful. For example, using antibacterial treatments (763) and applying antifungal skin bacteria to amphibians (764) were both rated as unlikely to be beneficial, as most studies found they did not cure the infection.",

These include removing invasive American bullfrogs, which led to an increase in native frog populations (825), and removing predatory fish by catching them (827), using rotenone (828), or drying out ponds (826). All three fish removal methods were found to increase amphibian abundance or breeding success, although rotenone was also found to cause frog mortality (828). Additionally, the removal of invasive viperine snakes was shown to increase the number of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae (830), and controlling mammal predators is another potential action (839).",

These include pond age, whether the pond is permanent or temporary, the amount of vegetation cover, the nature of the surrounding landscape, the distance to existing ponds that can act as a source for colonization, and the presence or absence of predatory fish (869).

In an agricultural context, one study found that planting new buffer strips did not increase amphibian abundance or species numbers (819). Similarly, retaining unmown buffers around ponds had mixed effects on tadpole survival and mass (850). In contrast, an action to reduce shade by removing the tree canopy around ponds also had uncertain effects, helping establish a toad population in one study but not increasing salamander hatching success in another (758).",

For acidified water bodies, adding lime has been shown to increase egg and larval survival in some cases, but can also cause tadpole mortality (748).
