    "answer": "Several actions to reduce crop-raiding have been studied. Removing and relocating ‘problem’ animals is rated as ‘likely to be beneficial’, with studies showing that translocated monkeys and gorillas survived and remained at release sites (1422). Humans chasing primates using random loud noise is also ‘likely to be beneficial’; studies found this reduced crop raiding by orangutans and encouraged gorillas to leave plantations (1449). Using nets to keep primates out of fruit trees has ‘unknown effectiveness’, but one study in Indonesia did find that it reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). Other interventions, such as installing mechanical barriers like fences (1436) or using natural hedges (1437), currently have no evidence to assess their effects on primate populations.",

    "answer": "Several law enforcement strategies have been shown to be beneficial. Conducting regular anti-poaching patrols is rated ‘likely to be beneficial’, with two studies in Rwanda finding that gorilla populations increased after implementing patrols (1471). Providing anti-poaching patrols with better equipment is also ‘likely to be beneficial’; studies found that gorilla populations increased and no gorillas were killed for a period after guards were better equipped (1476). Finally, implementing community control of patrolling is ‘likely to be beneficial’. One study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found community control was more effective at reducing illegal hunting than patrols in a nearby national park, and another in Nigeria found more gorillas and chimpanzees in a community-managed area (1482).",

Studies have found that black lion tamarins, capuchins, and multiple lemur species used such bridges to cross roads or pipelines, and one study in Belize found a black howler monkey population increased after pole bridges were constructed. In contrast, for installing green bridges (overpasses), no evidence was found, and therefore no assessment of its effectiveness could be made (1456).",

Implementing local no-hunting community policies is rated as ‘likely to be beneficial’, with studies documenting population increases or protection for various primate species including lowland gorillas, black howler monkeys, and drills under local hunting bans (1478). Similarly, implementing community control of patrolling and snare removal is also ‘likely to be beneficial’. Evidence includes a study where community control was more effective at reducing illegal hunting than a national park, and another that found higher densities of gorillas and chimpanzees in a community-managed area (1482). The evidence for strengthening local taboos that forbid killing primates is less certain, with an ‘unknown effectiveness’ rating, though one study found higher gibbon densities in an area with a hunting taboo (1479).",

On the positive side, several studies found that mountain gorilla numbers increased after tourism projects were initiated. One study also found an increase in black howler monkey numbers. On the negative side, tourism has been associated with decreases in Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers, and declines in population, body size, or group size for some lemur species. A study on Tibetan macaques found that an intensive tourism project increased their stress levels and led to very high infant mortality. Habituation itself (1519) has been part of successful gorilla population increases but also a tamarin population decline. The risks associated with tourism and habituation have led to management actions like keeping a safety distance from animals (1538) and implementing no-feeding policies (1502).",

    "question": "What forms of long-term human presence and monitoring are associated with the survival of reintroduced or translocated primate populations?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several forms of human presence are associated with primate survival, with mixed results. The presence of a research project with continuous monitoring was associated with increased numbers of mountain gorillas and the survival of reintroduced chimpanzees and baboons (1511). The permanent presence of reserve staff was linked to an increase in black howler monkey numbers in one study, but a decrease in Tana River red colobus and crested mangabey numbers in another (1517). In one case, guarding habituated primate groups against poachers was associated with an increase in a mountain gorilla population (1523).",

    "answer": "The evidence for financial incentives is limited and mixed. For interventions such as compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates (1428) or paying them to cover the costs of non-harmful deterrents (1429), no studies were found to have tested their effects. For the broader strategy of providing monetary benefits to local communities for sustainable forest management, one study found that numbers of black howler monkeys increased, while another study found mountain gorilla numbers declined despite development projects in nearby communities (1509).",

Preventative vaccination showed benefits, with one study finding decreased mortality in rhesus macaques and others showing high survival rates in reintroduced chimpanzees and gorillas (1549). Treating sick or injured animals has shown highly mixed results; studies report high survival for chimpanzees and gorillas, but high mortality for golden lion tamarins and lar gibbons (1550). Similarly, treating primates for parasites was associated with high survival in some chimpanzee and gorilla studies but high mortality in studies of tamarins, mandrills, and lorises (1551).",

    "answer": "Studies suggest primates with free-ranging experience may adapt better to the wild. One controlled study found that reintroduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs with limited or full free-ranging experience had diets that overlapped with wild lemurs, while those born and reared in cages did not (1595, 1596, 1594). However, survival can still be low even with experience (1595). Conversely, primates reared only in cages have shown poor outcomes; most reintroduced golden lion tamarins did not survive over seven years, and more captive-born squirrel monkeys died or were returned to captivity compared to wild-born monkeys (1594).",

    "answer": "Evidence suggests translocation can be beneficial for primate survival. Studies found that 'problem' rhesus monkeys, olive baboons, and western lowland gorillas that were translocated survived and often remained at release sites for several years (1422). Similarly, primates including orangutans translocated from development sites to natural habitats showed high survival rates in multiple studies (1558). A study in Belize also found that a majority of black howler monkeys translocated from an abundant population area to an uninhabited site survived (1559). However, no evidence was found for the specific action of relocating primates to non-residential areas in response to conflict in existing residential areas (1423).",

    "answer": "Several community-led approaches exist. Communities can implement their own no-hunting policies or traditional hunting bans, which have been associated with increased populations of gorillas and Sclater's monkeys and reduced killing of snub-nosed monkeys (1478). Another strategy is to strengthen, support, or re-install local taboos that forbid killing primates; this was linked to higher densities of Laotian black crested gibbons where such a taboo existed (1479). Additionally, communities can take direct control of anti-poaching activities, which one study found to be more effective at reducing illegal hunting than management in a nearby national park (1482).",

Feeding only during resource-scarce periods was linked to high survival in reintroduced chimpanzees and baboons (1527). Providing artificial water sources was part of interventions where a minority of reintroduced primates survived (1531). Providing artificial nesting sites showed negative impacts for lion tamarins, which experienced population declines, but positive impacts for juvenile gorillas, which had high survival rates when nesting platforms were provided (1530).",

Using noise deterrents and chasing primates was found to reduce crop raiding by orangutans and cause gorillas to return to protected forests (1449). In Indonesia, using nets to protect individual crop trees also reduced crop-raiding by orangutans (1442). No direct evidence was found for the effectiveness of several other non-lethal methods, including using natural thorny hedges (1437), planting unpalatable buffer crops (1438), strategically deploying predator scents (1448), or chasing primates with dogs (1444).",

Similarly, treating sick or injured animals was associated with high survival in studies on chimpanzees and gorillas but high mortality in studies on golden lion tamarins and lar gibbons (1550). Treating for internal or external parasites was linked to high survival for chimpanzees and gorillas but high mortality for mandrills and pygmy slow lorises (1551).
