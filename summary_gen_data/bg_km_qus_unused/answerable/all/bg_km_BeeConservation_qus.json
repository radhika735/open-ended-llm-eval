    "question": "What are the most effective ways to manage uncropped field margins on European farmland to support bumblebees?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that sowing uncropped field margins is more effective than leaving them to naturally regenerate. Sowing margins with a native wild flower seed mix was shown in five UK trials to support a higher abundance and often species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped or grassy margins (19). Similarly, four trials showed that margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes (e.g., perennial legumes) attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins (18). In contrast, evidence for uncropped grassy margins is mixed (14), and the value of naturally regenerated margins can be inconsistent and reliant on weed species (20).",

Twenty-nine of thirty trials showed successful occupation of nest boxes by solitary bees, with some studies showing local populations can double over three years with their provision (47). In contrast, bumblebee nest boxes show highly variable success. While some older studies showed occupancy rates of 10-48%, three recent UK trials of common surface nest box designs found very low uptake rates of 0-2.5% (48).",

However, the value of these sown margins can degrade and may require re-sowing every few years (18). Sowing with native wild flowers has also been shown to support a higher abundance and richness of foraging bumblebees compared to naturally regenerated margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important for long-tongued species (19). In contrast, while naturally regenerated margins can support more bumblebees than cropped areas, their value for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may depend on the presence of weed species like thistles (20).",

Challenges in captivity include the importance of pollen diet, as fresh pollen led to better queen survival and larger colonies than dried pollen (50). When reintroduced to the wild, the success of laboratory-reared colonies is variable. Of four trials that monitored colonies until new queens were produced, two found very low or zero queen production, while two had good numbers (52). A significant challenge upon release is parasitism by cuckoo bees, with rates reported as high as 79% in one UK trial (52).

Increasing the use of clover leys is another possibility, though no evidence was found that this enhances wild bee populations, and one trial showed it did not attract solitary bees for nesting (16).

One study in Italy showed that avoiding repeated applications of the insecticide fenitrothion prevented a reduction in the number of solitary bee species [26]. Conversely, a trial in the USA found that the responsible use of pesticides on squash farms did not affect the numbers of foraging bees [27]. In England, creating conservation headlands (unsprayed margins within the crop) did not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventionally sprayed crop fields [29].",

In the same state, another trial found that introduced bee species sometimes occupied nest boxes more commonly than native bees [47]. On a positive note, a trial on blueberry fields found that providing nest boxes increased the estimated number of foraging Osmia bees over three years compared to fields without boxes [47].",

Proximity to floral resources is critical; one study estimated that nest boxes must be within 150 to 600 metres of forage (47). Nest box design also affects productivity, with one trial showing that reed stem and wooden grooved-board boxes produced more bees than plastic-lined or paper tube designs, which were susceptible to mould and parasitism (47). However, another trial found cardboard straws were more productive than grooved boards for a specific bee species (47). High rates of parasitism and predation are a major factor, with overall mortality rates ranging from 13% to 56% in some studies. Finally, competition from introduced species, such as European earwigs and non-native bees, can reduce use by native bees (47).",

For bumblebees, increasing areas of rough grassland, such as through grassy field margins, can attract nest-searching queens (12).

    "question": "What factors, such as diet and social parasitism, have been shown to affect the success of captive-rearing and reintroducing bumblebee colonies?",
    "answer": "Several factors influence success. For captive rearing, the pollen diet is important; one trial showed that buff-tailed bumblebees fed freshly frozen pollen produced larger, more successful queens than those fed dried pollen, and other trials showed pollen with higher protein content led to more offspring (50). Upon reintroduction to the wild, social parasitism by cuckoo bees can be a major issue, with rates as high as 79% in one UK trial. This trial suggested parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate resource availability later in the season (52).",

    "question": "How do the impacts of planting floral resources for bees differ when implemented at a local patch scale versus a wider landscape scale?",
    "answer": "The evidence on scaling is mixed. At a local scale, fourteen trials have recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants (17). However, one trial showed that local flower patches did not increase bee numbers or species richness in surrounding farmland 50-1,500 m away (17). In contrast, a large-scale trial showed that the abundance of long-tongued bumblebees was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square, suggesting a landscape-scale benefit (21).",
