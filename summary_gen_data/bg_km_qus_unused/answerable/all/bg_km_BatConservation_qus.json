    "answer": "There is limited but emerging evidence for treating bats directly, but no evidence for the effectiveness of most other preventative strategies. Two studies found that treating infected little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival in lab or field settings, although results on disease severity were mixed (2008). In contrast, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), restricting human access to caves to reduce spread (1010), decontaminating equipment (2006), treating hibernacula environments (2007), or using captive breeding to supplement affected populations (2009).",

    "answer": "A variety of crossing structures can be installed, with varying effectiveness. Underpasses and culverts are used by bats, though often a proportion of bats still cross over the road at traffic height (976). Overpasses are also used, but again, studies found many bats crossed elsewhere or below traffic height (977). One study found a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979). In contrast, bat gantries were found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with most bats crossing below them at a dangerous height (978). Additionally, maintaining existing roosts within road bridges (1966) or creating new roosting spaces (1967) can support bat populations affected by such infrastructure.",

    "answer": "There is a trade-off between benefits and harms for restricting access. Installing gates at cave (999) or mine (1963) entrances can lead to fewer bats, fewer species, and altered flight behaviour. However, some studies found bat populations increased or stabilized after gates were installed (999). Regarding fences, one study in Spain found no difference in population growth or occupancy rates for bats in caves with or without fencing or gates (1991). In contrast, a study in the USA found that significantly more bats emerged from a cave after a gate was replaced with a fence, suggesting fences may be less disruptive in some contexts (1991).",

Similarly, agroforestry systems with shade trees are 'likely to be beneficial', supporting more bats and higher diversity than unshaded monocultures (963). In contrast, agri-environment schemes in the UK were found to be 'unlikely to be beneficial', with studies showing no difference or even lower bat activity compared to conventional farms (962).

Increasing the wind speed at which turbines become operational ('cut-in speed') was found to be 'beneficial', with ten of twelve studies showing it resulted in fewer bat fatalities (1960). Similarly, preventing turbine blades from turning at low wind speeds ('feathering') is also 'beneficial', with five of six studies finding it reduced fatalities (970). Slowing the rotation of blades at low wind speeds was also found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in one study (2939).

This includes bat boxes, with 41 of 43 studies finding they were used (1024), and artificial caves or hibernacula, which were used in all four studies found (2049). However, there are significant drawbacks. Occupancy rates can be low; 22 studies found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (1024). When used to replace destroyed roosts during developments, bats may not use the new structures at all, or may use them in lower numbers, with new roosts being four times less likely to be used than retained ones (949). Furthermore, certain designs or features, such as heated bat boxes, may not be used by target species like maternity colonies (2052).",

To prevent fruit bats from damaging orchards, non-lethal measures such as organic deterrent sprays, hanging plastic flags, and netting tree branches were found to be 'likely to be beneficial' in reducing fruit damage (1953). For managing rabies risk from vampire bats, alternatives like vaccinating livestock or humans have been suggested, but no studies were found that evaluated the effects of replacing culling with these methods on vampire bat populations (1950, 1979). Broader strategies include public education campaigns to dispel myths and improve perceptions of bats, which studies have found can result in more positive attitudes (1000).",

Positional factors linked to success include orientation relative to sunlight, height, and location (e.g., on buildings vs. trees), with higher occupancy rates in areas with known pre-existing roosts and where more boxes are installed (1024). Managing the microclimate can also be crucial; modifying artificial roosts to reduce internal temperatures increased the number of bats using them (2052).

    "answer": "Several actions have been considered to combat white-nose syndrome, though evidence for their effect on bat populations is limited. Treating bats infected with the fungus is rated as having 'Unknown effectiveness', but two studies found that using a probiotic bacterium increased the survival of little brown bats (2008). For all other listed actions, no evidence was found regarding their effects on bat populations. These include restricting human access to caves (1010), decontaminating clothing and equipment (2006), treating the hibernacula environments (2007), vaccinating bats (1011), culling infected bats (1012), and breeding bats in captivity to supplement affected populations (2009).",

    "answer": "Based on the evidence, actions involving water sources appear most beneficial. Creating artificial water sources is 'Likely to be beneficial', with five studies finding bat activity was similar or higher over artificial water bodies compared to natural wetlands or other nearby habitats (959). Restoring wetlands is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with one study finding it increased overall bat activity (2036). Other actions have less certain outcomes. Restoring foraging habitat at ex-quarry sites (2286), in urban areas (954), and restoring forests (2050) are all rated 'Unknown effectiveness', although individual studies reported increased bat activity in some restored sites compared to unrestored ones.",

    "answer": "The outcomes of education and engagement initiatives vary. Engaging farmers and landowners to manage land for bats resulted in 77 management agreements and an increase in the greater horseshoe bat population at four roosts (1936). In Ghana, educating local communities on the negative impacts of bat hunting (1973) and the associated disease risks (1974) led to fewer hunters intending to hunt bats. However, for other educational actions, no studies were found that evaluated their effects on bat populations. This includes educating the public to improve perceptions of bats (1000), educating homeowners about planning laws (1931), and educating farmers about the benefits of bats (2040).",

Agroforestry is also rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (963). In contrast, there are significant evidence gaps for other mitigation actions, with no studies found that evaluated the effects of changing effluent treatments in agriculture (1016), using organic pest control specifically (2014), preventing pollution from entering watercourses (2015), or planting riparian buffer strips to reduce pollution (2016).",

    "question": "What design and placement factors influence the successful use of bat boxes by bats?",
    "answer": "Evidence from numerous studies suggests both design and placement are critical for bat box uptake (1024). Key design factors associated with higher use include using black-coloured boxes, larger box sizes, concrete rather than wood construction, and multiple internal compartments. Key placement factors include orientation and sun exposure, height, location (with boxes on buildings being used more than on trees), and the surrounding habitat type. Occupancy rates were also found to be higher when a greater number of boxes were installed across a site (1024). Additionally, managing the microclimate of artificial roosts, for example by modifying them to reduce internal temperatures, was found in one study to increase the number of bats using them (2052).",

Two studies on overpasses found that some bat species used them, but up to three-quarters of bats still crossed at traffic height or elsewhere (977).

For agroforestry, studies found more bat species and higher diversity in shaded plantations compared to those with no shade or a single shade species. Two studies also found more bats or higher activity of forest bat species in plantations with varied shade cover, and one study found bats had better body condition in a silvopastoral system that used agroforestry (963).

One study found 70-90% of hand-reared pipistrelles survived 4-14 days post-release, with some joining wild colonies. Another study found 13% of ringed, hand-reared bats were found alive in bat boxes up to four years later (2054).
