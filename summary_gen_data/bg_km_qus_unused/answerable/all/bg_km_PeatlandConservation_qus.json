These include filling or blocking ditches, which has been shown to be colonized by herbs and bryophytes within 2-3 years in some studies and is rated 'Likely to be beneficial' (1805). Removing the upper layer of peat or soil is also 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies in fens showing it can increase cover of characteristic plants and overall species richness (1809).

    "answer": "Using grazing to maintain disturbance in fens has shown mixed results: it increased cover of some herbs but reduced purple moor grass and Sphagnum moss, with inconsistent effects on shrub cover and species richness (1762). In contrast, prescribed fire also had varied effects on herbs but consistently reduced tree and shrub cover. Fire was found to increase plant species richness in two of three studies, whereas grazing had mixed effects on richness or resulted in fewer species than mowing (1763).",

    "answer": "A range of non-habitat interventions are documented. Legal protection of peatland sites has been shown to slow habitat loss (1796). Financial incentives, such as paying landowners, have had mixed success in protecting bog habitat area (1799). Increasing 'on-the-ground' protection like ranger patrols can reduce illegal activities such as logging (1800). Public awareness campaigns have been shown to influence consumer behaviour, such as purchasing peat-free compost (1844), and lobbying has led to increased protected areas (1849). Finally, providing education and training to local people can increase adoption of sustainable farming practices (1848).",

    "answer": "For restoring open fens, physically removing problematic moss carpets has been shown to increase the cover of fen-characteristic plants and overall species richness, but studies report mixed effects on herb cover (1768). Cutting problematic large trees and shrubs can also increase fen-characteristic plants, overall vegetation cover, and species richness. However, one study found that this intervention could not prevent long-term increases in shrub cover (1772).",

Removing the upper layer of peat or soil is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', as studies found it increased cover of characteristic wetland plants (1809). Disturbing the peat surface, for example by tilling, has 'Unknown effectiveness' but was found to encourage colonization by desirable fen species (1811). Covering the peat surface with organic mulch (1813) or other materials like fleece or plastic mesh (1814) also has 'Unknown effectiveness', with studies showing mixed results from no effect to increased vegetation cover.",

    "question": "For fen restoration, what are the typical timeframes for vegetation to respond to ditch blocking versus topsoil removal?",
    "answer": "The timeframes for vegetation response differ significantly between these two actions in fens. Blocked or filled ditches can be colonized relatively quickly, with studies showing colonization by herbs and bryophytes within 2–3 years (1805). In contrast, removing the top layer of soil leads to longer-term changes. Studies report increased cover of fen-characteristic plants after 4–13 years and increased species richness over a period of 2–18 years, though overall vegetation biomass may remain reduced for up to 18 years (1809).",
