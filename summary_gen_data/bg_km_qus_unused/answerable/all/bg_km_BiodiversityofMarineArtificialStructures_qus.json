Maintenance activities can also reverse benefits, as created or naturally formed holes and pits are often filled or repaired (3434, 3475).

    "question": "What does the evidence from Singaporean waters suggest about the effectiveness of creating small-scale topographical features on intertidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Evidence from Singapore suggests that creating small-scale topographical features generally increases biodiversity, though effects on abundance can be variable. Creating small protrusions (1-50 mm), along with other features like grooves, ridges, and pits, was found to increase the combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (3462, 3474). However, the effects on overall community composition and abundance were mixed, often depending on the specific site, shore level, and the size and arrangement of the features created (3474, 3475). For example, creating small protrusions alone did not alter community composition in one study (3462), while creating pits was found to do so (3475).",

    "answer": "The evidence is limited and currently restricted to subtidal structures, as no studies were found for intertidal structures (3440). For subtidal structures, reducing the frequency of cleaning did not significantly alter the overall invertebrate and fish community, richness, or abundance in one study, but it did lead to an increase in macroalgal abundance. Another study found that reducing the area of a structure that was cleaned resulted in an increased abundance of seahorses (3447).",

    "question": "How do the biodiversity outcomes of creating small pits (1-50 mm) compare to larger holes (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures?",
    "answer": "Direct comparison is difficult as both interventions were often studied alongside other habitat enhancements. However, both appear to have beneficial effects. Creating larger holes (>50 mm) was found in three studies to alter community composition, and in two of those studies, it increased species richness or diversity (3434). Creating smaller pits (1-50 mm) was found in one study (in combination with holes and other features) to alter community composition and increase species diversity (3455). For both interventions, effects on the abundance of organisms were mixed (3434, 3455).",

    "answer": "Several interventions show potential for enhancing fish communities. Creating large adjoining cavities or 'swimthrough' habitats (>100 mm) was found to support fish species absent from other surfaces and increased overall fish species richness and abundance (3456). Managing or restricting harvesting on structures also showed benefits, leading to different fish community compositions, higher species richness, and supporting species absent from unrestricted structures, although abundance effects were mixed (3457). Creating smaller features like small swimthroughs (≤100 mm) or holes (>50 mm) had more variable outcomes, with studies reporting mixed or neutral effects on juvenile fish communities and fish abundance (3436, 3434).",

    "answer": "The evidence base for large-scale topographical modifications is very limited. For creating 'natural rocky reef topography', one intertidal study found it did not increase species richness (3435), and one subtidal study found it did not increase the abundance of settling canopy macroalgae (3446). Evidence for reducing the slope of structures is similarly sparse. For intertidal structures, one study reported an increase in overall species richness when slope reduction was combined with creating rock pools, but another study found it did not increase macroalgal or invertebrate abundance (3461). No studies were found that evaluated reducing the slope of subtidal structures (3442).",

    "answer": "Creating water-retaining features has shown the most consistent positive effects on species richness. Nine of twelve studies on creating 'rock pools' found they supported higher species richness or diversity than adjacent emergent surfaces (3476). Similarly, three studies found that creating hole habitats (>50 mm), often in combination with rock pools or other features, increased combined macroalgae and invertebrate species richness (3467). In contrast, some other interventions were less effective; studies on creating natural rocky reef topography (3435) or large protrusions (>50 mm) (3463) found they did not increase overall species richness.",

    "question": "What biological factors have been shown to influence the survival of organisms transplanted onto artificial marine structures?",
    "answer": "Biological factors play a critical role in the success of transplanting efforts. For subtidal structures, predation appears to be a major cause of failure, with several studies on canopy algae finding that survival was much higher or only occurred when transplants were protected by cages (3471). For intertidal structures, the species being transplanted is a key factor, as studies have shown that survival rates of invertebrates like limpets, corals, sponges, and oysters varied significantly between different species (3472). The suitability of the tidal height is also important; one study found transplanted macroalgae survived better at mid- and high-shore levels compared to lowshore (3472).",
