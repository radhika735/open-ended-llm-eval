    "question": "What actions can be taken to increase plant species richness when restoring grassland habitats?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests several actions can increase plant species richness. Sowing seeds of parasitic plants like yellow rattle has been found to increase plant species richness and/or diversity in five of six studies (3404). Site preparation is also key; one study found that removing topsoil before sowing seeds increased plant species richness (3415). Additionally, the simple act of sowing native grass and forb seeds was found to increase overall plant species richness in sixteen of twenty-eight studies (3432).",

    "answer": "Both methods of site preparation can benefit grassland restoration, but evidence suggests removing topsoil may have more comprehensive positive effects. Disturbing soil before sowing was found to increase plant and seedling species richness in one of two studies and increase forb cover in another study (3413). In contrast, removing topsoil before seeding was found to increase plant species richness, the species richness of sown plants, and the plant community's similarity to intact steppe. It also increased the survival of seedlings and plants in two studies (3415).",

    "answer": "Evidence shows mixed results when comparing mechanical seeding techniques. In the USA, one study found sowing with a seed drill increased the density of two sown grass species compared to hand sowing, but two other studies found it led to no change or a reduction in plant abundance compared to hydroseeding or hand sowing (3410). One US study found hydroseeding increased the abundance of half of the sown species compared to drill seeding (3412). In the UK, slot/strip seeding was found to increase grass and forb richness in one study, but a review found it often resulted in failed introductions of sown species (3411).",

    "answer": "Several mechanical site preparation techniques have been studied. Disturbing soil by ploughing or tilling before sowing was found to increase plant emergence in four of five studies and increase forb cover in another (3413). Removing topsoil or turf entirely before seeding was found in multiple studies to increase sown species richness, grass and forb richness, and the survival of seedlings (3415).

    "question": "What does the evidence from different continents suggest about how sowing different seed types—such as just grasses versus mixed grass and forbs—affects forb abundance?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that the composition of the seed mix is critical for forb abundance. In North American studies, sowing only grass seeds was found to reduce the abundance of native forbs or have no effect (3397). In contrast, sowing a mix of native grass and forb seeds increased forb cover or density in studies in both the USA and the Czech Republic (3432). Also in the USA, sowing seeds at a higher density increased forb cover (3405). In a European study in Switzerland, the specialist action of sowing parasitic plants did not alter the cover of forbs (3404).",

    "question": "What are the effects of post-seeding management, specifically mowing versus grazing, on grassland vegetation in the UK?",
    "answer": "Studies in the UK show varied effects of mowing and grazing after seeding. One study directly comparing the two found that annual cutting increased plant species richness compared to livestock grazing (3419, 3423). Mowing after sowing was also found to increase sown species richness and the abundance of sown forbs in other UK studies (3419). The effects of grazing were more complex; one study found grazing with cattle increased sown species richness compared to sheep, but another found cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to sheep (3423). A separate study found winter grazing increased seedling survival (3423).",
