    "question": "What management actions are available to control problematic tree species in shrubland habitats?",
    "answer": "Several actions to control problematic tree species have been studied, though their effectiveness is often uncertain. Methods include applying herbicide to trees (1629), cutting trees (1630), and using grazing by livestock (1634). More intensive approaches involve cutting trees and then removing leaf litter (1631), removing seedlings (1632), applying herbicide (1636), or using prescribed burning (1637). Prescribed burning can be used on its own (1721) or in combination with increased livestock numbers (1722). Most of these interventions are rated as having 'Unknown effectiveness', with studies showing mixed results on shrub cover and plant diversity.",

A combination of cutting and applying herbicide also yielded mixed results, increasing heather cover in one study but having no effect in another (1654).

In European heathlands, using prescribed burning to control purple moor grass was found to reduce the cover of common heather without affecting the grass itself (1723). Reinstating traditional burning showed an initial decrease in plant cover, which later increased (1625). As an alternative, cutting or mowing to mimic grazing had mixed effects on heather cover in studies from Spain and Italy, but it tended to increase grass cover (1627).

    "question": "As an alternative to physical buffers, what active management techniques can be used to reduce the impacts of pollutants in shrublands?",
    "answer": "Two active management techniques considered as alternatives to physical buffers are mowing and burning. Both have 'Unknown effectiveness'. A UK study found that mowing to reduce nitrogen deposition impacts did not alter the shoot length of common heather or the number of purple moor grass seedlings (1669). Similarly, a UK study on prescribed burning for the same purpose found it also did not alter the shoot length of common heather or the number of purple moor grass seedlings when compared to mowing (1670).",

Studies have found it increased the cover or abundance of heathland plant species, woody plants, and forbs, as well as overall plant cover and species number (1686). The addition of manure has 'Unknown effectiveness', but one study in South Africa found that it increased plant cover and the number of plant species (1695).",

However, some positive outcomes were reported. Using erosion control blankets was found to increase the height of two shrub species in one study and plant diversity in another (1692).

    "question": "For shrubland conservation, how does the effectiveness of cutting bracken compare with using herbicide to control it?",
    "answer": "Evidence shows mixed results for both methods. Some studies found that cutting bracken increased heather cover or biomass, while others found no effect (1653). Similarly, applying herbicide increased heather seedlings or biomass in some trials but not in others (1652). Both methods have shown some success in reducing bracken cover or biomass, but results are not consistent (1652, 1653). One study found that cutting increased heathland plant species richness, while another study on herbicides found an increase in the number of plant species (1652, 1653). Combining the two methods also produced mixed results for heather, though it consistently reduced bracken cover in three studies (1654).",

    "answer": "Several management options exist after tree removal. Simply cutting trees was found in one UK study to increase heather seedling density but not mature plants, while a South African study found it increased herbaceous cover but not native woody plants (1630). A more intensive approach of cutting trees and removing the litter layer was found to increase the cover of two heather species in one trial (1631). Another strategy, cutting trees and removing seedlings, was shown to increase plant diversity and shrub cover in a controlled study (1632). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of simply removing trees/crops to restore shrubland structure or removing trees along with leaf litter and topsoil (1683, 1684).",

Likewise, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of creating buffer zones (1618) or planting vegetation to act as a pollution buffer (1665) beside transportation corridors in shrublands.

    "answer": "Cutting, mowing, and prescribed burning are documented alternatives to livestock grazing for managing shrubland succession. Using cutting or mowing to mimic grazing has shown mixed effects on heather cover, with some studies showing an increase and others a decrease (1627). It has been found to increase grass cover and, in one case, reduce tree cover (1627). Prescribed burning is another alternative. Reinstating traditional burning practices was found to initially decrease plant cover before a subsequent increase, with a review noting no change in species diversity (1625). Using prescribed burning specifically to control trees was found in one study to reduce heather cover while having mixed effects on tree basal area (1721).",

Both actions are rated 'Likely to be beneficial'. Adding topsoil has been shown to increase the cover and abundance of heathland or woody plants, as well as plant diversity (1686). Sowing seeds was found to increase shrub cover or abundance in five of six studies reviewed (1698). Other methods, such as planting turf (1703), spreading clippings (1701), and planting individual plants (1697), are rated as having 'Unknown effectiveness' due to more limited or mixed evidence.",

Stripping topsoil completely has produced varied results for heather cover, with one study finding an increase and two others finding no effect (1685). However, it has been shown to increase the number of heathland plant species (1647) and the cover of both specialist and generalist plants in some cases (1685). In one instance, it increased annual grasses while decreasing perennial grasses (1685). Simple soil disturbance (without removal) also has inconsistent outcomes, with one study showing an increase in plant abundance and richness, and another showing no change (1728). When combined with the addition of seeds or clippings, topsoil stripping has been shown to increase heathland plant cover (1711).",

Similarly, using fences to exclude livestock is 'Likely to be beneficial', with multiple studies finding increased shrub cover, abundance, or biomass, although some studies found no change or even a decrease (1545). For large wild herbivores, reducing their numbers led to increased shrub or heather cover in two studies (1663). Fencing to exclude deer was found to increase shrub height but not cover in one study (1662). Effects on other vegetation like grasses were mixed across all interventions (1545, 1607, 1663).",
