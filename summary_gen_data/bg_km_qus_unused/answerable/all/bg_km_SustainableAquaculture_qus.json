    "question": "What non-chemical methods are available to control sea lice on Atlantic salmon farms?",
    "answer": "Based on the evidence, non-chemical methods to control sea lice include using certain species of cleaner wrasse, though studies in Ireland show their effectiveness is mixed (738). The number of lice can also be reduced by feeding salmon a diet with plant-based protein and beta-glucans, which reduced lice infection by 28% and a further 28% respectively in a Norwegian study (732). Another study in Norway found that keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulted in lower numbers of lice (741).",

A study found that feeding salmon a diet with fish meal and 28% plant-based protein reduced lice numbers by 28%, with a further 28% reduction when beta-glucans were added (732). Breeding for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis increased survival levels when exposed to the disease (735). Salmon that had undergone aerobic training also had higher survival rates when exposed to the same disease (740). Finally, keeping salmon in low intensity artificial light led to lower numbers of lice (741).",

However, there are several potential drawbacks related to fish performance. Multiple studies in Norway, Scotland, and the USA found that plant-based protein diets led to decreased growth rates, reduced final body weights, and lower feed digestibility. Some studies also noted that the morphology of the salmon's distal intestine was altered by these diets (924).
