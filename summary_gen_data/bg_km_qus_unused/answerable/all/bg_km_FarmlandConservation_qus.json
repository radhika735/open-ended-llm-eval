    "answer": "The evidence suggests creating and managing linear features is beneficial. Managing existing hedgerows for wildlife, such as by reducing cutting frequency, has been found to increase berry yields and the diversity of plants, invertebrates, and birds (116). Similarly, studies on planting new hedges show they can support higher numbers of beetles and spiders and greater plant diversity compared to crop fields or grass margins (538). Creating beetle banks has also been found to benefit some invertebrates by providing habitat, and they may also be used by birds and small mammals, although effects can vary between species and seasons (651).",

    "answer": "The impacts of reducing grazing are varied and context-dependent. Excluding livestock entirely from some semi-natural habitats has been found to benefit plants and invertebrates (150). On upland heath and moorland, reducing grazing can increase heather cover and the abundance of some plants and arthropods (647). Conversely, some studies found negative impacts, with reduced grazing intensity leading to a decrease in the abundance of soil organisms (647). One systematic review concluded that intermediate grazing levels are often optimal for plants, invertebrates, and birds on meadow pasture, highlighting that benefits for one group may require trade-offs for another (704). Another study found that northern lapwing nest survival was greater on ungrazed marshes compared to grazed ones (697).",

For wet meadow restoration, some studies found positive effects on plant communities within five years of implementing techniques like topsoil removal or introducing target species (119). Similarly, when restoring species-rich grasslands, studies have documented positive signs in less than five years, with more substantial changes often occurring within a decade (133). However, the evidence also indicates that restoration can be a very slow process, with some studies finding that restored grasslands still differ from ancient species-rich sites even after 20 to 60 years (119, 133).",

Planting a dedicated wild bird seed or cover mixture is also highly effective, with evidence showing these plots have a higher abundance and diversity of birds than other habitats; mixtures including kale are particularly beneficial (594). Creating conservation headlands, where spraying of herbicides and fertilizers is restricted on the outer strip of a cereal crop, increases the abundance of weed seeds for birds to eat (652). For farms with silage fields, leaving uncut strips of rye grass can also provide a valuable seed resource over winter (132).",

Delaying the date of first mowing has been found to benefit plants by increasing species richness, as well as invertebrates and birds such as the Eurasian skylark, which can see increased productivity (131). Raising the mowing height on grasslands can also benefit Eurasian skylarks by increasing their productivity and has been found to be less damaging to amphibians and invertebrates (138). Finally, the mowing technique itself is important; studies show that mowing from the centre of the field outwards can reduce chick mortality by allowing them to escape, and using bar mowers causes less harm to amphibians and invertebrates than rotary disc mowers (698).",
