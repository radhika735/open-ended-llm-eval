    "question": "For agricultural land in the UK, what actions have been shown to reduce nutrient loss from the soil?",
    "answer": "Several actions in the UK have been shown to reduce nutrient loss. Delaying manure application from autumn to December or January was found to reduce nitrate loss (893). Applying nitrification inhibitors was found in three UK and New Zealand trials to reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions (909). Incorporating straw was also found to reduce nitrate leaching (910), and applying farmyard manure in winter rather than autumn also reduced nutrient loss (911).",

    "question": "What is the evidence for the effects of amending soil with different types of compost on soil structure and nutrient levels?",
    "answer": "Applying high rates of cotton gin compost and poultry manure improved soil structure but increased nutrient loss in one trial (891). A trial using municipal compost found it greatly reduced soil loss and water runoff (890). Adding municipal compost as mulch improved soil structure (887). One trial found that applying a high rate of unspecified compost increased soil organic matter levels (889), and another found mycorrhizal-inoculated compost increased soil organic matter (888). Applying manure and compost also had a positive effect on soil physical properties (911).",

Adding mulches (887), applying municipal compost (890), and controlling farm traffic (899) have all been found to reduce water runoff.",

    "question": "In China and India, what factors have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of soil amendments for improving soil health and yield?",
    "answer": "Studies in China and India suggest that combining amendments can improve their effectiveness. Using a mix of manure and inorganic fertilizers was found to increase soil organic carbon and maize yields more than either alone (902). In China, retaining crop residues was only found to increase soil organic carbon and yield when fertilizer was also applied (907). Similarly, studies in China and India found higher carbon levels when plant material like straw was incorporated along with NPK fertilizers (910).",
