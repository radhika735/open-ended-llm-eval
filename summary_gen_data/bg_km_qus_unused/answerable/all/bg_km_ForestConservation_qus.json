    "answer": "Studies have found that fencing to exclude grazing is likely to be beneficial, with four of five studies showing increased survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). In contrast, the effectiveness of tree guards or shelters is unknown. One study found that light-coloured plastic shelters increased survival, while another found that guards increased tree height at 37 months but not 44 months (1268).",

Excluding livestock with wire fences was generally beneficial, increasing understory biomass and tree regeneration in studies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Israel, Mexico, Kenya, and the USA (1205). Completely preventing livestock grazing increased understory plant diversity in Brazil, the UK, and Costa Rica, and increased oak seedling density in Israel (1206). Shortening the grazing period had mixed results: it increased regenerating oak abundance in Spain, but had no effect on native plant richness in Australia. A UK study found summer grazing was better for tree seedling numbers than winter grazing (1208).",

    "answer": "The evidence base for these methods is mixed and often sparse. For many actions, such as planting a mixture of tree species to enhance survival (1159), infecting seedlings with mycorrhizae (1160), using pioneer plants as nurse plants (1163), or using transplants and nursery plugs (1203), no evidence was found. However, there is some evidence for other methods. One study found that sowing tree seeds increased the density and species richness of new trees (1244). Another found building bird-perches for seed dispersal increased species richness and abundance of new seedlings (1245). Studies on planting a mixture of species to enhance diversity (1243) and adding organic matter or leaf litter (1250, 1161) found mixed or positive results, such as increased species richness.",

Fencing to prevent grazing is likely to be beneficial, with studies showing it increased survival, size, and cover (1254). Shading was found in one study to increase the survival of native seedlings (1269). Using tree guards or shelters had mixed results; one study found light-coloured shelters increased survival while another noted a temporary increase in height (1268). Interventions to control competing vegetation are also available. Mechanical removal of understory plants was largely ineffective (1256), as was the use of weed mats in one study (1267). Using herbicides was also rated unlikely to be beneficial, though some studies showed an increase in tree size (1262).

    "question": "How do mechanical removal and herbicide application compare in their effectiveness for controlling understory vegetation after tree planting?",
    "answer": "Both methods have mixed or limited evidence of benefit. For mechanical removal, five studies found no effect on seedling emergence, survival, or growth, though one study found it increased seedling biomass (1256). For herbicide application, two of three studies found it increased the size of planted trees, while one found no effect on size and another found no effect on frost damage (1262).",

    "question": "What are the documented negative impacts of timber harvesting activities, such as thinning or logging, on non-vascular plants in forests?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that timber harvesting can be harmful to non-vascular plants. Three of four studies on thinning found it decreased the abundance and species richness of epiphytic plants (1212). Two of three studies on logging found it decreased epiphytic plant abundance and fern fertility (1270). Additionally, one study found that logging after a wildfire decreased the species richness and diversity of mosses (1234).",

    "question": "What management actions are available to aid forest recovery after a wildfire, and what is known about their effectiveness?",
    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Thinning trees after a wildfire showed mixed results: two studies in Spain found it increased plant species richness, while one study in the USA found it decreased plant biomass (1234). Sowing tree seeds was found to be likely ineffective or harmful, with studies showing it decreased native species numbers and tree seedling density (1236). Removing burned trees was found to increase total plant species richness in two studies (1237). No evidence was found for the effects of planting trees after a wildfire (1235).",

    "question": "How does the effectiveness of community-based forest management vary across different countries according to the available evidence?",
    "answer": "The effectiveness of community-based forest management appears to vary geographically. In studies from Ethiopia and Nepal, forest cover increased more in community-managed forests than in other forests (1152). In contrast, a study in Colombia found that deforestation rates in community-managed forests were not different from rates in forests not under community management or in uninhabited national parks (1152).",

    "answer": "The effects of these interventions are varied. Adding organic matter like leaf litter or wood-chips was found to increase seedling biomass but decrease emergence and survival (1258). Adding lime decreased the survival of pine seedlings in one study, while another found no effect on oak seedling growth (1259). A study covering the ground with straw found it increased the growth rate of planted trees and shrubs (1266). Using general soil enhancers, including fertilizer, showed mixed effects on seedling survival and height (1153, 1260).",

One study in Hong Kong found that tree guards increased tree height after 37 months, but this effect was no longer present at 44 months (1268). A separate study in the USA found that light-coloured plastic tree shelters did increase the survival rate of planted seedlings (1268).",
