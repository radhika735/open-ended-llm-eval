    "answer": "Several actions show potential for protecting seedlings. Applying insecticide was found in one US study to increase seedling emergence and survival (1149). Fencing to exclude grazing animals is rated as 'Likely to be beneficial', with four of five studies finding it increased the survival, size, and cover of planted trees (1254). Watering seedlings increased survival during a dry summer in one study in Spain (1154). Using plastic tree shelters also increased survival rates in a US study (1268). Conversely, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of applying fungicides to protect seedlings (1156).",

    "answer": "Both selective logging and thinning can be beneficial for understory plants. Five of ten studies found logging increased the density and cover of understory plants (1273), while seventeen of 25 studies found that thinning did the same (1211). For young trees, the evidence differs. Thinning was found to increase the density of young trees in six of twelve studies (1210). In contrast, the evidence for logging is more limited and mixed, with one study finding it increased young tree density and another finding mixed effects (1272).",

Using wire fences to exclude large native herbivores is rated 'Likely to be beneficial', with studies showing increased understory plant cover and tree density (1230).

    "question": "To exclude large herbivores from forests, what is the comparative evidence for using wire versus electric fencing?",
    "answer": "Evidence suggests that fencing can be effective for excluding large herbivores, but direct comparisons are limited. Multiple studies found that wire fencing increased the cover and size of understory plants and the density of trees (1230). In one study, using wire fences to exclude livestock increased biomass and species richness of understory plants (1205). A single study on electric fencing found it increased tree density by excluding elephants and nyalas (1231).",

    "answer": "In the USA, several tree removal techniques affect mature trees. Thinning has been shown to decrease tree density and cover but increase tree size in multiple studies (1209). One study found thinning decreased tree species richness and diversity (1209). In contrast, clearcutting was found in some studies to decrease density and diversity of mature trees (1222). Logging was also found to decrease tree density and cover in some studies, while increasing tree size in others (1271).",

    "answer": "Soil disturbance techniques have varying effects. Ploughing and scarification increased the density of young trees in two of three studies, while one found it decreased density (1251). In contrast, enhancing soil compaction was found to decrease tree regeneration height and density in three studies (1253). Other non-ploughing disturbances of the forest floor were found to decrease understory vegetation cover (1252), which can compete with seedlings.",
