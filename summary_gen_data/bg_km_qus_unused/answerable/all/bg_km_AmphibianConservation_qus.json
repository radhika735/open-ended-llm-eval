    "answer": "Several actions have been studied. Installing culverts or tunnels, often with barrier fencing, can decrease road deaths (884, 756). Road closures during migration periods are also protective (842). Modifying gully pots can significantly reduce the number of newts that fall in (782). In contrast, using volunteers to assist amphibians across roads has been found to be unlikely to be beneficial, with populations still declining (784), and the effectiveness of warning signage is unknown (841).",

    "answer": "A meta-analysis found that partial harvesting, including shelterwood harvesting and thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (851, 852). Studies comparing specific methods found shelterwood harvesting resulted in similar or higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (851). However, other methods like leave-tree harvesting or harvesting in small groups did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to clearcutting (846, 844). Both partial harvesting and clearcutting typically decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest (844, 846, 851, 852).",

    "question": "What key factors are associated with the success or failure of amphibian colonization and breeding in newly created ponds?",
    "answer": "Evidence from multiple studies indicates several key factors influence the success of newly created ponds for amphibians. Successful colonization and breeding are affected by a pond's physical characteristics, including its age, whether it is permanent or ephemeral, and the extent of its vegetation cover (869). The presence of predatory fish is a major negative factor (869). Success is also strongly linked to the surrounding landscape, particularly the distance to existing ponds that can act as source populations for colonization (869). Additionally, biotic factors within the new pond can play a role; one study on natterjack toads found that while created ponds reduced mortality from desiccation compared to natural ponds, they had higher tadpole mortality from invertebrate predation (866).",

    "question": "What have been the observed effects of excluding livestock from ponds and streams on amphibian populations in the USA and UK?",
    "answer": "The evidence suggests that excluding livestock by fencing is 'likely to be ineffective or harmful'. Studies in the USA found that excluding livestock did not increase amphibian species numbers or overall abundance, though it did increase larval abundance for some species (746). Two US studies found that the abundance of green frogs and American toads was actually higher with grazing (746). Furthermore, one study noted that excluding livestock caused temporary pools to dry out 50 days earlier (746). Conversely, one study in the UK found that a pond restoration project that included livestock exclusion did increase pond use by breeding natterjack toads (746).",

    "question": "As an alternative to treating infected individuals, what environmental management actions can help control chytridiomycosis in the wild?",
    "answer": "Several environmental interventions have been studied, though with unknown effectiveness. One study found that adding salt to a pond kept a frog population free of chytridiomycosis for at least six months (762). Another approach is to remove the fungus from ponds directly; one study found that pond drying combined with fungicidal treatment of toads reduced infection levels but did not eradicate the disease (766). Additionally, taking preventative measures such as sterilizing equipment between sites is recommended to reduce the risk of spreading the disease, although direct evidence of its effect on amphibian populations is lacking (768).",

    "question": "What design and placement factors are associated with the successful use of road tunnels by migrating amphibians?",
    "answer": "Multiple factors influence whether amphibians will use road underpasses. Studies found that success is often dependent on the installation of barrier fencing to guide amphibians towards the tunnel entrances (884, 756). Key design elements affecting usage include tunnel diameter (wider is often better), length (long culverts may be avoided), lighting (with mixed effects), and substrate (natural substrates are preferred) (884). The presence of water can have mixed effects, and some designs, such as those with vertical entry chutes or certain metal materials, can be harmful or result in high mortality (884).",

On one hand, it resulted in the establishment of a translocated population, increased populations when combined with other management, and temporarily increased breeding (748).

Antifungal treatments like itraconazole also proved effective in multiple studies (882). Conversely, treatments rated as 'unlikely to be beneficial' include using antibacterial treatments (763) and using antifungal skin bacteria or peptides (764). Immunization against the fungus was found to be of 'unknown effectiveness' in the single study available (765).",

For Mallorcan midwife toads, releases established breeding populations at 38-100% of sites, though one study noted reduced genetic diversity in a reintroduced population (873). For other toad species, releases established populations in two of three studies, but survival of released Puerto Rican crested toads was low (875). This highlights that while release can lead to population establishment, survival and genetic health are significant concerns.",
