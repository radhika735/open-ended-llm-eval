First, modifying bat hibernacula environments has shown effectiveness, with a randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that a greater number of little brown bats infected with the white-nose syndrome fungus survived in hibernation chambers at 4\u00b0C than at 10\u00b0C, and that bats stayed in hibernation for longer in chambers at 4\u00b0C. Second, probiotic treatment as a disease management strategy has demonstrated mixed results. Two studies found that treating bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival for little brown bats when administered at the time of infection (one study in Canada using cages in a laboratory, and one in the USA with free-flying bats), but no increased survival was found for caged bats treated within a mine in the second USA study. Additionally, the Canadian study found that bats treated with a probiotic bacterium 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, not better. However, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of vaccinating bats against the white-nose syndrome pathogen, treating hibernacula environments to reduce the pathogen reservoir, or culling bats infected with white-nose syndrome, as indicated by the statement 'We found no studies' for each of these strategies.",

Action 1000 states explicitly that \u201cwe found no studies that evaluated the effects of educating the public to improve the perception of bats to improve behaviour towards bats.\u201d However, broader evidence from related conservation education initiatives provides some relevant insights. \n\nAction 1936 demonstrates that landowner engagement can be effective for bat conservation, showing that during a five-year farmer and landowner engagement project, the overall population of greater horseshoe bats at four maternity roosts increased, and the project resulted in 77 bat-related management agreements covering 6,536 ha of land.\n\nAction 274 shows that education programmes combined with other interventions can lead to population increases in other wildlife species, with five of six global studies finding increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes. Similarly, Action 1571 demonstrates that multimedia campaigns (theatre, film, print media, discussions) have successfully improved knowledge and attitudes towards primates and led to population increases in multiple studies across Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Madagascar and India.\n\nAction 162 provides an important caveat, noting that education alone may not be sufficient to change behaviour, though it can serve as a necessary catalytic factor when combined with economic incentives and law enforcement. Action 3681 provides evidence that engaging local communities in conservation activities can effectively protect species through reduced persecution and improved protection of nesting and breeding sites.",
