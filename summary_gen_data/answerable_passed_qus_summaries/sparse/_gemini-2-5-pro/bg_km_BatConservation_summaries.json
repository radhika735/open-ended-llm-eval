However, the same study found that bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms (2008). A randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic in a mine increased the survival of free-flying bats, but not of caged bats (2008). The same study found that the severity of white-nose syndrome in caged bats was similar to that of untreated bats(2008).
