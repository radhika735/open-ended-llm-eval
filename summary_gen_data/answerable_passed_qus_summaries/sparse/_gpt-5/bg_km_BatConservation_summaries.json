Two randomized, controlled studies tested a probiotic bacterium treatment: a laboratory study in Canada found that treating little brown bats at the time of infection increased survival within cages and reduced disease symptoms, whereas treating 21 days prior did not increase survival and was associated with worse symptoms (2008); a study in the USA found increased survival for free-flying bats treated within a mine but not for caged bats, and caged bats had similar disease severity to untreated bats (2008). No studies were found that evaluated the effects of culling infected bats (1012), vaccinating bats (1011), restricting human access to bat caves (1010), breeding bats in captivity to supplement wild populations (2009), treating hibernacula environments to reduce the pathogen reservoir (2007), or decontaminating clothing and equipment after entering caves (2006).",
