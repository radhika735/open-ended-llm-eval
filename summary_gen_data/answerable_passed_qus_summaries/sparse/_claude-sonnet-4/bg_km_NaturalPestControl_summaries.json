    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, altering pesticide application strategies to benefit natural enemies shows several effects. Threshold-based pesticide application (using pesticides only when pest damage reaches specified threshold levels) increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years in a Finnish study, though effects lasted for as little as three weeks (Action 750). This approach resulted in fewer pesticide applications needed and lower production costs while maintaining similar crop damage and yields compared to conventional spraying regimes in most studies (Action 750). Restricting certain pesticides showed reduced negative impacts on beneficial insects, with some fungicides causing less reduction in chick food insect abundance than others (Action 565). Reducing pesticide use generally led to increased abundance and diversity of beneficial species across multiple taxa. Studies found that farms or areas with reduced chemical inputs had higher bat activity and species diversity (Action 2013), increased wood mouse abundance (Action 2539), greater butterfly and moth species richness and abundance (Action 3897), and higher densities of some bird species (Action 454). The effects varied by species, location, and specific management practices, with some studies showing mixed results depending on the particular chemicals reduced and the timing of applications.",
