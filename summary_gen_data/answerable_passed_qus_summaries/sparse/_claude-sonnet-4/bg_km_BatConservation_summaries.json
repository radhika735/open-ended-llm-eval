For probiotic treatment, two studies evaluated treating bats with probiotic bacteria: one study in Canada found increased survival when treatment occurred at the time of infection but not when given 21 days prior, while a study in the USA found increased survival for free-flying bats but not caged bats within a mine (Action 2008). However, probiotic treatment showed variable effects on disease symptoms, with reduced symptoms when applied at infection time but worse symptoms when applied 21 days prior in the Canadian study (Action 2008). No studies were found evaluating the effectiveness of culling infected bats (Action 1012), vaccinating bats against the pathogen (Action 1011), or restricting human access to caves to reduce pathogen spread (Action 1010). While cave management strategies exist, such as installing cave gates and imposing restrictions on cave visits, these have been studied for general bat conservation but not specifically for white-nose syndrome prevention (Actions 999, 1002).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several types of crossing structures can be installed to help bats cross roads and railways safely:\n\nGreen bridges are effective crossing structures, with one UK study finding that a green bridge was used by 97% of bats crossing a road (979).\n\nUnderpasses and culverts are widely used crossing structures, with eight studies across Germany, Ireland, the UK, Australia and France finding that bats used underpasses and culverts below roads in varying proportions (976). Research in Australia found that bat species adapted to cluttered habitats used small culverts and underpasses more than bat species adapted to open or edge habitats (976). A French study found that the use of underpasses by five bat species was influenced by underpass type and height, road width, and the amount of forest and hedgerows in the surrounding landscape (976).\n\nOverpasses can serve as crossing structures, with studies in Ireland and France finding that two or three bat species/species groups used overpasses, though up to three-quarters of bats crossed the road below at traffic height or crossed at other nearby locations (977). A UK study found that an overpass with planters was used by two-thirds of crossing bats, while an unvegetated overpass with a paved road over it was not used by crossing bats (977).\n\nBat gantries or bat bridges have shown mixed results, with UK studies finding that fewer bats used bat gantries than crossed the road below at traffic height, and one bat gantry was not used at all (978). A French study found that a temporary bat gantry was used by three bat species/species groups, but almost half of crossing bats flew over the road at other locations (978).\n\nDiversion structures using plantings or fencing can guide bats to safe crossing points, with a Swiss study finding that up to one fifth of lesser horseshoe bats within a colony flew along an artificial hedgerow to commute (981).",
