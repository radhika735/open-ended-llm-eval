Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration have been shown to protect large numbers of amphibians from death during breeding migrations (Action 842). Human-assisted crossings involve people helping migrating amphibians across roads, with studies showing large numbers moved ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million annually, though populations still declined 64-70% over 6-10 years despite assistance and 7% of sites still had over 500 toads killed on roads (Action 784).

Barrier fencing along roads, when combined with culverts, decreased amphibian road deaths in seven of eight studies, with barriers needing to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent climbing, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers during breeding migrations (Action 756). Restoring habitat connectivity has shown success, with one study finding that raising a road on a viaduct to restore connectivity between wetlands significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840). Installing barriers and crossing structures along roads/railways showed mixed results for reptiles, with some studies finding reduced road mortalities while others found no reduction or even increased percentages of mortalities (Action 3507).",

A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included thinning, shelterwood harvesting, and harvesting groups of trees, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 852, 851, 844). \n\nFor thinning, studies found mixed effects on salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, with some showing higher abundance in thinned forests while others found mixed results depending on species, life stage and time since harvest. Specifically, emigrating salamanders used thinned forest significantly more than clearcuts, though thinning decreased the body condition of ensatina salamanders 10 years after harvest (Action 852).\n\nShelterwood harvesting compared to clearcutting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance in three USA studies (Action 851). However, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting in three USA studies (Action 844).\n\nLeave-tree harvesting, where a low density of trees is left during harvest, did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting in two USA studies (Action 846). All partial harvesting methods studied (thinning, shelterwood, group harvesting, and leave-tree harvesting) decreased salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest areas and affected reproductive parameters such as the proportion of female salamanders carrying eggs and juveniles (Actions 852, 851, 844, 846).",
