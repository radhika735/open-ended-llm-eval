    "relevant_summary": "Several actions have been shown to effectively increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyard conditions. Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic ones has demonstrated increased organic matter in soils across multiple studies from Mediterranean countries including France, Italy, Spain, and Turkey (Action 1366). Adding compost to the soil has consistently shown to increase organic matter levels, with twelve replicated studies from Mediterranean regions like Italy and Spain finding more organic matter in soils with compost amendments (Action 1362). Planting and maintaining ground cover in vineyards has proven effective, with ten studies from Mediterranean climates including Chile, France, and Spain finding increased organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to bare soils (Action 1367). Growing cover crops beneath vines or between crop rows has also shown positive results, with controlled trials demonstrating increased soil organic matter under cover crops (Action 897). Additionally, adding manure to soil has been found to increase plant cover and soil health (Action 1695).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil.

A meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean-type climates found more organic matter (measured as carbon) in soils with winter cover crops compared to soils without them (Action 1345). Cover cropping also showed increased microbial biomass, bacteria, fungi, and beneficial mycorrhizal fungi in soils from comparable regions (Spain and Italy), along with more water-stable soil aggregates that improve soil structure (Action 1345). Water availability studies from Spain found mixed results, with some showing less water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation from plots with cover crops, though one study found more water loss through drainage in some comparisons (Action 1357). For crop production, studies from Spain demonstrated varied effects on yields: some found lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them, while others found higher yields or inconsistent differences between treatments (Action 1351). The quality of cash crops showed no differences between plots with or without winter cover crops in studies from comparable Mediterranean climates (Spain and Italy) (Action 1351).",
