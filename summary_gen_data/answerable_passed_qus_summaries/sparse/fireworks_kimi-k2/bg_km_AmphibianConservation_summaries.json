    "relevant_summary": "Based on evidence from multiple studies in USA forests, partial harvesting methods show varying impacts on salamander populations compared to clearcutting. Three studies found that shelterwood harvesting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher then similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID 851). However, compared to clearcutting, harvesting trees in small groups did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance according to three studies (Action ID 844). Similarly, two studies found that leaving a low density of trees during harvest (leave-tree harvesting) did not result in higher salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID 846).\n\nA meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest methods collectively (including shelterwood harvesting, harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning, and shelterwood harvesting) resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action IDs 851, 844, 852). Regarding thinning specifically, four studies compared amphibians in thinned versus clearcut forest, with two finding higher abundance in thinned forest and two finding mixed effects depending on species, life stage and time since harvest (Action ID 852). The meta-analysis also found that partial harvest methods including thinning resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting.\n\nWhen comparing partial harvesting methods to no harvesting, the evidence shows that partial harvest methods generally decrease salamander abundance. Two studies found shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting, while two studies found harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting. Additionally, two studies found leave-tree harvesting decreased salamander abundance compared to no harvesting.\n\nThe studies consistently indicate that while partial harvesting methods may have less severe impacts on salamander populations than clearcutting, they still result in decreases in salamander abundance compared to unharvested forest conditions.",
