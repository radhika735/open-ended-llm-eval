First, modifying bat hibernacula environments has shown effectiveness, with a randomized, replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that a greater number of little brown bats infected with the white-nose syndrome fungus survived in hibernation chambers at 4\u00b0C than at 10\u00b0C, and that bats stayed in hibernation for longer in chambers at 4\u00b0C. Second, probiotic treatment as a disease management strategy has demonstrated mixed results. Two studies found that treating bats with a probiotic bacterium increased survival for little brown bats when administered at the time of infection (one study in Canada using cages in a laboratory, and one in the USA with free-flying bats), but no increased survival was found for caged bats treated within a mine in the second USA study. Additionally, the Canadian study found that bats treated with a probiotic bacterium 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms, not better. However, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of vaccinating bats against the white-nose syndrome pathogen, treating hibernacula environments to reduce the pathogen reservoir, or culling bats infected with white-nose syndrome, as indicated by the statement 'We found no studies' for each of these strategies.",
