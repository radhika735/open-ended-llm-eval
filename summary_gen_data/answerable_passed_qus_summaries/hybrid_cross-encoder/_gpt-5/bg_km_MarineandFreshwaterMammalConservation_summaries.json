Devices on fixed moorings reduced numbers or activity of grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins, and reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, while the probability of porpoises approaching within 125 m increased over 10\u201311 days (ID: 2816). Devices attached to fishing gear led to animals approaching gear less closely, fewer encounters or interactions with nets or lines, and reduced activity or sightings in surrounding areas for porpoises, dolphins, and seals (ID: 2808).",
