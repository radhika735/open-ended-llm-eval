Clearing or opening patches: cleared patches had greater butterfly species richness but lower moth species richness than unmanaged, coppiced, or closed-canopy forest; large cleared patches supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest; macro-moth abundance was lower on wider rides, and macro-moth richness on rides was similar to mature forest; butterfly abundance often increased (including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary), with some declines over the first three years; heath fritillary abundance was higher 2\u20134 years after clearance than in older or first-year patches; a translocated baton blue population increased and survived at least two years; some species used cleared areas more and breeding sites increased; a European review reported small patch clearing benefited 19/67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938). Coppicing: different-aged coppice supported different communities and more unique macro-moth species than mature forest; butterfly richness was higher than in unmanaged woodland, while macro-moth richness and abundance were lower than in mature forest; butterfly abundance (including heath fritillary) was higher in woodland coppiced 2\u201315 years prior than in >15-year coppice; some species increased after coppicing alongside other measures, and pearl\u2011bordered fritillaries persisted longer in coppiced or young plantation woodland; released pearl\u2011bordered fritillaries bred at least once (3939). Thinning: one to four years after thinning (often with prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling), butterfly richness and abundance increased compared to unmanaged or pre-treatment conditions; partially cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest; in a tropical forest, overall fruit\u2011feeding butterfly richness, diversity, and abundance were similar to unmanaged forest, but rarer species were less frequently caught (3940).",

One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that prairies managed by rotational burning (every 1\\u20136 years) and grazing had a similar species richness of butterflies to prairies managed by rotational burning or grazing alone, but a lower diversity of butterflies than sites managed by rotational burning only. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that species richness of butterflies did not differ between prairies managed with annual rotational burning or complete burning.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (15 studies): Four replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study and three site comparison studies) in the USA\\u00a0found that under rotational burning management the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland\\u00a0and all\\u00a0butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher on prairies burned more than one, two\\u00a0or four\\u00a0years ago, or longer ago, than on prairies burned in the last one\\u00a0or two\\u00a0years, or recently. One of these studies also found that the abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. Two of these studies6,8, and an additional replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the total abundance of butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher in pine-oak barrens\\u00a0and prairies\\u00a0managed by rotational burning every 2\\u20135 years, 2\\u20133 years\\u00a0or 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0than at unmanaged sites\\u00a0or sites managed by rotational burning or grazing alone. One of these studies also found that the abundance of butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions. Four of six replicated studies in the USA (including five site comparison studies\\u00a0and one randomized, controlled study) found that rotational burning in prairies, pine barrens\\u00a0and grasslands\\u00a0had mixed effects on butterflies, compared to unmanaged, hayed, grazed, mowed or completely burned sites. The fifth study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged pine barrens or lightly managed fields. The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies. One site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years (following restoration by seeding) than on unmanaged sites or remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1\\u20132 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa\\u00a0found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"

Under power lines, different methods produced similar abundances for several species, though frosted elfin abundance was higher with mowing than cutting, and pearl-bordered fritillaries used areas 1\u20132 years post-clearance but not \u22653 years after [3855]. On road verges and urban greenspaces, reducing mowing frequency or leaving areas unmown increased butterfly and moth richness/diversity and often increased abundance (including for pearl crescent and northern pearl crescent), while late-summer mowing increased ringlet counts, less frequent or later mowing reduced traffic-related butterfly deaths, and butterflies were only recorded on mowed verges where hay was removed; scarce copper occupancy was higher on less frequently mown grasslands [3841]. Restricting or stopping herbicide use on roadsides was linked to greater butterfly richness and abundance and lower mortality risk in restored roadside prairies, while transmission lines that were neither sprayed nor mown had higher abundance of northern pearl crescent and pearl crescent but similar total abundance and species richness compared to sprayed and mown sites [3899]. Restoring or maintaining species-rich grassland along verges (e.g., sowing native wildflowers, increasing larval host plants, higher plant species richness/flowering) increased richness and, in several cases, abundance of butterflies, day-flying/burnet moths, and meadow-specialist moths relative to verges dominated by non-native vegetation, though some measures did not increase abundance of meadow-specialist butterflies/moths; wider verges supported higher richness and abundance; restored prairie verges sometimes had lower butterfly mortality risk than non-native short grass verges, but another study found more roadkill on roads with tall meadow verges and where central reservations had habitat; in Canada, managed verges (mown once/twice or unmown) had similar richness and abundance to remnant prairies, and monarch caterpillar parasite loads were similar between verge and prairie sites [3854].",

Floristically enhanced grass buffers or wildflower strips also showed higher butterfly richness and abundance than standard grass margins or uncultivated margins in UK and Swedish studies [3982]. In contrast, uncultivated margins often had lower butterfly richness and abundance than margins sown with grasses/forbs or wildflowers, though outcomes improved when margins were wider/longer, left uncut or only cut outside summer, and located near existing grassland; some studies reported similar or higher values under specific conditions [3981]. A Swedish comparison within grass margins found those sown with legumes or clover ley had higher butterfly richness and abundance than uncultivated margins [3982].

Species richness frequently remained similar to managed sites after 3\u201320 years or an unspecified period, though some studies reported lower richness after >50 years or 6\u201313 years without mowing, and lower richness after >5\u201320 years or many years without grazing; in contrast, richness was higher in meadows not cut all summer, in grasslands abandoned 4\u201310 years versus extensively/commercially grazed, and where grazing had ceased 2\u20139 years compared to >10 years or currently grazed [3957, 3956]. Abundance responses were mixed: several studies recorded lower abundance after >1\u201320 years without mowing or grazing, while other studies found higher abundance after >3 years, temporary abandonment, or when uncut all summer; some studies reported similar abundance to grazed/mown sites, and species-specific outcomes varied [3957, 3956]. In some cases, woodland and hedgerow butterflies and burnet moths were more abundant after 1\u20136 years of abandonment, whereas grassland or farmland species declined; examples included higher abundance of Scotch argus adults and meadow neb moth caterpillars in some abandoned or uncut grasslands, and local extinctions of large blue and silver-studded blue in some abandoned meadows; heath fritillary abundance was similar around six years after abandonment but lower after >25 years, with no caterpillars [3957, 3956].",

    "relevant_summary": "Alternatives reported include thinning trees, which in coniferous woodland (sometimes alongside other management such as prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling) was associated with higher butterfly richness and/or abundance than unmanaged woodland in several studies, though one study found similar richness and abundance to unmanaged forest and partially cleared plots showed higher butterfly but lower moth richness than closed canopy forest [3940]. Selective or reduced impact logging altered butterfly community composition compared to pristine forest, with mixed effects on richness (similar to primary forest in some studies, lower than unharvested in another) and higher abundance in some reduced-impact logged forests; selectively logged sites had higher exposed moth caterpillar abundance than clearcuts in one study [3867]. Harvesting groups of trees or using thinning instead of clearcutting yielded higher macro-moth richness after thinning than after patch-cutting or clearcutting in one study, while group selection harvesting produced moth richness similar to single-tree harvesting or clearcutting but lower than unharvested forest; recovery rates after group selection were similar to clearcutting and slower than shelterwood in another study [3868]. Clearing or opening patches (including widening rides and, in some cases, alongside coppicing and grazing) increased butterfly species richness and/or abundance in multiple studies, though moth richness and macro-moth abundance were sometimes lower than in closed or mature forest; effects could decline over the first three years after clearing, and larger clearings supported higher butterfly richness/abundance in some comparisons [3938]. Coppicing woodland supported different moth and butterfly communities than mature forest; studies reported higher butterfly richness and/or abundance (including species such as heath fritillary) in recently or younger coppice compared to unmanaged or older stands, while macro-moth richness and abundance were lower than in mature forest in some studies [3939]. Encouraging natural regeneration in former plantations or logged forests yielded moth richness and abundance higher than plantations in one study, and butterfly richness and abundance similar to pristine forests but peaking 12\u201325 years after felling in another; rarity patterns varied compared to thinned forests [3876]. Creating young plantations within mature woodland was associated with higher persistence probabilities over 20 years for pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearl-bordered fritillary compared to mature coniferous (both species) and deciduous (pearl-bordered fritillary) woodland [3941].",

Abundance responses were mixed: higher abundance for large copper eggs and some butterfly species under cattle/pony grazing in fens and dunes, similar abundance to ungrazed in shrubsteppe, lower abundance in meadow steppe under livestock, and on saltmarsh light grazing increased total micro-moth abundance and some caterpillars compared to moderate/heavy grazing or ungrazed, though other caterpillars were lower under grazing than ungrazed; upland rough grassland had higher butterfly abundance than improved grassland (3944). Occupancy/use: brown argus and Alcon large blue were more likely to occupy grazed calcareous dunes and heathland than unmanaged or differently managed sites (3944). Prescribed fire in open habitats: Species richness of butterflies was often similar between burned and unburned shrubland plots and field margins; patch-burning in pastures yielded lower richness than rotational grazing, similar to some grazed/mown pastures, and higher than continuous grazing (3882). Abundance responses were mixed: increased abundance for heath fritillary adults, marsh fritillary caterpillar webs, and Fender\u2019s blue caterpillars/eggs one or more years after burning compared to before or to unburned/grazed land, but decreased abundance for Brenton blue eggs/adults, rosy marsh moth caterpillars, and regal fritillary on burned sites versus unburned; some species (e.g., regal fritillary, arogos skipper) were less abundant on burned prairies than hayed/grazed, while generalists and some species (e.g., purplish copper) were more abundant on burned than hayed/grazed; one review reported occasional grassland burning benefitted 10/67 species of conservation concern (3882).

Removing, controlling, or excluding vertebrate herbivores: Studies from multiple countries and a global review found that fencing to exclude or reduce densities of deer, sheep, pigs, and large herbivores sometimes increased butterfly and macro-moth species richness, with mixed effects when excluding elk, and the global review found no effect on richness in temperate and boreal forests; abundance was often higher in fenced plots, though effects were mixed with elk, overall moth abundance was similar but tree-feeding moth abundance lower in sika deer\u2013excluded forest, and a global review found increased abundance when grazing/browsing was reduced; in the Netherlands, all Glanville fritillary caterpillar nests survived and fewer nests were damaged in sheep-excluded grassland compared to grazed areas [3891].

(2) Population persistence often required continued interventions such as captive-rearing of wild-laid caterpillars or supplementation by further releases (3914). (3) Survival and persistence varied with source and approach: translocated large copper caterpillars had higher survival than released, captive-bred caterpillars (3909), and released captive-bred large copper caterpillars had lower survival than captive, wild or translocated caterpillars (3914). (4) Life stage and context of release varied (eggs, caterpillars, pupae, adults), with reports of populations persisting 2\u201328 years in some cases, while others died out within 0\u201312 years or required further releases (3914; 3909). (5) Captive-rearing conditions affected survival and condition, including lower density improving survival, temperature (20 \u00b0C higher survival than 25 \u00b0C), ant colony context for myrmecophilous species (higher survival without queens or with winged females present), differences among ant species and among host plant species, and the origin of ants (from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur) influencing survival (3916). (6) Overwintering method during captive rearing influenced survival (lower in refrigerators than in environmental chambers or outside) (3916). (7) Diet and symbiont availability during captive rearing affected development and adult condition, including plant species provided and access to appropriate ant colonies (3916). (8) Long-term captivity influenced traits, with captive lines showing differences in body size and wing size, and differences in fecundity relative to more recently captive lines (3916). (9) Placement of parasitic blue butterflies into specific ant nests without queens improved caterpillar survival during translocation (3909). (10) Genetic considerations were noted, with a translocated population showing similar genetic diversity to its source after 19 years (3909).

Hedgerows also supported higher abundances of butterflies, moths/macro\u2011moths and gatekeepers than beetle banks, grass margins without hedgerows, field interiors, or locations 5\u201310 m from hedgerows, while one study found similar abundance to grass banks between fields [3976]. Moths recorded close to hedgerows were more likely to fly parallel to them than moths further away [3976]. Within planted hedgerows, gorse, oak and blackthorn hosted more species of arthropods, including caterpillars, than commonly planted hawthorn [3976]. Managing existing hedgerows to increase structural complexity or include trees was linked to higher species richness or diversity of butterflies and macro\u2011moths than simpler hedgerows without trees [3975]. Cutting regimes that allow incremental growth, cutting once every 2\u20133 years, or autumn cutting were associated with higher abundance of adult butterflies and moths, moth caterpillars and pupae, and more brown hairstreak eggs than annual, same\u2011size cutting, although in some cases caterpillar/pupa abundance was similar between regimes [3975]. Hedgerows kept 1\u20132 m tall had higher butterfly species richness than those kept below 1 m, while one study reported more adult butterflies in hedgerows maintained below 1 m; fields with larger\u2011volume hedgerows showed higher butterfly richness and abundance in one of two years [3975]. Hedgerows with trees or more complex structure had higher abundance of butterflies and pale shining brown moths, though some studies found similar total macro\u2011moth abundance with or without trees [3975]. Scalloped hedgerow edges supported more brown hairstreak eggs than straight edges, and field margins next to hedgerow trees had higher abundance of most shrub\u2011/tree\u2011feeding moth species than margins away from trees [3975].

Abundances in set-asides were sometimes higher than in cereal fields (especially in second-year or less-competitive grass mixes) but were frequently similar to arable fields, pasture, uncultivated field boundaries, or extensively farmed land; in one USA study, abundance was similar to native prairie in year one but lower thereafter [3980].

Butterfly abundance was higher in woodland coppiced two, two\u2013four, five\u2013seven or 12\u201315 years ago than in woodland coppiced 5\u201311 or >15 years ago (3939). For moths, abundance was similar in woodland coppiced 1\u20134, 5\u20138 and 12\u201320 years ago, and macro-moth abundance was lower in coppiced woodland than in mature forest with no change across coppice ages (3939).",

    "relevant_summary": "Across five studies, landscapes and farms with smaller fields had higher butterfly and burnet moth abundance, and in some cases higher species richness, than areas with larger fields; two replicated site comparisons found higher richness with smaller fields, two found similar richness, and a before-and-after study found richness increased after reducing field size alongside more edges and margins (3974). Fifteen studies on grass margins reported that wider margins (up to 6 m) often supported greater species richness or diversity of butterflies, macro\u2011moths and micro\u2011moths than narrower or conventional margins, though one study found macro\u2011moth richness similar between wide and conventional margins (3982). Seven site comparison studies (including paired designs) found wider grass margins (up to 6 m) had higher abundance of habitat\u2011sensitive butterflies, macro\u2011moths and micro\u2011moths than narrower or conventional margins, while other studies found similar abundance for disturbance\u2011tolerant butterflies and some moth groups (3982). Replicated controlled studies showed grass margins, compared to cropped edges, often had higher butterfly abundance and sometimes higher richness; however, one UK study found 2\u2011m margins increased butterfly richness over cropped edges while 6\u2011m margins did not (3982). A UK paired comparison found margins next to water bodies with restricted agrochemical use (and restricted mowing/grazing) had greater moth abundance but similar moth species richness than conventionally managed margins (3894). UK studies on beetle banks showed micro\u2011moth richness and abundance were higher on beetle banks and AES\u2011managed margins than on conventionally managed margins, while adult butterflies were less abundant and less species\u2011rich on beetle banks than along hedgerows; caterpillar abundance was similar between beetle banks and field margins or crop fields (3927). Some studies reported that floristically enhanced or wildflower\u2011sown margins/strips had higher butterfly richness and abundance than standard grass margins or cropped/unsown edges; in other cases richness or abundance was similar or mixed among butterfly and moth groups (3932, 3982).",
