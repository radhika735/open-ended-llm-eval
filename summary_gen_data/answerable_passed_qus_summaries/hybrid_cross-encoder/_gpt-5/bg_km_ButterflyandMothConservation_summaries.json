Clearing or opening patches: cleared patches had greater butterfly species richness but lower moth species richness than unmanaged, coppiced, or closed-canopy forest; large cleared patches supported higher butterfly richness and abundance than undisturbed forest; macro-moth abundance was lower on wider rides, and macro-moth richness on rides was similar to mature forest; butterfly abundance often increased (including chequered blue, woodland brown, high brown fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary), with some declines over the first three years; heath fritillary abundance was higher 2\u20134 years after clearance than in older or first-year patches; a translocated baton blue population increased and survived at least two years; some species used cleared areas more and breeding sites increased; a European review reported small patch clearing benefited 19/67 butterfly species of conservation concern (3938). Coppicing: different-aged coppice supported different communities and more unique macro-moth species than mature forest; butterfly richness was higher than in unmanaged woodland, while macro-moth richness and abundance were lower than in mature forest; butterfly abundance (including heath fritillary) was higher in woodland coppiced 2\u201315 years prior than in >15-year coppice; some species increased after coppicing alongside other measures, and pearl\u2011bordered fritillaries persisted longer in coppiced or young plantation woodland; released pearl\u2011bordered fritillaries bred at least once (3939). Thinning: one to four years after thinning (often with prescribed burning, mulching, or nearby felling), butterfly richness and abundance increased compared to unmanaged or pre-treatment conditions; partially cleared plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest; in a tropical forest, overall fruit\u2011feeding butterfly richness, diversity, and abundance were similar to unmanaged forest, but rarer species were less frequently caught (3940).",

However, one of these studies also found that the species richness of grassland butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions. Two replicated, site comparison studies in the USA\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one\\u00a0or four\\u00a0years ago than on prairies burned in the last one\\u00a0or two\\u00a0years under rotational burning management. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that prairies managed by rotational burning (every 1\\u20136 years) and grazing had a similar species richness of butterflies to prairies managed by rotational burning or grazing alone, but a lower diversity of butterflies than sites managed by rotational burning only. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that species richness of butterflies did not differ between prairies managed with annual rotational burning or complete burning.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (15 studies): Four replicated studies (including one paired, controlled study and three site comparison studies) in the USA\\u00a0found that under rotational burning management the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland\\u00a0and all\\u00a0butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher on prairies burned more than one, two\\u00a0or four\\u00a0years ago, or longer ago, than on prairies burned in the last one\\u00a0or two\\u00a0years, or recently. One of these studies also found that the abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning. Two of these studies6,8, and an additional replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the total abundance of butterflies, and of most insects including butterflies and moths, was higher in pine-oak barrens\\u00a0and prairies\\u00a0managed by rotational burning every 2\\u20135 years, 2\\u20133 years\\u00a0or 1\\u20136 years\\u00a0than at unmanaged sites\\u00a0or sites managed by rotational burning or grazing alone. One of these studies also found that the abundance of butterflies was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning than in unmanaged prairies in one of two regions. Four of six replicated studies in the USA (including five site comparison studies\\u00a0and one randomized, controlled study) found that rotational burning in prairies, pine barrens\\u00a0and grasslands\\u00a0had mixed effects on butterflies, compared to unmanaged, hayed, grazed, mowed or completely burned sites. The fifth study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged pine barrens or lightly managed fields. The sixth study found that for three fritillary species rotational burning in prairies did not affect abundance, but for three others, in at least one region surveyed, abundance was lower in prairies managed by rotational burning, sometimes in combination with haying, grazing and/or mowing, than in prairies managed with only haying or grazing, or in unmanaged prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance was similar in rotationally burned and unmanaged oak savannas and prairies. One site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0reported that regal fritillary abundance was higher in grasslands and oak barrens managed by rotational burning every three years (following restoration by seeding) than on unmanaged sites or remnant prairies. One replicated, site comparison study in the USA\\u00a0found that the abundance of regal fritillary was higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn than one or eight years after the last burn. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA\\u00a0found that, in June, the abundance of regal fritillaries in prairies burned on rotation that spring was lower than in prairies burned 1\\u20132 years ago, but in July the abundance was higher in recently burned prairies.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated study in South Africa\\u00a0found that populations of Karkloof blue persisted for at least a year following rotational burning.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
