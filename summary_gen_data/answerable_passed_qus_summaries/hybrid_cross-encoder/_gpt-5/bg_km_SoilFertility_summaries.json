A review reported that tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and that no\u2011till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources. A small replicated UK trial found more Farmland Bird Index species on broadcast than on non\u2011inversion tillage fields. Two studies examining long\u2011term effects (10 years) found mixed outcomes for earthworms: one showed higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, while another found no difference in earthworm abundance compared to conventional tillage. Documented harms or non\u2011benefits include: negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on abundance/biomass/species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms) and earthworms; no effect or reductions in the number of different plant species found as seeds and in some weed species; no effect on mammal abundance; no effect for some bird species; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; and crop type influenced weed numbers under different tillage regimes.

In contrast, cover crops grown when fields are otherwise empty (often winter cover crops) affected water and nutrient dynamics: multiple replicated, randomized, controlled studies commonly found lower soil water content, though some found higher content; water losses via drainage/runoff/evaporation were often lower, with one study finding higher drainage; infiltration sometimes increased; herbicide leaching decreased; nitrate leaching often decreased (with one study finding similar nitrate to fallow), and runoff sometimes had less suspended sediment, alongside changes in ammonium, dissolved carbon, and phosphorus (1357). For pests and weeds, studies on arable fields reported mixed outcomes: living mulches between broccoli sometimes had fewer aphids but also fewer parasitized aphids; crop disease and damage were often similar to fallow or no-cover controls, with less-severely diseased lettuce in some comparisons; weed pressure was often lower but could be higher or inconsistent, and weed communities could differ (1394).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Three studies found a reduction in weed growth, and three found effects varied between years, weed groups, or the type of weeding method in controls.Four studies from Asia \\u00a0and North America examined the effect on weeds by comparing amended soils with unweeded controls. Two studies found a reduction in weed growth, but one found that residues applied too far in advance of crop planting had the reverse effect. Two studies found that effects varied between trials, weed species or the type of residue used.Two studies, including one randomised, replicated, controlled laboratory study, found that the decrease in weeds did not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation. Pests: One randomised, replicated, controlled study in the Philippines found mixed effects on pests. Crop growth: Two of three studies found crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains, but this could be minimised by changing the timing of application. One study found effects varied between years. Yield: Three\\u00a0randomised, replicated, controlled studies compared yields in amended plots with weeded controls and found positive, negative and\\u00a0mixed effects. Three studies compared amended plots with unweeded controls, two found positive effects on yield and one found mixed effects (depending on the crop). Profit: One study found that amending soils increased profit compared to unweeded controls, but not compared to weeded controls.\\n\\u00a0\\nCrops studied were beans, cotton, maize, rice and wheat.\"\n}"
