A review reported that tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and that no\u2011till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources. A small replicated UK trial found more Farmland Bird Index species on broadcast than on non\u2011inversion tillage fields. Two studies examining long\u2011term effects (10 years) found mixed outcomes for earthworms: one showed higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, while another found no difference in earthworm abundance compared to conventional tillage. Documented harms or non\u2011benefits include: negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on abundance/biomass/species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms) and earthworms; no effect or reductions in the number of different plant species found as seeds and in some weed species; no effect on mammal abundance; no effect for some bird species; one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time; and crop type influenced weed numbers under different tillage regimes.

In contrast, cover crops grown when fields are otherwise empty (often winter cover crops) affected water and nutrient dynamics: multiple replicated, randomized, controlled studies commonly found lower soil water content, though some found higher content; water losses via drainage/runoff/evaporation were often lower, with one study finding higher drainage; infiltration sometimes increased; herbicide leaching decreased; nitrate leaching often decreased (with one study finding similar nitrate to fallow), and runoff sometimes had less suspended sediment, alongside changes in ammonium, dissolved carbon, and phosphorus (1357). For pests and weeds, studies on arable fields reported mixed outcomes: living mulches between broccoli sometimes had fewer aphids but also fewer parasitized aphids; crop disease and damage were often similar to fallow or no-cover controls, with less-severely diseased lettuce in some comparisons; weed pressure was often lower but could be higher or inconsistent, and weed communities could differ (1394).",
