For algal abundance in Australia, Israel and the UK, several studies found no increase when using quarried rock or recycled\\u2011cement\\u2011concrete, while others reported mixed effects, including increased red and green macroalgal abundance with quarried rock in one study [3470]. For invertebrates in Australia, Israel and the UK, abundance responses were mixed; some studies found no increases for several sessile taxa with quarried rock (and a decrease for Spirorbid tubeworms in one study), while one study found shell\\u2011concrete increased bivalve abundance [3470]. In Israel, one study reported that ECOncrete with grooves, holes and pits had mixed effects on fish abundances depending on species group [3470].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3470\"\n  ]\n}"
