Installing culverts/tunnels as road crossings reduced amphibian road deaths in six of seven studies (one only when barrier fencing was also installed), though one study found no effect; many studies documented use of culverts/tunnels by amphibians (e.g., 15\u201385% of individuals, 3\u201315 species, or 23\u2013100% of culverts used), while others reported mixed or low use, with use influenced by culvert diameter (wider used more), length (long avoided), lighting (mixed effects), substrate (natural favored), presence of water (mixed), entrance location, and tunnel climate; designs such as one-way vertical-entry chutes caused high mortality of common toads, steel culvert condensation had very high metal concentrations, and one study reported thousands of amphibians still killed on the road (884).",
