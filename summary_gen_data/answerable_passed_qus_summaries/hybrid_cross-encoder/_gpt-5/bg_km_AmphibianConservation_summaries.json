Two studies (including one review) in the UK\\u00a0reported that captive-bred large copper\\u00a0and belted beauty moth\\u00a0populations released as caterpillars (sometimes into managed habitat) died out one, two\\u00a0or 12\\u00a0years after release, or required further releases to survive. One replicated study in the UK\\u00a0reported that three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations released as caterpillars (and in one case as adults) established, and at least one persisted for five years. One review across the UK and Ireland\\u00a0found that 25% of captive-bred and translocated butterfly populations survived for &gt;3 years, but 38% died out in that time, and only 8% were known to have survived for &gt;10 years.\\nReproductive success (2 studies): One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that after the release of a captive-bred population of large copper, the number of eggs laid/female increased over the first three years. One before-and-after study in the UK reported captive-bred adult pearl-bordered fritillaries released into coppiced woodland successfully bred at least once.\\nSurvival (3 studies): Three studies (including two replicated, site comparison studies and one review) in the UK\\u00a0and the UK and the Netherlands\\u00a0found that released, captive-bred large copper caterpillars had a lower survival rate than captive, wild\\u00a0or translocated caterpillars.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
