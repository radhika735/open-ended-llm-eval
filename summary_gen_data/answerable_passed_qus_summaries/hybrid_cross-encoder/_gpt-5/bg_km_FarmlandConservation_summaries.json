Electric fencing increased numbers or nests at some colonies and often raised survival or productivity; it reduced mammalian predation inside exclosures but bird predation was higher (188). Individual nest exclosures or barriers increased fledging success for tree and ground nests and lowered predation in multiple studies (400). Predator-proof perimeter fencing around breeding sites is proposed but currently has no captured evidence of effects (109). Protecting nests from livestock using cages or fencing prevented trampling and was associated with population increase in a multi-intervention case; no protected nests were trampled in a replicated test (237). Creating uncropped, cultivated margins or lapwing plots provided benefits including increased northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success, and breeding use of plots by several farmland birds, though effects were mixed for some species and weeds were more common on margins (562). A systematic review found that excluding predators from nests significantly increased hatching success, though individual barriers could have adverse impacts (396). Using multiple barriers showed mixed results; adding an electric fence around already protected nests did not raise fledging success, while removing an outer fence earlier appeared to reduce predation (404).",

    "relevant_summary": "- Bees: Across European studies from Germany, Poland and the UK, solitary bee nest boxes were readily used; in some cases local population size or the number of emerging red mason bees increased when boxes were provided, and the number of occupied solitary bee nests almost doubled over three years with repeated provision at a site (80). Reported occupancy rates for solitary bee boxes ranged from 1\u201326% of cavities, and the highest production of red mason bees per nest occurred in reed stems or wood; recommended placement is 150\u2013600 m from forage resources based on German studies (80). Additional replicated work including farmland in Germany found many solitary bee species, including endangered species, used boxes; repeated provision on agricultural land (including in Germany) saw occupied nests double over three years; German studies estimated foraging ranges of 150\u2013600 m; parasitism and mortality in boxes were recorded, with one German study finding 13% mortality and 2% parasitism for cavity-nesting bees and wasps (47). There is no evidence on the effects of introducing nest boxes already stocked with solitary bees on farmland wildlife (81). Two trials testing bumblebee nest boxes found very low uptake (\u22642%) (80).\n- Birds: On European farmland and other agricultural habitats, studies from the Netherlands and the UK reported increases in Eurasian kestrel clutches and breeding tree sparrows following provision of nest boxes (155). Occupancy of nest boxes in agricultural habitats was recorded for multiple species including Eurasian kestrel, long-eared owl, common starling, tits Parus spp., tree sparrow, stock dove, jackdaw, Eurasian wryneck and Eurasian hoopoe across Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK; carrion crows did not nest in artificial trees, and UK tree sparrows preferred boxes in wetland over farmland sites (155).

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Two studies were in Finland, and one was in each of Switzerland, Sweden, the UK\\u00a0and Germany.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (3 STUDIES)\\n\\nCommunity composition (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing had different butterfly communities to existing species-rich grasslands, and they did not become more similar over time.\\nRichness/diversity (3 studies): One of two replicated, site comparison studies in Finland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and grazing had a similar species richness of butterflies and burnet moths to both unrestored and continuously managed grassland. The other study found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower species richness of butterflies and day-flying moths than unrestored and continuously managed grasslands. One replicated, site comparison study in the UK\\u00a0found that the species richness of butterflies on semi-natural grasslands restored by scrub clearance and the reintroduction of grazing or mowing remained similar over time since restoration.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (5 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (5 studies): Two of five replicated, site comparison studies (including one paired study) in Switzerland, Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands restored by cattle grazing had a lower total abundance of butterflies and day-flying moths, and of 13 out of 32 individual species, than unmanaged, abandoned grasslands, but that three species had higher abundance, and three had lower abundance, on restored grasslands than on continuously grazed grasslands. Two studies found that grasslands restored by scrub clearing and grazing\\u00a0or mowing\\u00a0had a similar abundance of butterflies and burnet moths\\u00a0and heath fritillaries\\u00a0to unmanaged grasslands\\u00a0and continuously managed grasslands, although the abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars was lower on restored grasslands than on continuously managed grasslands. The fifth study found that the density of blue-spot hairstreak eggs, and egg batches, was higher in grasslands restored by scrub cutting than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (1 STUDY)\\n\\nUse (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in Germany found that in grasslands restored by scrub cutting, a greater proportion of small buckthorn bushes contained blue-spot hairstreak eggs than in unrestored or continuously managed grasslands.\"\n}"
