Uncropped margins sown with native wildflower mixes and subsequently mown support higher bumblebee abundance (and, in several trials, higher species richness) than cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins; inclusion of perennial leguminous herbs is an important forage source, especially for long\u2011tongued species, and one small trial found long\u2011tongued species preferred perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage mixes [19]. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins often have more bumblebees (and sometimes more species) than cropped margins, but their value can be inconsistent year to year and may rely on thistles that are often controlled as weeds; some trials found no increase over cropped margins [20]. In the first year, agricultural forage mixes (including legumes) attracted more bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes in some trials [18].",
