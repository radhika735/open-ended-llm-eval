Soil biological indicators frequently improved: microbial biomass increased in some studies, bacteria and fungi were higher in Spain, and beneficial mycorrhizal spores/species were higher in Italy, while earthworm responses were mixed [1345]. Physical soil properties and erosion tended to improve: cover crops reduced soil erosion in Israel and increased water-stable aggregates in Spain [1345]. Hydrologically, findings were mixed: in Spain one study found greater cover crop water use and another no difference; across France, Israel and Spain several studies found reduced water losses via runoff, drainage or evaporation, although one Spanish study found greater drainage with winter cover crops; nitrate leaching was reduced in Spain in some comparisons [1357]. Crop production outcomes were variable: studies from Spain and Italy reported lower, higher, or no change in cash crop yields with winter cover crops in different comparisons; however, several studies reported higher yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes [1351].",

Soil biological indicators frequently improved: microbial biomass increased in some studies, bacteria and fungi were higher in Spain, and beneficial mycorrhizal spores/species were higher in Italy, while earthworm responses were mixed [1345]. Physical soil properties and erosion tended to improve: cover crops reduced soil erosion in Israel and increased water-stable aggregates in Spain [1345]. Hydrologically, findings were mixed: in Spain one study found greater cover crop water use and another no difference; across France, Israel and Spain several studies found reduced water losses via runoff, drainage or evaporation, although one Spanish study found greater drainage with winter cover crops; nitrate leaching was reduced in Spain in some comparisons [1357]. Crop production outcomes were variable: studies from Spain and Italy reported lower, higher, or no change in cash crop yields with winter cover crops in different comparisons; however, several studies reported higher yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes [1351].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1345\",\n    \"1357\",\n    \"1351\"\n  ]\n}"

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness.

Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches.
