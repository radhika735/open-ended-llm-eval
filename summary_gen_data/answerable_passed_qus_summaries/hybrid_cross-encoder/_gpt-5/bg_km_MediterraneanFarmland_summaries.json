Soil biological indicators frequently improved: microbial biomass increased in some studies, bacteria and fungi were higher in Spain, and beneficial mycorrhizal spores/species were higher in Italy, while earthworm responses were mixed [1345]. Physical soil properties and erosion tended to improve: cover crops reduced soil erosion in Israel and increased water-stable aggregates in Spain [1345]. Hydrologically, findings were mixed: in Spain one study found greater cover crop water use and another no difference; across France, Israel and Spain several studies found reduced water losses via runoff, drainage or evaporation, although one Spanish study found greater drainage with winter cover crops; nitrate leaching was reduced in Spain in some comparisons [1357]. Crop production outcomes were variable: studies from Spain and Italy reported lower, higher, or no change in cash crop yields with winter cover crops in different comparisons; however, several studies reported higher yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes [1351].",

Soil nitrogen was higher in some comparisons but overall results were inconsistent; using legumes as cover crops increased soil nitrogen relative to non-legumes in multiple studies [1345]. Soil biological indicators frequently improved: microbial biomass increased in some studies, bacteria and fungi were higher in Spain, and beneficial mycorrhizal spores/species were higher in Italy, while earthworm responses were mixed [1345]. Physical soil properties and erosion tended to improve: cover crops reduced soil erosion in Israel and increased water-stable aggregates in Spain [1345]. Hydrologically, findings were mixed: in Spain one study found greater cover crop water use and another no difference; across France, Israel and Spain several studies found reduced water losses via runoff, drainage or evaporation, although one Spanish study found greater drainage with winter cover crops; nitrate leaching was reduced in Spain in some comparisons [1357]. Crop production outcomes were variable: studies from Spain and Italy reported lower, higher, or no change in cash crop yields with winter cover crops in different comparisons; however, several studies reported higher yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes [1351].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1345\",\n    \"1357\",\n    \"1351\"\n  ]\n}"
