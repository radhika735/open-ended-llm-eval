Herbicide reduced bracken biomass/cover in multiple UK studies and increased heather seedlings and biomass, though two randomized, controlled UK studies found no increase in heather cover (1652). Cutting reduced bracken cover/biomass in studies in Norway and the UK and increased heather cover or biomass in some trials, but other UK studies found no increase in heather cover or seedling abundance (1653). Cutting followed by herbicide reduced bracken cover/biomass and increased heather cover in Norway, but a UK study found no change in heather biomass; one UK study reported no significant effect on cover of several plant species (1654). Cutting then rotovating did not increase total plant biomass or heather biomass in a UK study (1656). Using herbicide with leaf litter removal did not increase total plant biomass after eight years, but in three of six years heather biomass was higher than with herbicide alone (1660). No studies were found evaluating cut and burn, increased livestock numbers, or herbicide plus grazing for bracken control in shrublands (1655, 1659, 1661).",
