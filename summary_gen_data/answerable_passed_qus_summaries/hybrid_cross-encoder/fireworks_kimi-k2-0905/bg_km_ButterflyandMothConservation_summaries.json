Two studies found that leaving unburned patches during prescribed burning increased Karner blue butterfly abundance over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies, with specialist butterfly species showing mixed responses (six out of nine species were more abundant, one less abundant, two similar). Karner blue butterflies were observed using all 11 unburned patches surveyed.\n\nSeventeen studies on rotational burning showed more complex outcomes. Rotational burning every 2-5 years resulted in higher butterfly species richness compared to unmanaged sites or annual burning in pine-oak barrens and semi-natural grasslands. The abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and total butterflies was generally higher on prairies burned more than 1-4 years ago compared to recently burned areas. However, effects varied by species and time since burning - some studies found mixed effects on individual butterfly species, with some fritillary species showing lower abundance under rotational burning compared to haying or grazing management. The abundance of regal fritillary was found to be higher in rotationally burned prairies four years after the last burn compared to one or eight years post-burn.",

Other suggested but untested actions include restricting the use of polarized light (Action 3903), minimizing road lighting (Action 3852), restricting lighting timing (Action 3901), removing or changing turbine lighting (Action 3843), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from buildings (Action 3905), and using barriers or vegetation to block artificial light (Action 3618).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3904\",\n    \"3903\",\n    \"3902\",\n    \"3852\",\n    \"3906\",\n    \"3901\",\n    \"3843\",\n    \"3905\",\n    \"1994\",\n    \"3618\"\n  ]\n}"

For translocation studies, some populations persist for decades and increase in abundance, with one study reporting survival for up to 49 years, while others die out within 0-7 years. A review across the UK and Ireland found that only 25% of translocated butterfly populations survived for at least three years, 38% died out within three years, and only 8% were known to survive for more than 10 years. For captive-release programs, some populations persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while others died out within 1-12 years or required ongoing supplementation to survive. One study found that just three of 10 released barberry carpet moth populations successfully established, though at least one persisted for five years. Survival rates for released captive-bred butterflies were often lower than wild-born individuals, similar to findings with mammals. While some translocated populations have survived for decades and maintained genetic diversity comparable to source populations, the overall pattern suggests that butterfly population re-establishment through these methods has a low success rate, with many populations requiring ongoing management or supplementary releases to persist long-term.",

Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species has shown mixed results - three of five studies found that areas planted with native species had greater species richness of butterflies and moths, while two studies found similar richness regardless of plant origin (action 3842). Stopping pesticide use can increase butterfly abundance, as one study found that gardens without insecticide and herbicide use had higher butterfly abundance than those using chemicals (action 3900). Eliminating herbicide use on pavements and road verges has shown positive effects, with one study finding restored roadside areas without herbicide restrictions had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to heavily managed verges (action 3899). Altering mowing regimes can significantly help - less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths compared to regularly mown areas in multiple studies (action 3841). Establishing \"green infrastructure\" like green roofs can provide habitat, though studies show they typically have lower butterfly richness than urban parks, with richness increasing on older green roofs with more nectar plants and larger areas (action 3837). Protecting existing greenfield sites or undeveloped land is effective, with studies in Singapore and Mexico finding higher butterfly species richness in protected native forest and grassland compared to urban parks or non-native plantations (action 3836).",

One study found that species richness of macro-moths was higher after shelterwood harvesting compared to patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness levels similar to thinned and unharvested forests. Another study showed that shelterwood harvesting resulted in faster recovery of moth species richness compared to group selection harvesting or clearcutting. However, one replicated study found that forests managed by shelterwood harvesting had similar species richness of moths to forests managed by single tree harvesting, group selection harvesting, or clearcutting, but lower richness than unharvested forest. Similar patterns were observed for selective logging - forests harvested by single tree selection had comparable species richness to group selection harvesting or clearcutting, though lower than unharvested forest. The evidence suggests that while alternative harvesting methods like shelterwood and selective logging may maintain moth diversity better than clearcutting in some cases, unharvested forests consistently support the highest moth species richness.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence shows different outcomes for butterfly communities depending on the restoration approach. For grassland restoration from arable land, studies found that restored grasslands had higher species richness of butterflies and burnet moths compared to conventionally managed grasslands or cultivated farms. When grasses, legumes and other forbs were sown together, restored grasslands supported higher butterfly abundance and species richness than grass-only mixes, with communities becoming increasingly similar to high-quality grasslands over 10 years. For abandoned meadows, when grazing or mowing management is abandoned to allow natural succession, butterfly communities become dominated by generalist species, with woodland and hedgerow species increasing while grassland species decline. Studies showed mixed results for species richness - some found similar richness to managed grasslands while others found lower richness in areas abandoned for longer periods (10+ years). The key difference is that restoration from arable land through active seeding can create suitable habitat for grassland butterflies relatively quickly, while abandonment of meadows leads to succession that favors different butterfly communities with fewer specialist grassland species.",

In peatland restoration, six studies showed generally positive effects with restored bogs and mires having higher abundance and species richness of mire specialist butterflies compared to unrestored sites, and similar levels to pristine habitats. However, there were some negative impacts, including lower winter survival of large heath butterfly caterpillars where water levels had risen due to restoration, and wet heathland sites with raised water levels were less frequently occupied by Alcon large blue butterflies. For wetland management through grazing or cutting, studies found that recently cut fens had fewer large copper eggs and lower caterpillar survival compared to uncut fens, and fens managed by mowing had greater butterfly species richness than those managed by cattle grazing.

Benefits include increased butterfly species richness and abundance in coniferous or pine forests restored by burning 1-2 years prior, with four studies showing higher species richness compared to unburned forests. Leaving unburned patches within burn areas has been particularly beneficial, with six out of nine specialist butterfly species showing increased abundance and only one decreased. Karner blue butterflies increased over 2-3 years when unburned patches were retained. However, negative impacts include immediate population reductions, such as fewer Eltham copper caterpillars after selective eucalyptus forest burning, and reduced survival of Fender's blue butterfly caterpillars in burned plots. Late season burning appears less beneficial than early season burning for caterpillar populations. The evidence suggests mixed effects depending on factors like leaving unburned refugia, burn timing, and specific forest type.",

Stopping pesticide use in flower beds and greenspaces increases butterfly abundance, with one study showing gardens without insecticides and herbicides had higher butterfly abundance. Establishing green infrastructure like green roofs can support butterflies, with older green roofs containing more nectar plant species supporting higher butterfly abundance. Altering mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges is beneficial, with studies finding that less frequently mown or unmown urban areas had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths compared to frequently mown areas. Practicing wildlife gardening by reducing weeding frequency and avoiding pesticide use can increase butterfly abundance, while specific plants like buddleia and marjoram were found to be frequently visited by adult butterflies and moths. Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species was one of the most supported actions, with studies showing that areas planted with native species had greater species richness of butterflies and moths and higher abundance of caterpillars compared to areas with non-native plants. Native milkweed species were particularly important for monarch butterfly reproduction.",

Planting parks, gardens and road verges with appropriate native species was one of the most supported actions, with studies showing that areas planted with native species had greater species richness of butterflies and moths and higher abundance of caterpillars compared to areas with non-native plants. Native milkweed species were particularly important for monarch butterfly reproduction.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3900\",\n    \"3837\",\n    \"3841\",\n    \"3834\",\n    \"3842\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Sown wildflower strips consistently demonstrate superior effectiveness for butterfly communities compared to uncultivated strips in European farmland. Multiple studies show wildflower strips have higher species richness and abundance of butterflies, with 8 of 13 studies finding greater species richness/diversity compared to conventional margins, unsown margins, cropped fields, or conventional grassland, and 10 studies showing higher abundance. Uncultivated margins show mixed results - while some studies found them better than cropped field edges, several found lower species richness and abundance compared to wildflower-enhanced margins. Specifically, 2 of 5 studies found uncultivated margins had lower species richness/diversity than wildflower-enhanced margins, and 6 of 7 studies found lower abundance in uncultivated versus sown margins. Enhanced grass margins with wildflowers also perform well, showing greater species richness and higher abundance than standard grass margins or uncultivated margins. The evidence indicates actively sown wildflower strips are more beneficial for butterfly communities than passively created uncultivated margins.",
