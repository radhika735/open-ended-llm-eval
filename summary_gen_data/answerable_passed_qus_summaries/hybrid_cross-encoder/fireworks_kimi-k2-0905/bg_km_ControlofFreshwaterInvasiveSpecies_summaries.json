For industrial applications, mechanical removal combined with regular cleaning of industrial pipes proved effective for permanently removing Asian clams, while the addition of sand filters was effective for permanently reducing clam numbers (Action 1119). Temperature manipulation is another viable option, with laboratory studies showing that water temperatures of 36\u00b0C or higher killed Asian clams within or after four days (Action 1116). Physical barriers using gas-impermeable fabric covers placed across lake bottoms significantly reduced Asian clam abundance (Action 1117).",
