    "relevant_summary": "The most effective approaches for managing uncropped field margins for bumblebee conservation include sowing margins with flowering plant mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous plants, which attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated or grassy margins (Action 18). Agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes, especially those with legumes, show strong results in attracting bumblebees, though these mixes may degrade in value over time and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Native wildflower seed mixes also prove highly effective, supporting higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). These perennial wildflower mixes are particularly important for long-tongued bumblebee species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can provide benefits, with studies documenting more bumblebees foraging on these margins than on cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their effectiveness varies year to year (Action 20). Providing rough grassland areas at field margins is important for bumblebee nesting habitat, with studies showing grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins or other habitat types (Action 12). While grassy strips alone show mixed results for bumblebee diversity, 6m wide grassy margins have demonstrated enhanced abundance of wild bees in some studies (Action 14). The evidence consistently shows that margins with flowering resources, whether from sown mixes or natural regeneration, are more valuable to bumblebees than purely grassy or cropped margins.",

Three trials showed that agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes can attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year. However, natural regeneration still provides some benefits - four replicated trials in the UK found more bumblebees foraging on uncropped naturally regenerated field margins than on cropped margins, though the value of naturally regenerated margins was found to be inconsistent from year to year and often depends on thistle species considered problematic weeds. Research indicates that margins sown with agricultural legume plants may degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and require re-sowing every few years.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"18\",\n    \"20\",\n    \"19\"\n  ]\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Successful rearing has been demonstrated for several species including B. terrestris, B. vagans, B. terricola, B. rufocinctus, B. ruderatus, and B. atratus. However, complete rearing failures were documented for B. fervidus, B. pensylvanicus, and the rusty-patched bumblebee, where queens laid eggs but larvae died before reaching adulthood. Key reproductive challenges include the finding that B. terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing. Environmental factors proved critical, with pollen diet quality significantly influencing reproductive success - queens fed freshly frozen pollen were larger and survived better than those fed dried, frozen pollen, and higher protein pollen types increased worker offspring production. Optimal conditions included an eight-hour light regime and specific hibernation requirements (4-5\u00b0C for 45 days, wet weight >0.6 g, hibernation \u22644 months). Reintroduction outcomes varied considerably across seven trials - while some colonies produced good numbers of new queens, others had very low or zero queen production. A major documented challenge was social parasitism by cuckoo bees, with variable rates ranging from 0-79% across trials, though landscape management strategies showed potential for reducing parasitism rates.",

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.\\nRates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.\\nTwo replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load. The other trial, in the USA, found supplementary feeding did not increase colony productivity.\\nOne small scale trial in Norway showed that colonies of the buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris prefer to forage more than 100 m from their nest sites.\"\n}"

Disease management studies show that the antibiotic fumagillin is not effective against Nosema bombi infection in managed colonies of western bumblebee Bombus occidentalis (Action 42). However, Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella in commercial bumblebee colonies can be controlled using the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Aizawai strain at a strength of 1 g Bt/litre of water (Action 42). Commercial honey bee Apis mellifera transport packages are at risk for spreading small hive beetle, though more than half the beetles were found to escape transport packages despite using mite-killing strips (Action 41). For solitary bee management used in commercial pollination, parasites and pathogens can be problematic in Megachilidae species, though various control methods have been developed for these species which readily nest in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards (Action 54). Rearing solitary bees on artificial diets presents risks, with one study finding high larval mortality in Osmia cornuta when reared on artificial pollen-based diets including honey bee-collected pollen (Action 54), while Megachile rotundata could be reared on artificial honey bee-collected pollen diets, though synthetic pollen substitutes either caused mortality or resulted in low pre-pupal weight (Action 54).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple replicated trials across Europe shows that different sown floral mixes on agricultural land have varying effectiveness for wild bees. Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). These agricultural legume mixes also attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, particularly in the first year, though UK trials indicate they degrade in value and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18).\n\nNative wild flower seed mixes support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped fields, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species, with common long-tongued bumblebee species (Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum) strongly preferring perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage plant mixes (Action 19).\n\nPhacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) has been extensively studied, with ten trials finding substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on phacelia-rich patches, particularly bumblebees, with recorded species richness ranging from 8 to 35 species (Action 17). However, one replicated trial showed phacelia was not very attractive to wild bees in Greece (Action 17).\n\nWildflower strips generally show positive effects, with 50 out of 65 studies reporting benefits to invertebrates including wild bees (Actions 442, 3932). The evidence demonstrates that both agricultural legume mixes and native wildflower mixes can be effective, with different mixes showing varying attractiveness to different bee species and guilds.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Reducing pesticide or herbicide use generally has been studied, with one trial showing that responsible pesticide use on squash farms did not affect numbers of foraging bees (Action ID: 27). Altering the timing of insecticide applications has been investigated as a method to reduce impacts on beneficial insects (Action ID: 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels rather than preventative spraying has been tested, which can reduce the number of pesticide applications needed while maintaining crop protection (Action ID: 750). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) has been shown to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands, which may also benefit wild bees by providing pesticide-free foraging areas (Action ID: 3898). Buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins and waterways have been evaluated, with one study finding greater abundance of moths in margins managed with pesticide restrictions (Action ID: 3894). Organic farming has been studied as an alternative approach, with three European and Canadian trials showing higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional farming (Action ID: 25).",

A replicated trial in blueberry fields over three years demonstrated that the estimated number of foraging Osmia bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without nest boxes. Research in California showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species can compete with native bees for nest boxes, with introduced species sometimes occupying boxes more frequently than native bees. However, a replicated controlled trial found that using a sticky barrier (Tanglefoot) to exclude European earwigs increased the use of boxes by native bees. The study suggested that management to exclude competitors and parasites can improve nesting success for native solitary bees.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

One study from the USA found that eastern bluebirds showed this preference, but most did not switch from a soiled to a cleaned nest box. One study from the USA found that birds showed an avoidance of heavily-soiled boxes and one from Canada found that tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor preferentially selected nests which were sterilised by microwaving.\\nTwo studies from the USA found that eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis and house wrens Troglodytes aedon preferentially nested in uncleaned nest boxes, and one study found that prothonotary warblers Protonotaria citrea showed no preference for cleaned or uncleaned boxes. \\nNone of the five studies that investigated it found any difference in success or parasitism levels between cleaned and uncleaned nest boxes.\"\n}"
