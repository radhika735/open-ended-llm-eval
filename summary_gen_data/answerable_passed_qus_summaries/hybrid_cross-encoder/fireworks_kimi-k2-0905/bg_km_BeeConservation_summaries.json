    "relevant_summary": "The most effective approaches for managing uncropped field margins for bumblebee conservation include sowing margins with flowering plant mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous plants, which attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated or grassy margins (Action 18). Agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes, especially those with legumes, show strong results in attracting bumblebees, though these mixes may degrade in value over time and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Native wildflower seed mixes also prove highly effective, supporting higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). These perennial wildflower mixes are particularly important for long-tongued bumblebee species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can provide benefits, with studies documenting more bumblebees foraging on these margins than on cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their effectiveness varies year to year (Action 20). Providing rough grassland areas at field margins is important for bumblebee nesting habitat, with studies showing grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins or other habitat types (Action 12). While grassy strips alone show mixed results for bumblebee diversity, 6m wide grassy margins have demonstrated enhanced abundance of wild bees in some studies (Action 14). The evidence consistently shows that margins with flowering resources, whether from sown mixes or natural regeneration, are more valuable to bumblebees than purely grassy or cropped margins.",

Three trials showed that agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes can attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year. However, natural regeneration still provides some benefits - four replicated trials in the UK found more bumblebees foraging on uncropped naturally regenerated field margins than on cropped margins, though the value of naturally regenerated margins was found to be inconsistent from year to year and often depends on thistle species considered problematic weeds. Research indicates that margins sown with agricultural legume plants may degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and require re-sowing every few years.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"18\",\n    \"20\",\n    \"19\"\n  ]\n}"

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Successful rearing has been demonstrated for several species including B. terrestris, B. vagans, B. terricola, B. rufocinctus, B. ruderatus, and B. atratus. However, complete rearing failures were documented for B. fervidus, B. pensylvanicus, and the rusty-patched bumblebee, where queens laid eggs but larvae died before reaching adulthood. Key reproductive challenges include the finding that B. terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing. Environmental factors proved critical, with pollen diet quality significantly influencing reproductive success - queens fed freshly frozen pollen were larger and survived better than those fed dried, frozen pollen, and higher protein pollen types increased worker offspring production. Optimal conditions included an eight-hour light regime and specific hibernation requirements (4-5\u00b0C for 45 days, wet weight >0.6 g, hibernation \u22644 months). Reintroduction outcomes varied considerably across seven trials - while some colonies produced good numbers of new queens, others had very low or zero queen production. A major documented challenge was social parasitism by cuckoo bees, with variable rates ranging from 0-79% across trials, though landscape management strategies showed potential for reducing parasitism rates.",

One trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight.\\nThree trials have tried to rear North American bumblebees now declining or thought to be declining. Two induced spring queens of the half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola (attempted in all three trials) and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus (only attempted in one trial) to rear adults in captivity. All three trials tried to rear the yellow bumblebee B. fervidus and in all cases the queens laid eggs but the larvae died before becoming adults. One trial found the same pattern for the rusty-patched bumblebee and the American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus. One study reports rearing the large garden bumblebee B. ruderatus, a Biodiversity Action Plan species in the UK.\\nTwo trials have reported laboratory rearing of a pocket-making bumblebee, the Neotropical B. atratus.\\nThree replicated trials demonstrated that the pollen diet of captively reared bumblebees influences reproductive success. In one trial, buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen produced larger queens that survived better and produced larger colonies themselves than colonies fed on dried, frozen pollen. Two replicated trials demonstrated that B. terrestris workers can produce more offspring when fed types of pollen with a higher protein content.\\nTwo replicated experiments showed that an artificial light regime of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness, can reduce the time taken for artificially reared queen B. terrestris to lay eggs, relative to rearing in constant darkness.\\nWe have captured two replicated trials examining the effect of different artificial hibernation regimes in B. terrestris. One showed that hibernation of queens at 4-5\\u00b0C for 45 days enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates, but hibernated queens produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens. The second showed that queens should weigh more than 0.6 g (wet weight) and be hibernated for four months or less to have a good chance of surviving.\"\n}"

In two trials, good numbers of new queens were produced.\\nRates of social parasitism by cuckoo bees Bombus [Psithyrus] spp. in colonies released to the wild are variable. Two replicated trials in Canada and the UK found high rates (25-66% and 79% respectively). The UK trial showed that parasitism was reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, late, rather than early in the season. Five other replicated trials reported no social parasites. We have not found evidence to compare rates of parasitism in artificial nest boxes with the rate in natural nests.\\nTwo replicated trials examined the effects of supplementary feeding for bumblebee colonies placed in the field. One, in Canada, found supplementary feeding improved the reproductive success of captive-reared colonies, but did not reduce their parasite load. The other trial, in the USA, found supplementary feeding did not increase colony productivity.\\nOne small scale trial in Norway showed that colonies of the buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris prefer to forage more than 100 m from their nest sites.\"\n}"

Disease management studies show that the antibiotic fumagillin is not effective against Nosema bombi infection in managed colonies of western bumblebee Bombus occidentalis (Action 42). However, Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella in commercial bumblebee colonies can be controlled using the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Aizawai strain at a strength of 1 g Bt/litre of water (Action 42). Commercial honey bee Apis mellifera transport packages are at risk for spreading small hive beetle, though more than half the beetles were found to escape transport packages despite using mite-killing strips (Action 41). For solitary bee management used in commercial pollination, parasites and pathogens can be problematic in Megachilidae species, though various control methods have been developed for these species which readily nest in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards (Action 54). Rearing solitary bees on artificial diets presents risks, with one study finding high larval mortality in Osmia cornuta when reared on artificial pollen-based diets including honey bee-collected pollen (Action 54), while Megachile rotundata could be reared on artificial honey bee-collected pollen diets, though synthetic pollen substitutes either caused mortality or resulted in low pre-pupal weight (Action 54).",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple replicated trials across Europe shows that different sown floral mixes on agricultural land have varying effectiveness for wild bees. Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). These agricultural legume mixes also attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, particularly in the first year, though UK trials indicate they degrade in value and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18).\n\nNative wild flower seed mixes support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped fields, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially long-tongued species, with common long-tongued bumblebee species (Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum) strongly preferring perennial wildflower mixes over annual forage plant mixes (Action 19).\n\nPhacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) has been extensively studied, with ten trials finding substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on phacelia-rich patches, particularly bumblebees, with recorded species richness ranging from 8 to 35 species (Action 17). However, one replicated trial showed phacelia was not very attractive to wild bees in Greece (Action 17).\n\nWildflower strips generally show positive effects, with 50 out of 65 studies reporting benefits to invertebrates including wild bees (Actions 442, 3932). The evidence demonstrates that both agricultural legume mixes and native wildflower mixes can be effective, with different mixes showing varying attractiveness to different bee species and guilds.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Reducing pesticide or herbicide use generally has been studied, with one trial showing that responsible pesticide use on squash farms did not affect numbers of foraging bees (Action ID: 27). Altering the timing of insecticide applications has been investigated as a method to reduce impacts on beneficial insects (Action ID: 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels rather than preventative spraying has been tested, which can reduce the number of pesticide applications needed while maintaining crop protection (Action ID: 750). Leaving headlands in fields unsprayed (conservation headlands) has been shown to increase butterfly species richness and abundance compared to sprayed headlands, which may also benefit wild bees by providing pesticide-free foraging areas (Action ID: 3898). Buffer strips to reduce pesticide and nutrient run-off into margins and waterways have been evaluated, with one study finding greater abundance of moths in margins managed with pesticide restrictions (Action ID: 3894). Organic farming has been studied as an alternative approach, with three European and Canadian trials showing higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming compared to conventional farming (Action ID: 25).",

A replicated trial in blueberry fields over three years demonstrated that the estimated number of foraging Osmia bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without nest boxes. Research in California showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species can compete with native bees for nest boxes, with introduced species sometimes occupying boxes more frequently than native bees. However, a replicated controlled trial found that using a sticky barrier (Tanglefoot) to exclude European earwigs increased the use of boxes by native bees. The study suggested that management to exclude competitors and parasites can improve nesting success for native solitary bees.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

    "relevant_summary": "On UK farmland, both agricultural forage plants and native wildflower mixes in field margins attract bumblebees, with different advantages. Agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy or cropped field margins (action 18). Three replicated trials showed that agricultural forage plant mixes, particularly those containing legumes, can attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, especially in the first year after sowing. However, these agricultural legume margins degrade in their value to bumblebees over time and require re-sowing every few years to maintain effectiveness.\n\nNative wildflower seed mixes also effectively support bumblebees on UK farmland. Five replicated trials showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins or naturally regenerated uncropped margins (action 19). The perennial leguminous herbs in wildflower seed mixtures are particularly important forage sources for bumblebees, especially for long-tongued species. One trial demonstrated that common long-tongued bumblebee species (Bombus pascuorum and B. hortorum) strongly preferred plots of perennial wildflower seed mix over annual forage plant mixes.\n\nBoth approaches are more effective than conventional field margins, cropped areas, or naturally regenerated margins for supporting bumblebee populations. The choice between agricultural forage mixes and native wildflowers may depend on specific management goals, with agricultural mixes potentially offering greater initial attraction but requiring more frequent maintenance, while native wildflower mixes may provide more sustained benefits particularly for specialized bumblebee species.",

At the local patch scale, fourteen trials in Europe and North America found substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on perennial or annual sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (action 17). Ten trials monitoring bees on phacelia patches found substantial foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species richness ranging from 8-35 species (action 17). One replicated controlled trial in the UK showed planted perennial leguminous herbs were more attractive to bumblebees in arable-dominated landscapes (action 17).\n\nHowever, evidence measuring wider landscape-scale effects is more limited. Four replicated trials attempted to quantify the wider response of wild bee populations to planted flower patches by measuring reproductive success, numbers of nesting bees or foraging in the surrounding landscape (action 17). One trial in Nova Scotia showed planted patches significantly enhanced the reproductive success of blue orchard mason bees, while one trial in the Netherlands found no enhanced bee numbers in farmland 50-1,500 m away from flower patches (action 17).\n\nAt the landscape scale, one large replicated controlled trial showed that the average abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins was positively correlated with the number of pollen and nectar agri-environment agreements in a 10 km grid square (actions 21, 362). However, two replicated UK trials found that bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes at the wider landscape scale, with one study finding that agri-environment scheme prescriptions had local but not landscape-scale effects on bee numbers (action 24, action 700).",

Four replicated trials demonstrated enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees under European agri-environment schemes compared to conventionally-managed fields, including Swiss Ecological Compensation Areas, German organic arable farming, Dutch botanical and meadow bird agreements, and Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme. However, four other replicated trials found no enhancement in bee numbers or species richness under schemes including Dutch meadow bird agreements in wet grassland, Spanish steppe bird protection measures, and English 6m grass field margin strips. Two UK landscape-scale trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farms with agri-environment schemes. Planting dedicated floral resources showed more consistent results, with fourteen European and North American trials recording substantial wild bee foraging on sown flowering plants, particularly phacelia which attracted 8-35 bee species across eight trials. Field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes attracted significantly more bumblebees than grassy or cropped margins in four replicated European trials, though UK studies showed these margins require re-sowing every few years. Swiss species-rich grassland under agri-environment schemes attracted more nest-searching queen bumblebees, while restored UK and German grasslands had similar bee communities to ancient grasslands. The effectiveness appears to depend on specific scheme design, geographic location, and local habitat context.",

One of three replicated, site comparison studies in Germany\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that traditional hay meadows mown once/year in June or July had a higher abundance of heath fritillary adults and caterpillars than old, abandoned meadows. One study found that summer-grazed or mown grasslands had a higher abundance of farmland butterflies and burnet moths, but a lower abundance of woodland butterflies and burnet moths, than abandoned grasslands. The third study found that mown grasslands had a lower abundance of moths than unmown grasslands, but grazed grasslands had a similar abundance of moths to ungrazed grasslands. Two replicated, site comparison studies in China\\u00a0and Switzerland\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by grazing\\u00a0or cutting twice/year after mid-June\\u00a0had a lower abundance of marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars\\u00a0and adult butterflies\\u00a0than ungrazed margins and intercrops\\u00a0or sown wildflower strips. One replicated, site comparison study in Hungary\\u00a0found that semi-natural grasslands managed by either light grazing or mowing once/year in May or June had a higher abundance of butterflies than conventional wheat fields.\\nSurvival (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that marsh fritillary eggs had a similar survival rate in uncultivated, grazed meadows and cultivated, ungrazed field margins and intercrops, but the survival of caterpillars was higher in the grazed meadows.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (5 STUDIES)\\nUse (5 studies): Two replicated, site comparison studies in Austria\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0found that 14 species of moth\\u00a0preferred grazed pastures while 24 others avoided them, and three species of butterfly\\u00a0and ten nocturnal moths\\u00a0preferred mown meadows, while 19 nocturnal moth species avoided them. One replicated, site comparison study in Spain\\u00a0found that meadows managed by summer-grazing or hay-mowing were more likely to be occupied by grizzled skipper and painted lady than unmanaged meadows, but small pearl-bordered fritillary occurred less frequently in grazed meadows than in hay meadows or abandoned meadows. One replicated, site comparison study in Finland and Russia\\u00a0found that three of 37 butterfly species preferred meadows which were mown annually in July or August to cattle-grazed pasture, but the other 34 species showed no preference. One replicated, site comparison study in China\\u00a0found that uncultivated, grazed meadows were less likely to be occupied by marsh fritillary eggs and caterpillars than cultivated field margins and intercrops.\"\n}"

Reducing overall management intensity through delayed cutting and reduced agrochemical use showed mixed results - two of four replicated trials found enhanced numbers and diversity of wild bees, while two found no difference (action 22). Restoring species-rich grasslands was found to attract more nest-searching queen bumblebees compared to unmanaged grassland in one Scottish trial (action 8), with three small European studies showing restored grasslands had similar flower-visiting insect communities to ancient species-rich grasslands. Reducing grazing intensity by lowering stocking density was found to benefit butterflies and moths in 14 studies, with five of eight studies showing greater species richness and eight of eleven studies showing higher abundance (action 3959), though specific bee responses were not detailed. Maintaining rough grassland areas showed promising results, with one Scottish trial finding grassy field margins attracted nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins, managed/unmanaged grasslands or hedgerows (action 12). Combined approaches reducing multiple management intensities simultaneously were effective for butterflies and moths in 12 studies, with six of ten studies showing higher species richness and three of four studies showing higher abundance in low-input grasslands (action 3958).",

Nest box design is crucial - reed stem and wooden grooved-board designs produce more bees per nest than plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes, which are less productive due to parasitism and mould issues (action ID 47). The nesting material also matters, with reed stems or wood showing the highest production of red mason bees compared to other materials (action ID 80). Proximity to foraging resources is essential, with research indicating nest boxes must be within 150-600 m of foraging areas, as several European species have foraging ranges limited to this distance (actions 47, 80). The duration of provision also impacts success, with studies showing occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at sites (actions 47, 80). However, parasitism and predation significantly affect productivity, with mortality rates ranging from 2% to 56% across different studies, though some sites showed only 13% overall mortality with 2% successfully parasitized (action 47). Competition from introduced species can reduce occupancy by native bees, as European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species sometimes occupy boxes more frequently than native bees (action 47). Additionally, ant exclusion can improve offspring production, demonstrated in a study of the Australian bee Exonuera nigrescens (action 46). Occupancy rates vary considerably, with studies reporting 1-26% of available cavities occupied (action 80).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years.

High rates of parasitism and mortality have been documented, with mortality rates ranging from 2-56% across different studies. Parasitism rates reached 36% for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India, and overall mortality reached 56% for the same species. Nest boxes can facilitate the spread and establishment of introduced species, with European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species using boxes more commonly than native bees in California, USA. This led to the development of exclusion methods specifically targeting introduced earwigs. Certain nest box designs have proven problematic - plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould. Some nest box types, particularly surface wooden boxes commonly marketed for wildlife gardening, show very low uptake rates (0-2.5% in recent UK trials), questioning their effectiveness. For bumblebees, wooden surface or above ground boxes are not the most effective design and show consistently low occupancy rates. Additionally, soil-filled nest boxes for mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK were not occupied at all in a small trial, suggesting this approach is ineffective.",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

Social parasitism by cuckoo bees (Bombus [Psithyrus] spp.) is another critical factor, with studies showing highly variable parasitism rates from 25-79% in released colonies (Action ID 52). One UK trial demonstrated that social parasitism could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate rather than very high nectar and pollen availability, and by releasing them later rather than earlier in the season (Action ID 52). Supplementary feeding showed mixed results - one Canadian trial found it improved reproductive success of captive-reared colonies but did not reduce parasite load, while a US trial found no increase in colony productivity from supplementary feeding (Action ID 52). Captive rearing methods also mattered, with one trial finding that queens gradually decreased in weight over four years of artificial rearing (Action ID 50), and laboratory rearing showed variable success for different North American bumblebee species, with some species like B. fervidus laying eggs but experiencing larval mortality before reaching adulthood (Action ID 50).",
