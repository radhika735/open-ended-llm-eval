    "relevant_summary": "The most effective approaches for managing uncropped field margins for bumblebee conservation include sowing margins with flowering plant mixes, particularly those containing perennial leguminous plants, which attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated or grassy margins (Action 18). Agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes, especially those with legumes, show strong results in attracting bumblebees, though these mixes may degrade in value over time and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Native wildflower seed mixes also prove highly effective, supporting higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). These perennial wildflower mixes are particularly important for long-tongued bumblebee species. Naturally regenerated uncropped margins can provide benefits, with studies documenting more bumblebees foraging on these margins than on cropped margins, though their value is often based on thistle species considered pernicious weeds and their effectiveness varies year to year (Action 20). Providing rough grassland areas at field margins is important for bumblebee nesting habitat, with studies showing grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins or other habitat types (Action 12). While grassy strips alone show mixed results for bumblebee diversity, 6m wide grassy margins have demonstrated enhanced abundance of wild bees in some studies (Action 14). The evidence consistently shows that margins with flowering resources, whether from sown mixes or natural regeneration, are more valuable to bumblebees than purely grassy or cropped margins.",
