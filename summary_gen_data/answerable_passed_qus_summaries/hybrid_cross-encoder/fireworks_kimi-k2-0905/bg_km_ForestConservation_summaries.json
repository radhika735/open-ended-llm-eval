However, negative impacts include adverse effects on closed-forest bird species and ground nesters (action 318), with ten studies finding bird densities were the same or lower in burned sites compared to controls (action 318). For amphibians, eight of fourteen studies found no effect of prescribed forest fires on abundance or species numbers, while results were mixed across the remaining studies (action 877). Timing of burns appears to have minimal effect on outcomes, with one study finding burn season did not affect the impacts of prescribed burning (action 318), though another found northern brown bandicoot survival declined less in forests burned early versus late in the dry season (action 2416).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3877\",\n    \"877\",\n    \"318\",\n    \"317\",\n    \"2416\"\n  ]\n}"

Mechanical removal of understory vegetation (action ID 1256) showed mixed results - five studies found no effect on seedling emergence, survival, growth or frost damage, though one study found it increased seedling biomass, and another showed improved growth of black spruce when competing shrubs were removed. Ground cover methods include using plastic mats (action ID 1239), which one Canadian study found decreased cover of herbaceous plants and grasses, and alternative mulching techniques (action ID 1240), which one US study found increased total plant cover. Cutting or mowing vegetation (action ID 3713) has been studied primarily for reptile populations rather than tree establishment effects. Livestock grazing (action ID 3711) has shown some positive effects, with one study finding bog turtle reproductive success improved after grazing management. Mechanical removal of invasive plants (action ID 1228) showed varying results - one Hawaiian study found increased understory biomass after invasive grass removal, one Ghanaian study found increased tree seedling height after invasive weed removal, while other studies found no effects on native species growth or understory diversity.",

A review of programs in the USA and Canada (Action ID: 162) found that education alone was not sufficient to change behavior, although it served as a necessary catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. However, other studies showed more positive outcomes: awareness campaigns combined with other interventions increased amphibian pond creation in Estonia and the UK (Action ID: 831), and multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media, and discussions demonstrated effectiveness in multiple countries, with black howler monkey numbers increasing by 61-138% over 3-13 years in Belize (Action ID: 1571). Education programs targeting ranchers in South Africa successfully increased leopard density and reduced mortalities (Action ID: 2423). While specific evidence for forest conservation campaigns was notably absent from the documents searched, several studies found that awareness campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public annually or trained over 1,000 people at conservation events, and one UK study reported increased purchase of peat-free compost following awareness-raising activities about peatlands (Action ID: 1844). However, multiple actions (IDs: 1718, 3864, 1717, 3847, 3389) specifically noted the absence of evaluation studies, indicating a significant gap in evidence for the effectiveness of education and awareness programs for various conservation contexts.",
