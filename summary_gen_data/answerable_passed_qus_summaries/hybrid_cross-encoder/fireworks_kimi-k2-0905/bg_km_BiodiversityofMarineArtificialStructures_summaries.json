Both habitat lengths showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on factors like survey week, species group, and habitat characteristics, with three studies on short habitats and three studies on long habitats documenting variable responses (actions 3450, 3451). For fish populations, both habitat lengths demonstrated mixed effects on seahorse abundance depending on survey timing (actions 3450, 3451).

One study found transplanting oysters increased mobile invertebrate species richness, but two of three studies found no increase in fish species richness. Abundance outcomes varied with transplanting oysters showing mixed effects on combined macroalgae and invertebrate abundance, mobile invertebrate abundance, and fish abundance. Survival studies revealed varying results depending on species, site, and surface characteristics - oyster survival was higher when transplanted into grooves versus ridges, with survival rates varying by site. One study found transplanting oysters and coralline algae did not increase fish interaction time or bites taken from surfaces, though benthic fishes took more bites from oyster-only surfaces compared to combined algae and oyster surfaces.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 22 studies from various locations worldwide, several habitat creation methods have shown effectiveness for increasing species richness and diversity on intertidal artificial structures. Pit habitats (1-50 mm) appear to be the most consistently effective, with 8 out of 12 controlled studies showing increased macroalgae and invertebrate species richness or diversity on structure surfaces, though effects varied by site and species group. Rock pools also showed strong results, with 9 out of 12 controlled studies supporting higher species diversity and richness compared to structure surfaces without pools. Groove habitats (1-50 mm) demonstrated mixed effectiveness, with 3 out of 6 controlled studies showing increased species richness or diversity, though they did support different species communities and supported higher richness than some other habitat types like ridges. Combined approaches using grooves with small protrusions, ridges or ledges showed 6 out of 11 controlled studies increasing species diversity or richness. However, several methods showed limited effectiveness or even negative impacts. Short flexible habitats (1-50 mm) actually decreased species richness, while long flexible habitats (>50 mm) altered community composition without clear increases in richness. Small ridges or ledges (1-50 mm) generally supported lower species richness than grooves created between them. The effectiveness of all methods appeared to depend on various factors including habitat size and arrangement, shore level, site conditions, and the specific species groups being considered.",

For pit habitats, 16 studies examined community responses with mixed but generally positive effects: 4 out of 6 controlled studies found that pits altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition, with pits supporting species absent from surfaces without added habitats. Eight of 12 controlled studies found pits increased species richness/diversity, though some found mixed effects depending on site, size, or arrangement.\n\nFor hole habitats, only 3 studies examined community responses, but all found positive effects: creating holes altered macroalgae and invertebrate community composition and increased species diversity/richness on structure surfaces, with holes supporting species absent from control surfaces.\n\nPopulation responses varied for both habitat types. For pit habitats, 5 studies examined overall abundance with 2 finding increases, 1 finding decreases, and 2 finding no effect or mixed effects. For hole habitats, 2 studies examined abundance with neither finding increases in macroalgal or invertebrate abundance.\n\nBoth habitat types were found to be actively used by organisms - pit habitats were used by periwinkles, macroalgae, limpets, and increased fish foraging behavior, while hole habitats were used by sea slugs, urchins, and octopuses.",

For harvesting management, two studies were found examining restrictions on intertidal artificial structures - one in Italy and another in Gibraltar/Spain. These studies found that restricting human access did not increase limpet abundance but resulted in larger limpets with more balanced sex ratios compared to unrestricted structures. However, legal restrictions did not prevent people from harvesting invertebrates and fishes on and around structures. For maintenance activities and non-native species control, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of ceasing or altering these activities on intertidal artificial structures, indicating a complete absence of evidence for these management approaches.",
