    "relevant_summary": "Based on 15 studies investigating peatland restoration after forestry use, cutting trees alone and cutting trees with rewetting show different effectiveness for vegetation recovery. Tree cutting alone (documented in 4 studies) consistently increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, and in some cases increased total plant species richness. However, effects on moss cover were mixed, with one study showing decreased Sphagnum moss cover over three years. In contrast, the combined approach of cutting trees and rewetting (documented in 11 studies) showed more comprehensive restoration outcomes: it increased wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover, herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, ground vegetation height, and total plant species richness. The combined intervention also reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses and tall tree abundance, while tree cutting alone did not address tree regeneration. Both approaches increased plant species richness in rich fens, but rewetting studies demonstrate that raising water levels is particularly effective for restoring peatland-characteristic vegetation.",

The evidence comes from studies across bogs, fens, and general peatlands in Europe and North America.",

Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting.

Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain.

Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Complete exclusion of livestock from degraded peatlands typically has no effect on cover of key herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, with five of five studies finding no effect on cottongrass cover (Action ID: 1734). Similarly, excluding livestock had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover in five replicated studies, although responses varied between species and sites. For shrub cover, excluding livestock had mixed results - four studies found no effect on heather or heathland communities, while three studies found increased shrub cover after livestock exclusion. Vegetation biomass responses to exclusion were mixed, with one study finding increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass, but no effect on grass-like herb biomass. In contrast, reduced grazing intensity consistently showed more positive vegetation responses. One replicated, paired, controlled study found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower (Action ID: 1735). Cottongrass cover showed either greater cover where grazing intensity was lower or was unaffected by grazing intensity changes.",

Single cuts were less effective, typically showing no effect on fen-characteristic plants or bryophytes.\n\nGrazing showed more mixed results based on four studies in fens and fen meadows. While it altered plant community composition compared to mowing and increased cover of some herbs like cottongrasses and sedges, it did not consistently increase cover of fen-characteristic plants or mosses, with one study even reporting reduced Sphagnum moss cover. Plant species richness responses were inconsistent, with grazed meadows containing fewer fen-characteristic species and fewer total plant species than mown meadows in comparative studies.",
