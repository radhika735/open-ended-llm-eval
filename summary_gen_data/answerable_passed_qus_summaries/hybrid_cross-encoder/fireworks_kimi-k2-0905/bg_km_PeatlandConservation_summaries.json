    "relevant_summary": "Based on 15 studies investigating peatland restoration after forestry use, cutting trees alone and cutting trees with rewetting show different effectiveness for vegetation recovery. Tree cutting alone (documented in 4 studies) consistently increased herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, and in some cases increased total plant species richness. However, effects on moss cover were mixed, with one study showing decreased Sphagnum moss cover over three years. In contrast, the combined approach of cutting trees and rewetting (documented in 11 studies) showed more comprehensive restoration outcomes: it increased wetland-characteristic plants, Sphagnum moss cover, herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, ground vegetation height, and total plant species richness. The combined intervention also reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses and tall tree abundance, while tree cutting alone did not address tree regeneration. Both approaches increased plant species richness in rich fens, but rewetting studies demonstrate that raising water levels is particularly effective for restoring peatland-characteristic vegetation.",

The evidence comes from studies across bogs, fens, and general peatlands in Europe and North America.",

Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting.

Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

Complete exclusion of livestock from degraded peatlands typically has no effect on cover of key herb groups like cottongrasses and sedges, with five of five studies finding no effect on cottongrass cover (Action ID: 1734). Similarly, excluding livestock had no effect on Sphagnum moss cover in five replicated studies, although responses varied between species and sites. For shrub cover, excluding livestock had mixed results - four studies found no effect on heather or heathland communities, while three studies found increased shrub cover after livestock exclusion. Vegetation biomass responses to exclusion were mixed, with one study finding increased total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass, but no effect on grass-like herb biomass. In contrast, reduced grazing intensity consistently showed more positive vegetation responses. One replicated, paired, controlled study found that total vegetation and shrub cover were greater where grazing intensity was lower, and vegetation biomass was higher where grazing intensity was lower (Action ID: 1735). Cottongrass cover showed either greater cover where grazing intensity was lower or was unaffected by grazing intensity changes.",

Single cuts were less effective, typically showing no effect on fen-characteristic plants or bryophytes.\n\nGrazing showed more mixed results based on four studies in fens and fen meadows. While it altered plant community composition compared to mowing and increased cover of some herbs like cottongrasses and sedges, it did not consistently increase cover of fen-characteristic plants or mosses, with one study even reporting reduced Sphagnum moss cover.

Fifteen studies were in bogs (two\\u00a0being restored as fens). Fifteen studies were in fens or fen meadows\\u00a0(two\\u00a0were naturally forested). Six studies were in general or unspecified peatlands. Some studies were based on the same experimental set-up or sites as each other: two studies in Germany, three studies in Sweden, two studies in west Finland\\u00a0and two studies in south Finland.\\nPlant community composition (13 studies):\\u00a0Six before-and-after studies (four also replicated) in peatlands in Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Poland\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported changes in the overall plant community composition following rewetting. Typically, drier grassland communities were replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities.\\u00a0One replicated, paired, controlled study in a bog in the Czech Republic\\u00a0found that rewetted plots developed a different plant community to drained plots. Three site comparison studies in Finland\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetted peatlands contained a different plant community to natural peatlands. Three replicated studies in peatlands in the UK\\u00a0and fens in Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically had no effect, or insignificant effects, on the plant community.\\nCharacteristic plants (11 studies): Five studies (including one replicated site comparison) in peatlands in Canada, the UK, China\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased the abundance of wetland- or peatland-characteristic plants. Two replicated site comparison studies in fens or fen meadows in central Europe\\u00a0found that rewetting reduced the number of fen-characteristic plant species. Two studies (one replicated, paired, controlled, before-and-after) in fens in Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic plants.\\u00a0Two before-and-after studies in fens in the USA\\u00a0and New Zealand\\u00a0reported that upland plant cover decreased following rewetting.\\u00a0\\nMoss cover (19 studies):\\u00a0Twelve studies (five replicated, two also paired and controlled) in the UK, Ireland, Germany,\\u00a0Sweden, Latvia, Canada\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs, fens or other peatlands (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased Sphagnum moss cover or abundance. Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs. These studies were in bogs, fens or other peatlands in the UK, Finland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Latvia, Poland, Canada\\u00a0and Spain. Specifically, rewetting increased other/total sedge cover in 13 of 15 studies, increased cottongrass cover in eight of nine studies, and increased reed/rush cover in five of seven studies. Three\\u00a0of four before-and-after studies in peatlands in the UK and Sweden reported that rewetting reduced purple moor grass cover; the other study\\u00a0reported no effect. One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover. Two site comparison studies in Europe\\u00a0reported greater herb cover in rewetted than natural peatlands (overall\\u00a0and sedges/rushes, but not forbs).\\nTree/shrub cover (13 studies):\\u00a0Ten\\u00a0studies (including two paired and controlled) in peatlands in Finland, the UK,\\u00a0Germany, Latvia\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting typically reduced (seven studies)\\u00a0or had no effect (six studies)\\u00a0on tree and/or shrub cover. Two before-and-after studies in fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased tree/shrub cover. One before-and-after study in a bog in the UK\\u00a0reported mixed effects of rewetting on different tree/shrub species.\\nOverall vegetation cover (4 studies): Of four before-and-after studies (three also controlled) that examined the effect of rewetting on overall vegetation cover, two in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0reported that rewetting increased it. One study in a fen in New Zealand\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced vegetation cover.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland. One study in fen meadows in the Netherlands\\u00a0found scale-dependent effects. One paired, controlled, before-and-after study in a peatland in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced plant diversity.

    "relevant_summary": "The documented benefits and harms of soil amendments and covers for newly planted peatland vegetation show mixed results depending on the material used. Adding fresh peat as a soil amendment can increase cover of some sown plant species compared to the original bog surface, though this benefit may be cancelled by fertilization for certain species (Action 1837). Inorganic fertilizer applications show mixed effects: they can increase survival of some planted tree species while reducing survival of others, typically increase growth of planted mosses, herbs, and trees, and may increase vegetation cover (Action 1826). However, fertilizers may have no effect on some species or in certain conditions. Phosphorus-based fertilizers appear most effective, showing increased vegetation biomass, growth rates, and species richness (Action 1812, 1827).\n\nFor protective covers, plastic mesh shading shows benefits including increased survival of planted mosses and greater cover of native plants, forbs, and Sphagnum moss (Action 1829, 1814). Transparent plastic sheets or shading mesh can enhance Sphagnum moss growth, though effects vary by species and location. Covering planted areas with plastic mesh typically results in taller but thinner seedling growth compared to unshaded conditions. Organic mulch applications like straw show limited benefits, with no significant effects on fen-characteristic plant cover or Sphagnum moss cover, though they may increase the number of characteristic plant species present (Action 1813). The effectiveness of covers depends on material type - fleece and fiber mats show mixed effects on germination depending on plant species, while plastic mesh consistently outperforms transparent plastic sheets for promoting Sphagnum moss shoots.",

    "relevant_summary": "For restoring peatland vegetation on sites previously used for commercial forest plantations, several interventions are available based on evidence from multiple studies. The primary approach involves cutting or removing forest plantations combined with rewetting the peat (Action ID 1732). This combined intervention has been shown to increase cover of wetland-characteristic plants and Sphagnum moss in some cases, increase herb cover including cottongrasses and sedges, and increase plant species richness in certain contexts. Tree removal alone (Action ID 1731) can increase cover of some herb species like cottongrasses and sedges while reducing cover of forest-characteristic mosses. For hydrological restoration, filling or blocking drainage ditches (Action ID 1805) allows colonization by herbs and bryophytes, with vegetation cover potentially reaching natural levels within 2-3 years. Surface disturbance techniques (Action ID 1811) can encourage colonization by wetland-characteristic plant species. After planting desired species, covering the peatland with materials like plastic mesh (Action ID 1829) can increase survival and cover of planted mosses. Multiple combined interventions (Action ID 1803) have successfully increased moss cover, herb cover, and overall vegetation cover in restoration projects. The choice of intervention should consider site-specific conditions and may require combining several approaches for optimal results.",

Mowing increased total moss or bryophyte cover in four studies from Belgium, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Eight studies in fens and fen meadows across the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland found that mowing increased plant species richness compared to no mowing or grazing. Mowing reduced cover of problematic herbs including bindweed, reeds, sedges, purple moor grass and grass-like plants overall, and reduced shrub cover in some cases.\n\nMowing trade-offs: Some studies found mixed effects on vegetation biomass and structure. Three studies reported that single mowing events had no effect on vegetation height, and two studies found single mows had no effect on bryophyte cover or plant species richness.\n\nGrazing benefits: Two UK studies reported that grazing with cattle or horses increased cover of some herb groups (cottongrasses, sedges or all grass-like plants) and reduced purple moor grass cover in some cases. One UK study found that plant species richness increased after grazing was reinstated. Grazing reduced shrub cover in one UK study.\n\nGrazing trade-offs: One replicated, paired, site comparison study in Germany found that grazed fen meadows contained fewer fen-characteristic plant species and fewer plant species overall than mown meadows. The overall plant community composition differed between grazed and mown fen meadows. Grazing reduced Sphagnum moss cover in one UK study and typically had no effect on shrub cover in another UK study.

When peatland surfaces are disturbed without planting, evidence shows that soil disturbance affects plant community development over 2-3 years, with disturbed plots developing greater cover of weedy species from the seed bank, and wetland-characteristic plant species colonizing disturbed areas, though peat-forming species may not colonize. The effectiveness varies by site conditions and the specific type of peatland.",
