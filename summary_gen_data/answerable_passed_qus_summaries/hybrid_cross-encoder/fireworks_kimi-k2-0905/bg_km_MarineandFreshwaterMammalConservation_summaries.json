    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents shows multiple interventions directly managing individual mammals to boost threatened populations. Translocation of wild mammals to re-establish or boost populations in their native range was evaluated in 64 studies, with 14 studies finding increased populations following translocation, and 20 studies documenting survival for periods ranging from two months to at least 25 years (Action ID 2397). Release of captive-bred mammals was evaluated in 31 studies, with five studies finding increased populations following release, and 11 studies documenting survival periods ranging from three months to over seven years (Action ID 2476). For marine mammals specifically, four studies evaluated translocation of Hawaiian monk seals, finding 50-83% survival rates for translocated pups and that over 25% of translocated seals reproduced (Action ID 2930). Rehabilitation and release of individual marine mammals showed variable success, with 21 studies finding 10-100% survival during monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action ID 2925). Rescue and release of stranded marine mammals was evaluated in 11 studies, with seven studies finding 17-100% survival during monitoring periods of three weeks to three years (Action ID 2924). For terrestrial mammals, 13 studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured, sick, or weak individuals, with 10 studies documenting survival ranging from two weeks to seven years post-release (Action ID 2352). Release of mammals to predator-free islands was evaluated in six studies, with three studies documenting survival of more than one year and three studies finding successful breeding populations established (Action ID 2464).",

A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years.

These devices reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in multiple studies across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, with nine studies showing fewer collisions and entanglements of humpback whales, harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans. Acoustically reflective fishing gear materials also showed effectiveness, with two of three controlled studies demonstrating fewer harbour porpoise entanglements in the North Sea and other regions. Adding lights to fishing gear has shown mixed results for marine mammals, with limited evidence specific to cetaceans. For fishing gear modifications, fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets primarily targets fish bycatch reduction rather than cetacean bycatch, while topless trawls showed some effectiveness for reducing unwanted fish catches. Using stiffened materials in fishing nets did not reduce Franciscana dolphin entanglements in the South Atlantic Ocean. The evidence strongly supports acoustic deterrent devices as the primary intervention, with deployment across multiple Atlantic and North Sea fisheries demonstrating consistent reductions in cetacean bycatch.",

Additionally, most of these released captive-reared Antillean manatees were found to reproduce successfully. However, some hand-reared West Indian manatee calves either died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived in the wild only with supplemental feeding. For captive-bred manatees, studies in Florida and Brazil found that two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention. Overall survival rates vary, with hand-reared individuals showing better outcomes than captive-bred ones, and long-term survival and reproduction being documented for some released individuals.",

'Soft start' procedures can deter marine mammals, with three studies showing varying responses including cetaceans avoiding vessels during seismic airgun operations in UK waters, short-finned pilot whales initially moving away but remaining within 900 m in the South Atlantic, and migrating humpback whales slowing their speed but not significantly altering course in the South Pacific (Action ID 2897).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 33 studies primarily conducted in coastal waters, using acoustic devices on fishing gear provides significant benefits for porpoise conservation. The most substantial benefit is the reduction in porpoise entanglements, with nine controlled studies finding fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises when acoustic devices were used on cod traps or fishing nets in the North Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, South Atlantic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, Black Sea, and South Pacific Ocean (Action ID: 2808). However, three studies found mixed results where acoustic devices reduced entanglements of some species but not others.\n\nBehavioural evidence shows that harbour porpoises and other marine mammals generally respond to acoustic deterrents by maintaining greater distances from fishing gear. Twelve of sixteen controlled studies found that harbour porpoises, common bottlenose dolphins, tuxuci dolphins, finless porpoises and seals approached nets less closely, had fewer encounters with nets, or reduced their activity in surrounding areas when acoustic devices were deployed (Action ID: 2808).\n\nPotential harms identified include habitat exclusion effects, where one controlled study in the Bay of Fundy found that while acoustic devices on moorings initially reduced harbour porpoise echolocation activity, porpoises actually increased their probability of approaching within 125m of the device over 10-11 days, suggesting potential habituation (Action ID: 2816). Additionally, two studies found that acoustic devices on vessels did not reduce predation by Risso's dolphins on squid catches and had limited effects on dolphin behaviour (Action ID: 2815).\n\nThe evidence indicates that while acoustic devices are generally effective at reducing porpoise bycatch and entanglements, their effectiveness can vary by location, species, and potentially decrease over time due to habituation.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence from action documents reveals several trade-offs when using acoustic devices for marine mammal conservation. Studies show that acoustic devices can deter marine mammals from specific areas, which is both their intended purpose and presents a trade-off - while this reduces immediate threats like noise exposure (Action ID: 2896) and fishing gear entanglements, it also results in habitat displacement, with three studies showing reduced harbour porpoise activity within 1-18 km ranges and minke whales swimming away from device locations. The devices show mixed effectiveness across applications - they successfully reduce marine mammal predation on aquaculture systems in some cases but fail in others, with no effect on common bottlenose dolphins at fin-fish farms (Action ID: 2775). Fishing gear applications demonstrate a trade-off between protection effectiveness, where 12 of 16 controlled studies show reduced mammal interactions and 9 of 14 studies show fewer entanglements, but 4 studies found no significant behavioral effects on certain species like bottlenose dolphins and dugongs (Action ID: 2808). Vessel-based and mooring applications show behavioral changes that may interfere with natural migration patterns, with one study revealing decreased whale distances from fishing vessels during hauls but decreasing effectiveness after initial exposure, and another showing harbor porpoise behavior changed from avoidance to approach over 10-11 days of exposure (Action IDs: 2815, 2816). These findings indicate that while acoustic devices can be effective conservation tools in specific contexts, their effectiveness varies by species and location, may decrease over time due to habituation, and can cause unintended habitat displacement that may affect feeding, breeding, and migration behaviors.",
