    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from action documents shows multiple interventions directly managing individual mammals to boost threatened populations. Translocation of wild mammals to re-establish or boost populations in their native range was evaluated in 64 studies, with 14 studies finding increased populations following translocation, and 20 studies documenting survival for periods ranging from two months to at least 25 years (Action ID 2397). Release of captive-bred mammals was evaluated in 31 studies, with five studies finding increased populations following release, and 11 studies documenting survival periods ranging from three months to over seven years (Action ID 2476). For marine mammals specifically, four studies evaluated translocation of Hawaiian monk seals, finding 50-83% survival rates for translocated pups and that over 25% of translocated seals reproduced (Action ID 2930). Rehabilitation and release of individual marine mammals showed variable success, with 21 studies finding 10-100% survival during monitoring periods ranging from three days to five years (Action ID 2925). Rescue and release of stranded marine mammals was evaluated in 11 studies, with seven studies finding 17-100% survival during monitoring periods of three weeks to three years (Action ID 2924). For terrestrial mammals, 13 studies evaluated rehabilitation of injured, sick, or weak individuals, with 10 studies documenting survival ranging from two weeks to seven years post-release (Action ID 2352). Release of mammals to predator-free islands was evaluated in six studies, with three studies documenting survival of more than one year and three studies finding successful breeding populations established (Action ID 2464).",

A review in Australia\\u00a0found that over half of translocations, for which the outcome could be determined, were classified as successful. Two of three studies (one replicated) and one review in Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands\\u00a0and the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that following release of wild-caught translocated and captive-bred animals, European otters\\u00a0and common dormice\\u00a0survived three months to seven years.

These devices reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in multiple studies across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, with nine studies showing fewer collisions and entanglements of humpback whales, harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans. Acoustically reflective fishing gear materials also showed effectiveness, with two of three controlled studies demonstrating fewer harbour porpoise entanglements in the North Sea and other regions. Adding lights to fishing gear has shown mixed results for marine mammals, with limited evidence specific to cetaceans. For fishing gear modifications, fitting size-sorting escape grids to trawl nets primarily targets fish bycatch reduction rather than cetacean bycatch, while topless trawls showed some effectiveness for reducing unwanted fish catches. Using stiffened materials in fishing nets did not reduce Franciscana dolphin entanglements in the South Atlantic Ocean. The evidence strongly supports acoustic deterrent devices as the primary intervention, with deployment across multiple Atlantic and North Sea fisheries demonstrating consistent reductions in cetacean bycatch.",

Additionally, most of these released captive-reared Antillean manatees were found to reproduce successfully. However, some hand-reared West Indian manatee calves either died before or after release, had to be returned to captivity after release, or survived in the wild only with supplemental feeding. For captive-bred manatees, studies in Florida and Brazil found that two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released into the wild survived for at least one year without further intervention. Overall survival rates vary, with hand-reared individuals showing better outcomes than captive-bred ones, and long-term survival and reproduction being documented for some released individuals.",

'Soft start' procedures can deter marine mammals, with three studies showing varying responses including cetaceans avoiding vessels during seismic airgun operations in UK waters, short-finned pilot whales initially moving away but remaining within 900 m in the South Atlantic, and migrating humpback whales slowing their speed but not significantly altering course in the South Pacific (Action ID 2897).
