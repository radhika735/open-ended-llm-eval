    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, only probiotic bacterium treatment has been studied for combating white-nose syndrome in bats. Two randomized, controlled studies (action 2008) found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium showed some positive effects: survival increased for free-flying bats in one study and within cages in a laboratory when treated at the time of infection, though not for caged bats in mines. Additionally, bats treated at the time of infection showed reduced disease symptoms, while those treated 21 days prior to infection experienced worse symptoms. No studies have been found to evaluate the effectiveness of culling infected bats (action 1012), vaccinating bats against the pathogen (action 1011), treating hibernacula environments (action 2007), or decontaminating clothing and equipment to reduce pathogen spread (action 2006).",
