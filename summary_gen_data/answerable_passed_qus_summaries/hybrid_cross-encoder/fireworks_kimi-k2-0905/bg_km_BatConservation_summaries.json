One study found that ringing bells in lychee trees deterred most Madagascan flying foxes. Diversionary feeding has shown success with other mammals, with studies demonstrating that providing alternative food sources reduced nuisance behavior by black bears in the USA. Conditioned taste aversion techniques, where foodstuffs are laced with substances that induce illness, led to food avoidance by coyotes and black bears in the USA. Other non-lethal approaches include providing training to wildlife control operators on least harmful ways of removing bats from their roosts, educating farmers and communities to reduce indiscriminate culling, carrying out disease surveillance to prevent spread to humans, and providing alternative bat boxes and roost improvements.",

Using ultraviolet filters on lights has also demonstrated benefits, with a UK study showing higher soprano pipistrelle activity under ultraviolet filtered lights compared to unfiltered lights.
