Shelterwood harvesting specifically showed variable results: three studies found it resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action ID: 851). Leave-tree harvesting, where a low density of trees is left during harvest, did not result in higher salamander abundance than clearcutting (Action ID: 846).
