    "relevant_summary": "Several effective actions can mitigate road impacts on amphibian populations. Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is one of the most studied approaches, with 15 of 24 studies finding they were used by amphibians, with usage rates of 15-85% or by 3-15 species. Six of seven studies found that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, particularly when barrier fencing was also installed. Barrier fencing along roads was found to decrease amphibian road deaths in seven of eight studies, provided that fence length and material were effective. Roads can be closed during seasonal amphibian migrations, with studies in Germany finding that this protected large numbers of amphibians from death during breeding migrations. Humans can assist migrating amphibians across roads, with studies in Germany, the UK and Italy finding that patrols moved large numbers of amphibians (ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million annually), though some studies found that despite assistance, 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years. Restoring habitat connectivity by raising roads on viaducts significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians in an Italian study. Warning signage for motorists has been used, though one UK study found that despite signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads.",
