    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from grassland restoration studies, both soil disturbance and topsoil removal before seeding have distinct outcomes for vegetation establishment and community development. Soil disturbance through methods like rotovating or harrowing before seeding typically increases plant emergence (4 out of 5 studies found increased emergence) and can increase forb cover and plant/seedling species richness, though results vary by study. In contrast, topsoil or turf removal before seeding shows stronger positive effects on plant community composition, particularly in creating plant communities more similar to intact grasslands and increasing sown/planted species richness and survival. A replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK directly compared these methods and found that removing turf before sowing increased both grass and forb species richness in most cases compared to disturbing the soil (rotovating) before sowing. Additionally, two studies found that removing topsoil before planting increased the survival of planted species compared to disturbance methods. While both approaches can be effective, topsoil removal appears to create more favorable conditions for establishing diverse, target grassland communities and improving plant survival rates.",

Adding charcoal before seeding showed minimal effects - a Netherlands study found no change in overall plant biomass or grass cover, but legume cover increased while other forb cover remained unchanged [action 3422]. Sulphur application before seeding had variable outcomes: one UK study found reduced plant species richness and overall vegetation cover, though low sulphur amounts increased cover of some sown species [action 3428]. A separate USA study found sulphur had no effect on native plant species numbers [action 3428]. When sulphur was added alongside seeding, studies showed mixed effects on heather cover in the UK, though one study found improved seedling survival [action 1710].

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from European studies shows that both mowing and livestock grazing after seeding can enhance sown species, but with different effects. Mowing after seeding increased sown species richness (Action 3419), with one UK study showing increased richness when cut vegetation was removed annually. Mowing also increased the abundance of sown forb species, with German studies showing enhanced abundance for five of seven sown forb species when mown more frequently. In contrast, grazing with livestock after seeding showed mixed results for sown species enhancement (Action 3423). A UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing increased sown species richness compared to sheep grazing, but another study found cattle grazing reduced sown species cover compared to sheep grazing. One controlled study in the UK found that cutting vegetation yearly after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock after sowing. The timing and intensity of both management approaches appear important for successful establishment of sown species.",

Six of seven studies found that ground preparation before tree planting increased survival and growth (Action 1263). However, different planting or seeding methods showed mixed results, with four studies finding no effect on seedling survival and size (Action 1264). Mechanical thinning before or after planting increased survival and size of planted trees in five of six studies (Action 1261). Adding inorganic fertilizer showed mixed effects, with some studies finding increased survival for two tree species while others found no effect or reduced survival for other species (Action 1826). Adding root-associated fungi to plants before planting generally had no significant effect on survival in most cases (Action 1841). For seeding methods, drill seeding versus hand seeding showed mixed results, with some studies finding no difference in species richness while others found increased abundance of certain grass species (Action 3410). Hydroseeding (spraying seed slurry) showed mixed effects on plant diversity and abundance (Action 3412). Irrigation before or after seeding showed mixed effects, with some studies finding increased vegetation cover while others found no effect on native species richness or abundance (Action 3430). Soil disturbance before planting in brackish/saline wetlands showed no significant effect on mangrove propagule survival or height (Action 3295).",

The studies focused on three main parasitic plant species: yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), European yellow rattle, and marsh lousewort. Five of the six studies found that sowing parasitic plant seeds increased plant species richness and/or diversity, while one UK study found no change in plant species richness. In the UK, sowing yellow rattle seeds led to a decrease in total plant biomass in three of four studies, and helped other sown target meadow species to colonize with more plant species found when yellow rattle was present. In Switzerland, sowing European yellow rattle seeds led to a decrease in grass cover but did not alter the cover of forbs. In Belgium, sowing marsh lousewort seeds increased the abundance of six target plant species. These results demonstrate that while parasitic plant sowing generally shows positive effects on species richness across European countries, the specific impacts on vegetation abundance and structure vary by country and the particular parasitic species used.",
