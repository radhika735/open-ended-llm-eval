One controlled, replicated, before-and-after study in Indonesia found that areas using noise deterrents along with tree nets experienced reduced crop raiding by orangutans (action 1449). Additionally, one study in the Democratic Republic of Congo found that chasing gorillas with random noise resulted in gorillas returning from plantations to areas near protected forest (action 1449). However, for bright lights specifically used to chase primates, no evidence was found for effects on primate populations or crop-raiding deterrence (action 1450), meaning no studies have directly and quantitatively tested this action. The evidence base for loud noises also extends beyond primates - five of six studies across the USA, Namibia, Kenya and India found that loud noises activated when animals were nearby reduced or partially reduced crop damage by various mammals (action 2460).",

Community-based hunting control measures (1482) showed positive results: a site comparison in Democratic Republic of Congo found community control more effective at reducing illegal bushmeat hunting than national park management, a before-and-after study in Cameroon reported no gorilla poaching incidents for three years following community control implementation, and a site comparison in Nigeria found higher gorilla and chimpanzee numbers in areas managed by community conservation organizations. However, numerous proposed mitigation strategies currently lack evidence of effectiveness, including using forest set-asides (1497), incorporating forested corridors or buffers (1495), road closure timing (1496), providing domestic meat to loggers (1501), forest certification schemes (1500), and road block inspections for illegal bushmeat (1470).",

However, species-specific responses vary - mountain brushtail possums and common ringtail possums used rope bridges, while koalas and squirrel gliders did not.\n\nNo evidence was found for the effects of green bridges (overpasses) specifically on primate populations, as no studies have directly tested this intervention.",

One study found a temporary increased in prairie vole abundance.

When translocating wild primates from development sites to natural habitat, research showed that the majority of orangutans survived in Malaysia, alongside other interventions. Three studies in Tanzania, French Guiana, and Madagascar found that a majority of primates survived for 5-30 months following translocation, though one French Guiana study found only a minority survived for at least 18 months. In India, rhesus monkeys remained at release sites following translocation from development sites.\n\nFor relocating 'problem' animals, studies showed positive outcomes: translocated 'problem' rhesus monkeys in India survived and remained at release sites for at least four years alongside other interventions. In Kenya, most crop-raiding olive baboons translocated from farmland survived for 16 years with similar survival rates to non-translocated populations. A study across Republic of Congo and Gabon found that 84% of 'problem' western lowland gorillas survived for at least four years after relocation.\n\nTranslocation from abundant populations to uninhabited areas showed promise, with one study in Belize finding that the majority of black howler monkeys survived for at least 10 months after translocation. However, no evidence was found for the effectiveness of translocation specifically to reduce primate predation by other primate species or non-primate species.",
