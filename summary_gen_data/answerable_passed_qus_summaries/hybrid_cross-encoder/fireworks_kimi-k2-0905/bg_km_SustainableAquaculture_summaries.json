Cleaner wrasse fish can be used as natural control agents against sea lice, with one study finding they were as effective as chemical treatments, though another study found them ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Probiotics and immunostimulants in feed can increase survival when salmon are exposed to disease-causing bacteria, while vaccination programs have shown higher survival rates against diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia. Fallowing systems, where cages are left empty between production cycles, have shown mixed results with one study recording lower lice numbers in Scotland but another finding no difference in amoebic gill disease mortality in Australia. Freshwater bathing can reduce amoebae on salmon gills for up to 10 days, though one study found similar levels between treated and untreated salmon. Breeding programs for disease resistance traits have increased survival levels when salmon families were bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis. Additionally, dietary changes including plant-based proteins can reduce lice infection by 28%, and beta-glucans can provide an additional 28% reduction in lice infection levels.",

Integrated aquaculture systems (Action 932) have shown effectiveness where blue mussels can absorb waste from salmon farms, and scallops and algae placed adjacent to fish farms demonstrate enhanced growth. For sludge management specifically, drying sludge in beds (Action 943) has been shown in replicated trials in Canada to effectively remove phosphorus from freshwater fish farm sludge. Other potential approaches include establishing aquaculture facilities specifically to extract nutrients from run-offs (Action 2883), switching to land-based aquaculture systems (Action 3583) which may provide better waste containment, and cleaning wastewater before environmental release (Action 3142). Additional management strategies include minimizing food waste at aquaculture systems (Action 2744), modifying aquaculture practices to reduce pollution (Action 3172), and introducing water quality regulations for aquaculture systems (Action 2876). Using species from multiple trophic levels in aquaculture systems (Action 2195) can also potentially help manage waste through natural biological processes.",

Specific biofouling management actions include preventing biofouling organism attachment and removing biofouling organisms, though no studies have evaluated their effectiveness yet (Action IDs: 2162, 2163).
