Cleaner wrasse fish can be used as natural control agents against sea lice, with one study finding they were as effective as chemical treatments, though another study found them ineffective at preventing lice outbreaks. Probiotics and immunostimulants in feed can increase survival when salmon are exposed to disease-causing bacteria, while vaccination programs have shown higher survival rates against diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia. Fallowing systems, where cages are left empty between production cycles, have shown mixed results with one study recording lower lice numbers in Scotland but another finding no difference in amoebic gill disease mortality in Australia. Freshwater bathing can reduce amoebae on salmon gills for up to 10 days, though one study found similar levels between treated and untreated salmon. Breeding programs for disease resistance traits have increased survival levels when salmon families were bred for high resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis. Additionally, dietary changes including plant-based proteins can reduce lice infection by 28%, and beta-glucans can provide an additional 28% reduction in lice infection levels.",
