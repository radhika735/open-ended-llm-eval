    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from the action documents, here is a comparison of herbicide alone, cutting alone, and combination approaches for controlling bracken in UK heathlands:\n\n**Herbicide alone**: Three randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that herbicide application reduced bracken biomass or cover. One controlled, before-and-after trial in the UK found that herbicide increased heather seedlings, but two other randomized, controlled studies found herbicide did not increase heather cover. One study found herbicide increased plant species richness, while another found no effect on species richness or diversity.\n\n**Cutting alone**: One randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting reduced bracken cover or biomass. One randomized, replicated, controlled study found cutting increased species richness, while another found no change in species richness but increased diversity. Results on heather recovery were mixed, with one study showing increased heather cover/biomass but two others finding no increase in heather cover or seedlings.\n\n**Combination of cutting and herbicide**: Three randomized, controlled studies (including one before-and-after trial) in the UK and Norway found that cutting combined with herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover. One study found this combination increased heather cover, while another found no effect on heather biomass. One replicated, randomized, controlled study found that cutting followed by herbicide increased plant species richness compared to herbicide followed by cutting.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while all three approaches can reduce bracken abundance, results vary regarding recovery of native heathland vegetation, with combination treatments showing some benefits over single methods in certain contexts.",

In the USA, studies showed more variable results, with one study finding decreased woody plant cover, another showing mixed effects on shrub cover, and some finding no difference in forb cover. In Finland, studies found that fencing did not alter cover of grass species or abundance of herb species.

This approach also resulted in decreased grass cover while allowing woody plant species cover to increase.\n\n**Seed Sowing**: Sowing seeds of shrubland species has proven effective, with five of six studies showing increased shrub cover and seedling abundance. This method also helped restore community composition similar to undisturbed shrublands and increased overall plant diversity.\n\n**Combined Approaches**: Applying herbicide combined with sowing seeds of shrubland plants was found to increase shrub seedlings and native plant species, while also reducing non-native grass cover in some cases.\n\n**Grass Control with Seeding**: Cutting or mowing to control grass while simultaneously sowing shrubland seeds showed positive results, including increased shrub seedling abundance and reduced grass cover.\n\n**Planting Individual Plants**: While evidence is more limited, planting individual shrub plants showed successful establishment with a majority of planted plants surviving after one year.\n\nThese interventions demonstrate that both passive recovery (allowing natural regeneration) and active restoration techniques (seeding, planting, grass control) can be effective for restoring shrubland vegetation following fire events.",
