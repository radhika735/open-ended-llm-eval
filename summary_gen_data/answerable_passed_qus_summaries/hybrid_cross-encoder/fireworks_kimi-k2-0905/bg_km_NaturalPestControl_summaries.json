For using grazing instead of cutting, studies showed mixed effects on natural enemies with some species affected on some dates but not others, while pest responses varied between different groups and sampling periods.

Growing competitive plants is an effective approach, with nine studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK, and USA finding that planting competitive species reduced weed plant weight and ground cover, while five studies also found reduced weed reproduction and survival (Action 722). Incorporating plant remains that produce weed-controlling chemicals (allelopathic residues) into soil showed mixed results, with six studies finding reduction in weed growth in some cases, though effects varied between years, weed groups, and residue types (Action 728). Cover crops can help suppress weeds, with four studies from Israel and Italy finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops, though effects can vary by crop type and season (Action 1394). Mechanical methods such as rotovating and turf stripping have been tested but showed limited effectiveness for weed control specifically (Actions 1648, 1647). For invasive non-native plants on farmland, manual removal methods like cutting flower heads can be effective, with two studies from Czech Republic finding that removing all flower heads of giant hogweed at peak flowering time dramatically reduced seed production (Action 104). Additionally, organic farming systems generally promote various non-chemical weed management approaches (Action 717).",

Two studies found mixed effects of organic farming and two randomised, replicated, controlled studies found no effect.

Three studies (one randomised, replicated, controlled) found no or inconsistent effects on natural enemies and one study found a negative effect. Pests and diseases: One of eight studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found that organic farming reduced pests or disease, but two studies found more pests. Three studies found mixed effects and two studies found no effect. Crop damage: One of seven studies (including five randomised, replicated, controlled tests) found less crop damage in organic fields but two studies found more. One study found a mixed response and three studies found no or inconsistent effects.

Three randomised, replicated, controlled studies from the USA found more weeds in organically farmed fields, but in one of these studies this effect varied between crops and years. One study found no effect.

One study found mixed effects depending on date and other actions taken simultaneously (predator attractant and ground cover treatments). One study found no effect.

Sixty-four individual studies show some benefits to one or more wildlife groups.\\n\\n\\nSixty-five individual studies reported the effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Of these, fifty reported positive effects. Forty-one studies from eight European countries (including five reviews and twenty-three replicated controlled studies, of which one randomized and two site comparisons) found evidence that flower strips had a positive influence on invertebrate numbers with increased abundance, species richness/diversity, or both. Ten studies (nine replicated of which two controlled) found invertebrates visited or foraged on flower strips but did not specify increases/decreases in numbers. Two studies found effects on ground beetles other than changes in numbers. One replicated controlled study showed that ground beetles were more active or had enhanced feeding/reproductive conditions in flower strips. A review found flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Fifteen studies reported mixed or negative effects of flower strips on invertebrates. Six studies found no significant effects.\\n\\n\\nTwenty-one studies looked at the effects of flower strips on plants. Sixteen studies from seven European countries (including ten replicated controlled studies of which one randomized) found evidence that flower strips had higher plant cover, number of flowers, diversity, and species richness.

Four replicated, controlled studies from Switzerland and the UK (two of which were randomized) and one review of European studies found evidence that plots sown with a wildflower or legume seed mix had a positive influence on birds. Flower strips attracted more birds or bird species and the number of birds using flower strips increased over time. Eurasian skylarks preferentially foraged in, and nested in or near, sown weed patches and were less likely to abandon their territories when they included sown weed patches. However one replicated trial in Switzerland found barn owls avoided sown wildflower areas.
