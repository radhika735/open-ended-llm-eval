While some declining North American bumblebee species like the half-black bumblebee (*B. vagans*), yellow-banded bumblebee (*B. terricola*), and red-belted bumblebee (*B. rufocinctus*) have been successfully reared to adults, attempts to rear the yellow bumblebee (*B. fervidus*), the rusty-patched bumblebee, and the American bumblebee (*B. pensylvanicus*) resulted in the larvae dying before becoming adults [50]. The pollen diet is crucial, as fresh-frozen pollen produced larger queens with better survival rates than dried, frozen pollen [50]. Furthermore, higher protein content in pollen can lead to more offspring [50]. Artificial hibernation also presents challenges; while it can enhance egg-laying, it may result in smaller colonies. For better survival, queens should weigh over 0.6 g and be hibernated for four months or less [50]. Once reintroduced, colonies can face high rates of social parasitism, with rates of 25-66% in a Canadian trial and 79% in a UK trial, though five other trials reported no parasites [52]. The effectiveness of supplementary feeding for released colonies is inconclusive, with one trial finding it improved reproductive success while another found no increase in productivity [52].\n\n**Outcomes:**\nOn the positive side, laboratory rearing of several species has been successful, including the large garden bumblebee (*B. ruderatus*) and the Neotropical *B. atratus* [50]. The success of reintroduced colonies in producing new queens varies; two trials showed good numbers of new queens were produced, while two others in the UK reported very low or zero queen production [52]. Parasitism rates in the wild could be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability later in the season [52].

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
