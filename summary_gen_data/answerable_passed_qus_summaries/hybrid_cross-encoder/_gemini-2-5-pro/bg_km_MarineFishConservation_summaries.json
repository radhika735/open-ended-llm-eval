Modifying the configuration of a mesh escape panel, such as its position or size, has been found to improve the size-selectivity of haddock and whiting, although in some studies it had no effect on haddock and cod (2717). Fitting trawl nets with square mesh escape panels has also been shown to improve size-selectivity for Atlantic cod and haddock in some, but not all, studies (2716). The impact on haddock selectivity can also be influenced by the panel's mesh size, its position on the net, and the time of year (2716). For size-sorting grids, studies have shown they can improve size-selection for haddock, but not for saithe or cod (2720). The design and configuration of these grids can also lead to better size-selectivity for some species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, and hake, but the effect can vary between species (2728). In a study that combined mesh escape panels with a size-sorting grid, the size-selectivity of whiting was increased (2727). However, one study found that a net with a size-sorting grid did not improve the size-selection of cod and haddock any more than a net with a square mesh escape window (2720). Large, supported escape openings have been found to reduce the catch of unwanted fish, including immature red snapper (2723).",

In the same study, shark length was greater for two of five species/groups (2670). A different study in the Indian Ocean, South Africa, revealed that prohibiting offshore line fishing and all other boat-based fishing within a designated zone of a marine protected area resulted in higher abundances of four out of four fish species that are over-exploited by line fishing, in comparison to two zones where boat-based line and spear fishing were allowed (2671). This study also found that the same four fish species were larger in the area closed to fishing (2671). In a broader context, three studies examining the effects of prohibiting all fishing gears (both mobile and static) that target bottom-dwelling species produced varied results. One study reported higher numbers of larger and older cod in an area where these fishing gears had been prohibited for 15 years (2654). Another study found that fish densities in areas closed to such gear for at least 11 years varied by species, depth, and temperature (2654). The third study, however, found that prohibiting these fishing gears for 2-7 years had no effect on fish densities when compared to non-protected areas (2654).",

The species for which unwanted catches were reduced included brown trout, black sea bass, herring, bluethroat wrasse, leatherjacket, cod, protected rockfishes, whitefish, American eel, winter flounder, sharks, and rays, and in one of two cases, salmon and rainbow trout [2702]. In contrast, three other studies found that trap modification or type had no effect on unwanted catches of white croaker, non-commercial fish, or undersized Atlantic cod, and non-target haddock catches were increased [2702].\\n\\nThree of four replicated studies found that traps or pots modified with a square mesh escape window or larger mesh sizes improved the size-selectivity of Atlantic cod, black sea bass, and most fish species compared to smaller mesh and/or standard gear [2702]. However, one study found that increasing the mesh size of a trap escape panel had no effect on the size-selectivity of panga [2702].\\n\\nOne replicated, controlled study in the Bothnian Sea found that the survival of small herring that escaped from a pontoon fish trap through a size-sorting grid was similar to that of trap-caught herring that did not pass through a grid [2702].\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2702\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "A study in the Philippine Sea reported a greater number of fish species within the no-fishing/no-access zone of a marine protected area that had been established for 10 to 15 years, as compared to zones with partial fishing and unprotected fished areas (2674). Multiple studies have noted that implementing a zonation system for human activities is associated with a higher biomass and abundance of fish species, with the abundance levels varying depending on the degree of restriction (2674). Fish density, biomass, and abundance were found to be higher in non-fished (both no-entry and no-take) zones in comparison to fished zones (2674). In the Indian Ocean, a study identified that the abundances of four reef fish species were greater in a zone where almost all fishing was banned, compared to a nearby zone with fewer fishing constraints (2674). A separate study found that stopping offshore line fishing in a particular area led to increased abundances of four fish species that are commonly over-exploited by this fishing method (2671). In terms of fish size, it has been observed that four species of fish that are often over-exploited by line fishing were larger in a zone that had been closed to offshore line fishing for a period of two to seven years (2671). It was also found that various fish species had larger average lengths and sizes in zones that were designated as no-take or had stringent fishing regulations (2674).",
