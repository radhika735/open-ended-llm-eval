Restoring habitat along watercourses can support similar numbers of bees and bee species as remnant sites [1408]. Planting or maintaining ground cover, for example in olive orchards, has been shown to result in more bee species and more deposited pollen grains [1404]. Planting flower strips can lead to more pollinators on adjacent crops, and more wild bee species and individuals in the flower strips themselves [2468, 1406]. The composition and diversity of planted flowers can influence pollinator numbers, with some studies indicating that a greater number of flower species does not always result in more pollinators [2468, 1406]. Another supportive action is the use of no-tillage in arable fields, which was found to increase the number of pollinators compared to deep tillage [1405, 2516].",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time.
