Two studies in Germany indicated that closing roads during seasonal amphibian migration, sometimes combined with assisted crossings and barrier fences, protected many amphibians from being killed during breeding migrations [842].\n\nAnother common intervention is the installation of culverts or tunnels. Six of seven studies found that this significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, although one study noted this was only the case when barrier fencing was also installed [884]. The use of these crossings by amphibians was confirmed in 15 of 24 studies, with usage rates varying by species and culvert design. Factors influencing usage include culvert diameter, length, lighting, substrate, and the presence of water [884]. However, some culvert designs, such as those with vertical entry chutes or condensation from steel, can cause high mortality. One study also found that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road even with culverts present [884].\n\nUsing humans to physically assist migrating amphibians across roads has also been studied. Despite these efforts, two studies in Italy and the UK observed population declines of 64\u201370% over 6\u201310 years [784]. Furthermore, one UK study found that at 7% of assisted sites, over 500 toads were still killed on the roads [784]. These patrols can involve significant effort, with one case noting an average of 90 person-hours spent by patrols to move amphibians [784].",
