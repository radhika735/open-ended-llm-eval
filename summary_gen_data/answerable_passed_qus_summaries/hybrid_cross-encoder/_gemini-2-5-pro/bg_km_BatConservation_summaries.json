The Canadian study found that treating little brown bats at the time of infection increased survival in a laboratory setting [2008]. The US study found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium in a mine increased survival for free-flying bats but not for caged bats [2008]. The Canadian study also found that the treatment reduced disease symptoms in a laboratory, but the US study found a similar severity of the disease in treated and untreated bats in a mine [2008].",
