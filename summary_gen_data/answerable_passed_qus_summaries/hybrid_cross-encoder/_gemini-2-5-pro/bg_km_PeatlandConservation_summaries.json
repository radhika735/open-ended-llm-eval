    "relevant_summary": "Several studies have examined the use of prescribed fire as a peatland management tool, with documented benefits and negative impacts. In terms of benefits, prescribed fire has been shown to increase moss and lichen cover, including Sphagnum, in some peat bogs (1774). One study found that burning increased cottongrass cover after 8-18 years (1774), and another noted an increase in the biomass of grass-like plants in frequently burned plots (1774). Prescribed fire has also been documented to lower the cover of heather (1774) and reduce tree and shrub cover (1763), which can be beneficial for restoring or maintaining certain peatland habitats. Two studies found that burning increased plant species richness or diversity (1763). Additionally, leaving some areas unburned during prescribed burning was found to increase the abundance of Karner blue butterflies in one study (3879) and six out of nine specialist butterfly species in another (3879).\n\nConversely, some negative impacts have been reported. Two studies found that burning reduced or limited plant species richness (1774). One study in a bog reported that more frequent burning led to less total vegetation, shrub, and bryophyte biomass (1774). Another study in a fen reported that burning, along with other interventions, reduced grass, sedge, and rush cover (1763). In some cases, prescribed fire had no effect on certain vegetation types, such as the cover of fen-characteristic mosses and herbs in one study (1673), and cottongrass cover in the short term in another (1774).",
