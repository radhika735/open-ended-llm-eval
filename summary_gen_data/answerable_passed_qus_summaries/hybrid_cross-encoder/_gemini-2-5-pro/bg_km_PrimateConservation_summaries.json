Conversely, one controlled study in Malaysia found that a population of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years despite staff and volunteers having received medical checks (1546). No evidence was found for the effects of avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates or implementing a health programme for local communities on primate populations (1555, 1557).",
