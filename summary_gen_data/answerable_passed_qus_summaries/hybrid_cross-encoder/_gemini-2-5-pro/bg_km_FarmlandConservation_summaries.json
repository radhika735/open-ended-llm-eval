These include topsoil removal, the introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, and mowing (119). Additionally, hay spreading is an effective technique for restoring species-rich grassland (133). Specific management of wet meadows has involved mowing once a year in the autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses (3971).\n\nVarious studies have monitored the effects of these restoration efforts. Some studies have shown positive effects on the plant community within five years of restoration (119), while others indicate that restoration may not be complete even after 9 or 20 years (119). The restoration of species-rich grasslands has been found to result in higher abundance and diversity of ground beetles, farmland birds, pollinating insects, and earthworms (133). In terms of specific species, the removal of trees and shrubs from wet meadows led to an increase in marsh fritillary caterpillar webs (3971). However, cattle grazing on wet grassland was found to lower the number of bog fritillaries (3971). The abundance of marsh fritillary caterpillar webs was higher in wet grasslands grazed at an intermediate intensity by cattle, compared to high or low intensity grazing (3971).",

Three replicated studies from Sweden and the UK (one also controlled and two site comparisons) found that restored grassland had a lower diversity and frequency of certain plant species, and attracted fewer foraging queen bumblebees than continuously grazed or unmanaged grasslands.\\nWe captured 40 studies (including 19 replicated and controlled studies of which six were also randomized, and six reviews) from nine European countries that found ten different techniques used alone or in combinations were effective for restoring species-rich grassland. Effective techniques included: grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing.\\nWe found 22 studies from seven European countries that included information on the length of time taken to restore grassland communities (including 16 replicated trials of which nine also controlled and three reviews). Six studies saw positive signs of restoration in less than five years, 11 studies within 10 years and two studies found restoration took more than 10 years.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Studies have also noted that birds tend to favor and utilize these mixtures more than other habitats (594, 187).

These areas can provide benefits to farmland birds, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, including increased species richness of plants, bumblebees, and spiders, and an increased abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates and ground beetles (562). Specifically for birds, benefits include increased stone curlew breeding population size, northern lapwing hatching success, and Eurasian skylark nesting success (562). Uncropped margins, whether naturally regenerated or sown with wildflowers, have been shown to support a higher abundance and, in some cases, higher species richness of foraging bumblebees compared to cropped edges (19, 20, 562). Sown wildflower margins with perennial leguminous herbs are particularly beneficial for long-tongued bumblebees (19).\n\nHowever, there are also limitations. The value of naturally regenerated margins for bees can be inconsistent from year to year and may rely on the presence of thistle species, which are often considered pernicious weeds (20). Some studies found no effect on 11 out of 12 farmland bird species or ground beetles, and one study found fewer seed-eating birds on fallow plots in two out of three regions (562). Pernicious weeds can also be more common on uncropped cultivated margins (562). Additionally, a UK study found a lower proportion of young grey partridges in populations in areas with a high proportion of uncropped cultivated margins and plots (562). There is no captured evidence on the effects of these management practices on solitary bees (19, 20).",
