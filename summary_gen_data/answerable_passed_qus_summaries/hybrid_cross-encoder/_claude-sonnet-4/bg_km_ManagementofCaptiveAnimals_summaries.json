    "provider": null,
    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available research evidence, several food-based enrichment strategies have proven effective for reducing stereotypic behaviors in large captive carnivores. Presenting food frozen in ice has been shown to decrease abnormal or stereotypic behaviors and increase activity levels in bears and felids (Action 1923). Two replicated before-and-after studies found this method particularly effective, though manipulation behaviors showed mixed results, increasing in lions while decreasing in grizzly bears (Action 1923). \n\nHiding food around enclosures has demonstrated consistent benefits, with four replicated studies showing increased exploring and foraging behaviors in black bears, leopard cats, bush dogs, maned wolves, and Malayan sun bears (Action 1915). This strategy also decreased stereotypical pacing in leopard cats and black bears, and reduced daytime sleeping in Canadian lynx (Action 1915).\n\nProviding bones, hides, or partial carcasses has shown effectiveness across multiple felid species, with replicated studies demonstrating decreased stereotypic behaviors in lions, tigers, and Arctic foxes, while also increasing activity and manipulation time in felids and red foxes (Action 1902).\n\nImplementing unpredictable feeding schedules has proven particularly effective for reducing stereotypic pacing behaviors. Three replicated studies across multiple countries found that random temporal feeding schedules reduced pacing frequency in tigers and cheetahs, while also increasing behavioral diversity in red foxes and alertness in black-footed cats (Action 1904).\n\nPresenting food inside objects such as Boomer balls showed positive results in bears, with studies in Germany and India finding increased exploratory and foraging behaviors and decreased stereotypic behaviors in sloth bears and spectacled bears (Action 1924).\n\nPrey simulation devices including lures, pulleys, and bungees increased activity levels and behavioral diversity in felids, with one study showing decreased pacing behavior in cougars, though initial increases in pacing were observed in tigers when provided with a carcass on a bungee (Action 1927).",
