    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for acoustic devices to reduce human-wildlife conflict shows different patterns between aquaculture systems and fishing gear applications. At aquaculture systems (Action 2775), six studies were conducted with four of six studies finding that acoustic devices at salmon farms reduced predation on caged salmon by grey seals, harbour seals and South American sea lions, or reduced the number of harbour seals approaching fish cages. However, two studies found that acoustic devices did not reduce harbour seal predation at salmon farms or reduce the presence, approach distances, group sizes or time spent around fin-fish farms by common bottlenose dolphins.\n\nFor fishing gear applications (Action 2808), thirty-three studies evaluated acoustic devices with more extensive evidence. In terms of human-wildlife conflict specifically, five of six controlled studies found that acoustic devices reduced damage to fish catches and/or fishing nets caused by common bottlenose dolphins and seals, while one study found acoustic devices did not reduce damage to swordfish catches by California sea lions. Additionally, acoustic devices on fishing gear showed broader benefits with nine studies finding reduced collisions or entanglements of various marine mammals including humpback whales, harbour porpoises, Franciscana dolphins, beaked whales and small cetaceans, though some studies found mixed results or no effect for certain species.\n\nThe evidence base for fishing gear applications (33 studies) is substantially larger than for aquaculture systems (6 studies). Both applications show predominantly positive but not universal effectiveness, with fishing gear studies demonstrating additional conservation benefits through reduced entanglements beyond human-wildlife conflict reduction. Related acoustic approaches include devices on fishing vessels (Action 2815) where one study found no reduction in predation of squid catches by Risso's dolphins, and acoustic decoys (Action 2820) where one study found limited effectiveness in diverting sperm whales from fishing lines.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for interventions that directly manage individual mammals to boost threatened populations includes several approaches with varying degrees of success. Captive breeding and release programs show mixed results: captive-bred mammals generally have lower post-release survival rates than wild-born translocated animals, though populations of mountain gazelles, Corsican red deer, P\u00e8re David's deer, Eurasian otters and swift foxes increased following release (2476). Reviews found that over half of mammal release programs were considered successful, with 61% of macropod releases resulting in successful population establishment and 40% surviving over five years (2476). For marine mammals, two of three Antillean manatees and two of 14 Florida manatees born in captivity and released survived for at least one year (2933). Captive breeding itself shows promise, with the majority of 118 captive-bred mammal populations increasing in a global review (2471). Supplementary feeding to boost survival and reproduction shows positive results in some species: it increased abundance or density of bank voles, red squirrels, striped mice, brown hyena and black-backed jackals, and increased survival of mule deer, bank voles, northern flying squirrels and eastern cottontail rabbits (2367). Disease management interventions also show effectiveness: vaccination programs reduced rabies frequency in red foxes, reduced tuberculosis in Eurasian badgers, and halted a rabies outbreak in Ethiopian wolves, with red fox numbers increasing following anti-rabies vaccination (2582). Medical treatment healed most mouflons infected with foot rot disease (2581). Targeted removal of problematic individuals can benefit populations, as removing aggressive male Hawaiian monk seals increased survival of adult females and reduced injuries (2929). Providing artificial refuges during releases shows mixed success: some studies found higher abundances at sites with artificial burrows, while others found no difference (2453).",

Nine studies found that using acoustic devices on cod traps or fishing nets resulted in fewer collisions and entanglements, though effectiveness varied by location - one study in the North Sea and Baltic Sea found acoustic devices reduced harbour porpoise entanglements in one fishing area but not another.\n\nAcoustically reflective fishing gear materials (action 2807) show promise, with two controlled studies in the North Sea and Bay of Fundy finding that fishing nets made from acoustically reflective materials (iron-oxide or barium sulfate) had fewer entanglements of harbour porpoises than conventional fishing nets. However, one study found that nets made from barium sulfate did not reduce dolphin entanglements.\n\nExclusion and escape devices for mammals (action 2823) demonstrate effectiveness in some contexts, with controlled studies showing that installing exclusion and/or escape devices on trawl nets reduced the number of trapped or entangled marine mammals, though survival rates through escape hatches were variable with less than one third of common bottlenose dolphins exiting escape hatches alive.\n\nAdditional interventions include acoustic devices on moorings (action 2816), which reduced activity of harbour porpoises, short-beaked common dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins in some studies, and modified gillnet configurations (action 2701) which showed mixed results for reducing unwanted catch in Atlantic waters.",
