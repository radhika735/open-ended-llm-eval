Altering the timing of insecticide use resulted in more natural enemies when insecticides were sprayed earlier rather than later in the growing season (Action 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels increased numbers of natural enemies in two of three years, though effects lasted for as little as three weeks (Action 750). Additionally, threshold-based spraying regimes resulted in fewer pesticide applications being needed (Action 750). Delaying herbicide use led to more natural enemies, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited and fewer groups benefited early in the season (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests, though effects on natural enemy populations were not monitored (Action 726). Using mass-emergence devices to increase natural enemy populations resulted in higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site in urban areas (Action 775).",
