General tree logging/removal within forests showed mixed but positive results, with four of seven studies finding that logging trees increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action ID: 1273).

Effects on young trees are more variable, with five of 15 studies finding increased density and biomass, two finding decreased density, and eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (action 1220). For understory vegetation, prescribed fire shows both benefits and negative impacts - eight of 22 studies found increased cover, density and biomass while six found decreased plant cover (action 1221). However, understory plant diversity generally benefits, with 14 of 24 studies finding increased species richness and diversity, while only one found decreased richness (action 1221). Wildlife effects are also mixed - for amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance (action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found higher species richness in burned compared to unburned forests, and two studies found higher butterfly abundance in recently burned areas (action 3877).

This approach also increased the density of young trees in France (Action 1274). Cutting and mowing can be used to control problematic herbaceous plants, though effectiveness varies - studies in fens showed mixed effects on vegetation cover, with some increasing characteristic plant species but having variable impacts on overall plant community composition (Action 1770).\n\n**Physical barriers and ground covering:** Covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses in Canada (Action 1239). However, weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in Hong Kong (Action 1267). Covering the ground with mulch after planting increased total plant cover in the USA (Action 1240).\n\n**Manual weeding:** Weeding can be used to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities, though no quantitative evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1588).\n\n**Mid-storey vegetation removal:** Removing mid-storey vegetation in forest increased both mammal species richness and abundance in the USA (Action 2480).\n\nThe evidence shows that mechanical disturbance combined with vegetation removal appears most effective for promoting tree establishment, while ground covering methods have variable results depending on the specific technique used.",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on the effectiveness of different methods to control invasive plant species in forests is limited and shows mixed results. Herbicide control has shown no effect on native plant species richness according to replicated, randomized, controlled studies in the USA (actions 1229, 1314). Mechanical/manual removal methods have produced varying outcomes: removal of invasive grass species increased understory plant biomass in Hawaii, but had no effect on understory plant diversity in the USA. Invasive weed removal increased tree seedling height in Ghana, but showed no effect on growth rate of native species in Hawaii (action 1228). For manual control or removal of midstorey and ground-level vegetation in forests, evidence from multiple studies shows mixed results on bird species richness and densities, with some studies finding higher species richness and others finding similar or lower numbers compared to control areas (action 335). Prescribed burning for invasive species control has been studied for specific species like lantana, where burning made plants smaller and less abundant compared to unburned areas in Australia, and resulted in fewer new shoots compared to cutting in India (action 912). However, burning also increased seed germination rates for lantana when seeds were exposed to smoke. Evidence for biological control using herbivores is lacking, with no studies found testing this approach (action 1277). The overall evidence base is limited with most studies being single investigations in specific locations, making it difficult to draw general conclusions about the most effective control methods.",

Action 1157 states there is no evidence found for the effect of raising awareness amongst the general public through campaigns and public information on forests specifically. However, evidence from related conservation contexts provides some insights. Action 162 indicates that a review of programmes in the USA and Canada argues that education was not sufficient to change behaviour on its own, although it was necessary as a catalytic factor for economic incentives and law enforcement. Action 274 found that five out of six studies from across the world showed increases in bird populations or decreases in mortality following education programmes, with one study from Canada also finding a significant shift in local peoples' attitudes to conservation following educational programmes. Action 1571 provides evidence that multimedia campaigns using theatre, film, print media and discussions showed positive results, with studies in Belize finding black howler monkey numbers increased by 61-138% over 3-13 years after multimedia campaigns alongside other interventions, and studies in Brazil and Colombia finding that education programs improved attitudes towards and knowledge about species. Action 3681 found that community engagement in conservation activities showed positive results for reptile populations across six studies, with communities participating in monitoring and protection leading to reduced poaching and improved conservation outcomes. Action 1844 reported that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased, demonstrating behaviour change from public awareness campaigns.",

For wire fencing, the evidence is more extensive: five of ten studies in Australia, Bhutan, Canada, France, Portugal and the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect on cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants (Action 1230). Regarding effects on young trees specifically, wire fencing showed mixed results - one study found it increased biomass, one found it decreased the density of young trees, and one found mixed effects depending on the species (Action 1230). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased tree density (Action 1230). Additional research on non-electric fencing found that a high woven wire fence with small mesh, an overhang and an apron was the most effective design at deterring crossings by coyotes (Action 2415). The evidence base for electric fencing appears more limited compared to wire fencing, with only one study identified specifically evaluating electric fencing effectiveness against large native herbivores.",

For wire fencing, the evidence is more extensive: five of ten studies in Australia, Bhutan, Canada, France, Portugal and the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased the cover and size of understory plants, while six studies found no effect on cover, seed density, species richness or diversity of understory plants (Action 1230). Regarding effects on young trees specifically, wire fencing showed mixed results - one study found it increased biomass, one found it decreased the density of young trees, and one found mixed effects depending on the species (Action 1230). Two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that using wire fencing to exclude large herbivores increased tree density (Action 1230). Additional research on non-electric fencing found that a high woven wire fence with small mesh, an overhang and an apron was the most effective design at deterring crossings by coyotes (Action 2415). The evidence base for electric fencing appears more limited compared to wire fencing, with only one study identified specifically evaluating electric fencing effectiveness against large native herbivores.\", \"action_ids\": [\"1230\",\"1231\",\"2415\"]}",
