General tree logging/removal within forests showed mixed but positive results, with four of seven studies finding that logging trees increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action ID: 1273).

Effects on young trees are more variable, with five of 15 studies finding increased density and biomass, two finding decreased density, and eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (action 1220). For understory vegetation, prescribed fire shows both benefits and negative impacts - eight of 22 studies found increased cover, density and biomass while six found decreased plant cover (action 1221). However, understory plant diversity generally benefits, with 14 of 24 studies finding increased species richness and diversity, while only one found decreased richness (action 1221). Wildlife effects are also mixed - for amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance (action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found higher species richness in burned compared to unburned forests, and two studies found higher butterfly abundance in recently burned areas (action 3877).

However, one study in the USA found thinning decreased plant biomass and one paired-site study in Canada found that logging after wildfire decreased species richness and diversity of mosses (Action 1234). For sowing tree seeds after wildfire, three studies in the USA examined the effect of sowing herbaceous plant seeds in burnt forest areas and found several harmful effects: one study found it decreased the number and cover of native species and one found it decreased the density of tree seedlings (Action 1236). All three studies found no beneficial effect of seeding on total plant cover or species richness (Action 1236). Regarding erosion control, using erosion blankets after seeding showed some benefits: one study in Spain found that using an organic blanket after sowing seeds increased plant species richness and plant density (Action 3431), while two studies in the USA and Spain found it did not alter vegetation cover (Action 3431).",
