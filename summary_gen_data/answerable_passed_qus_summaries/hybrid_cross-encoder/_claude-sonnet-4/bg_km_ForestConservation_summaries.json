General tree logging/removal within forests showed mixed but positive results, with four of seven studies finding that logging trees increased species richness and diversity of understory plants, while three studies found no effect (Action ID: 1273).

Effects on young trees are more variable, with five of 15 studies finding increased density and biomass, two finding decreased density, and eight showing no effect or mixed effects depending on tree species, location and fire frequency (action 1220). For understory vegetation, prescribed fire shows both benefits and negative impacts - eight of 22 studies found increased cover, density and biomass while six found decreased plant cover (action 1221). However, understory plant diversity generally benefits, with 14 of 24 studies finding increased species richness and diversity, while only one found decreased richness (action 1221). Wildlife effects are also mixed - for amphibians, eight of 14 studies found no effect on abundance or species numbers, while four found mixed effects and three found increased abundance (action 877). For butterflies and moths, three of four studies found higher species richness in burned compared to unburned forests, and two studies found higher butterfly abundance in recently burned areas (action 3877).

This approach also increased the density of young trees in France (Action 1274). Cutting and mowing can be used to control problematic herbaceous plants, though effectiveness varies - studies in fens showed mixed effects on vegetation cover, with some increasing characteristic plant species but having variable impacts on overall plant community composition (Action 1770).\n\n**Physical barriers and ground covering:** Covering the ground with plastic mats after restoration planting decreased the cover of herbaceous plants and grasses in Canada (Action 1239). However, weed mats showed no effect on seedling height in Hong Kong (Action 1267). Covering the ground with mulch after planting increased total plant cover in the USA (Action 1240).\n\n**Manual weeding:** Weeding can be used to promote regeneration of indigenous tree communities, though no quantitative evidence was found for its effectiveness (Action 1588).\n\n**Mid-storey vegetation removal:** Removing mid-storey vegetation in forest increased both mammal species richness and abundance in the USA (Action 2480).\n\nThe evidence shows that mechanical disturbance combined with vegetation removal appears most effective for promoting tree establishment, while ground covering methods have variable results depending on the specific technique used.",
