    "relevant_summary": "Forest canopy opening through clearing, coppicing, and thinning has different effects on butterfly and moth communities. Clearing or opening patches in forests generally benefits butterflies but can negatively impact moths. Studies found that cleared patches in forests had greater species richness of butterflies but lower species richness of moths than unmanaged patches or closed canopy forest (action 3938). Butterfly abundance was higher in cleared patches that were also managed with coppicing and grazing compared to before management or unmanaged areas, though butterfly abundance declined over the first three years after clearing (action 3938). Larger cleared patches supported higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than undisturbed forest, while smaller patches did not show this benefit (action 3938). For moths, wider woodland rides had lower abundance of macro-moths than standard width rides or mature forest (action 3938). Coppicing woodland shows positive effects for butterflies, with coppiced woodland having greater species richness of butterflies than unmanaged woodland, and higher abundance of butterflies generally and heath fritillary specifically (action 3939). However, coppiced woodland had lower species richness and abundance of macro-moths than mature forest (action 3939). The timing of coppicing matters, with woodland coppiced 2-4 years ago showing greater butterfly abundance than woodland coppiced 5-11 or >15 years ago (action 3939). Thinning trees within forests combined with other management practices like prescribed burning or mulching resulted in greater species richness and abundance of butterflies compared to unmanaged woodland or before management (action 3940). Studies found that partially-cleared forest plots had higher butterfly but lower moth species richness than closed-canopy forest plots (action 3940). When comparing different harvesting methods, thinning resulted in higher macro-moth species richness than patch-cutting or clearcutting, with richness similar to unharvested forest (action 3868).",

For leaving unburned areas during prescribed burning, one replicated study reported that Karner blue butterfly abundance increased over 2-3 years in oak savannas and prairies where unburned patches were left, and Karner blue butterflies were recorded using all 11 unburned patches surveyed (Action 3879). Additionally, one study found that six out of nine specialist butterfly species were more abundant in pine barrens and prairies where unburned areas were left compared to sites without unburned areas (Action 3879).\n\nFor rotational burning, multiple studies show that the total abundance of prairie specialist, grassland and all butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one, two or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management (Action 3883). Two studies found that species richness of butterflies was higher on prairies burned more than one or four years ago than on prairies burned in the last one or two years under rotational burning management (Action 3883). The abundance of grassland and generalist butterflies was highest in the third year after burning, and migrant butterflies in the first year after burning under rotational management (Action 3883).\n\nHowever, rotational burning showed mixed effects for different species. Four of six studies found that rotational burning in prairies had mixed effects on butterflies compared to unmanaged sites, and one study found that prairies managed by rotational burning had more strongly declining populations of grass-skipper butterflies than unmanaged areas (Action 3883). For fritillary species, rotational burning had variable effects, with some species showing lower abundance in rotationally burned prairies in at least one surveyed region (Action 3883).

Using shielded \"full cut-off\" lights to remove outwards lighting was found to attract fewer individual moths and moth species than conventional lights without blinds or filters in a study in Slovenia (action 3904). Low intensity lighting also reduces moth attraction, with a study in Germany finding that fewer moths were attracted to low intensity lights that emitted a narrower range of yellow light with little UV compared to higher intensity lights with broader spectra including UV (action 3902). The use of \"warmer\" (red/yellow) lighting rather than other lighting colors shows promise, with four studies in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK finding that fewer individual moths and moth species were attracted to yellow, green, white or red lights compared to UV, actinic, blue or conventional metal halide lights (action 3906). Additional potential actions include restricting use of polarized light (action 3903), using glazing treatments to reduce light spill from inside lit buildings (action 3905), restricting timing of lighting to conserve areas with natural light regimes (action 3901), minimizing road lighting to reduce insect attraction (action 3852), removing or changing turbine lighting to reduce insect attraction (action 3843), and using barriers or vegetation to reduce artificial light (action 3618), though no studies were found evaluating the effects of these specific actions on moth populations.",

Specifically for large copper, translocated populations survived for up to 38 years but ultimately died out or required supplementation by further releases (Action 3909).\n\nFor captive-bred releases, six studies reported that populations persisted for 2-28 years and increased in abundance, while two studies found that captive-bred populations died out one, two, or 12 years after release, or required further releases to survive (Action 3914). One study found that only three of 10 captive-bred barberry carpet moth populations established, with at least one persisting for five years (Action 3914).\n\nFor translocation outside known range, two of three studies reported that populations persisted and increased in abundance over eight and 28 years, while one population died out within one year (Action 3911). \n\nCaptive breeding programs showed that populations could be successfully maintained, with some species reared for 12 generations or more than 25 years in captivity (Action 3916).

One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that a captive population of marsh fritillary increased in size over two years. One study in Poland\\u00a0reported that all captive-reared scarce large blue caterpillars died within 35 days. One review\\u00a0reported that attempts to rear caterpillars of four species of large blue had mixed success.\\nReproductive success (5 studies): One controlled study in the UK\\u00a0reported that female large copper laid more eggs, and these eggs had a higher hatching success, in a cage kept in a greenhouse than in a cage kept outside. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that a Dickson\\u2019s copper butterfly laid eggs in captivity in the presence of black cocktail ants from the site where she emerged but not from 10 km away. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that female large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years laid more eggs than females from a population in its third generation in captivity. One study in the UK\\u00a0reported that Fisher\\u2019s estuarine moths successfully bred in captivity. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught, gravid scarce mountain copper butterflies laid eggs but none hatched.\\nSurvival (14 studies): Five of six studies (including one replicated, controlled study, four controlled studies and one site comparison study) in the UK, the UK and France, Spain, Belgium\\u00a0and Poland\\u00a0found that large copper, large blue, mountain Alcon blue, cranberry fritillary\\u00a0and scarce large blue\\u00a0caterpillars had higher survival rates when reared on plants\\u00a0or in ant nests\\u00a0at a lower than higher density, in ant nests without queens\\u00a0or with winged females\\u00a0present than with queens\\u00a0or without winged females, when reared at 20 \\u00b0C than 25 \\u00b0C, and when reared with ants collected from sites where parasitic butterfly species occur than from sites where parasites do not occur. The sixth study\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars had a similar survival rate in ant nests with or without queens present. Two of these studies, and one replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the USA, found that the survival of large blue, mountain Alcon blue\\u00a0and monarch\\u00a0caterpillars differed when reared in ant nests of different species\\u00a0or on different species of milkweed. Two site comparison studies in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that large copper\\u00a0and Puget blue\\u00a0eggs had a similar survival rate to the caterpillar\\u00a0and adult\\u00a0stage whether they were laid in captivity or collected from the wild and reared in captivity. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars kept in refrigerators while overwintering had a lower survival than caterpillars kept in environmental chambers or outside. Three of four studies in South Africa\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that some wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly, Karkloof blue butterfly\\u00a0and Fishers\\u2019 estuarine\\u00a0moth eggs hatched, survived as caterpillars for three months\\u00a0or to adulthood, bred in captivity\\u00a0and the resulting captive population survived for at least eight generations. The other study reported that wild-collected Brenton blue butterfly eggs hatched in captivity and those caterpillars reared with only Pyllanthus incurvatus leaves died whereas all caterpillars also given Indigofera erecta leaves survived to the fourth instar of development. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that wild-caught final instar Cape Peninsula butterfly caterpillars reared in an artificial pugnacious ant nest successfully pupated and became adults, but captive-hatched first instar Cape Peninsula and Riley\\u2019s skolly butterfly caterpillars placed next to a nest did not survive to pupation.\\nCondition (5 studies): Two studies (including one controlled study) in the UK\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that adult large white from a population kept in captivity for &gt;25 years were heavier, and had smaller wings, than individuals from a population in its third generation in captivity, and captive-reared Puget blue adults were smaller than wild-caught butterflies. One of these studies also found that Puget blue caterpillars raised in environmental chambers or outdoor enclosures reached a similar size as adults. One replicated, controlled study in Spain\\u00a0found that mountain Alcon blue caterpillars reared in ant colonies with winged females were lighter than caterpillars reared in colonies without winged females. One replicated, controlled study in Israel\\u00a0found that spring webworm caterpillars fed vegetation from cattle-grazed pasture had a similar growth rate to caterpillars fed vegetation from an ungrazed paddock. One study in South Africa\\u00a0reported that Brenton blue butterfly caterpillars reared on Indigofera erecta leaves with no ants became dwarf adults, but those reared on whole Indigofera plants with an ant colony became full-sized adults.\\n\\nBEHAVIOUR (0 STUDIES)\"\n}"
