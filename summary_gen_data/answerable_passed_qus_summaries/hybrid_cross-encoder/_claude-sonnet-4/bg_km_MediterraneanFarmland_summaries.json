    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several specific practices can increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards. Ground cover planting or maintenance in orchards and vineyards is particularly effective, with ten studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover, including two meta-analyses from Mediterranean climates (Action 1367). Cover crops grown beneath the main crop or between crop rows also increase soil organic matter, with controlled trials from India and South Africa finding increased soil organic matter under cover crops (Action 897). Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers shows positive results, with eight replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer (Action 1366). Adding compost directly to the soil is highly effective, with twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost (Action 1362). Reduced tillage practices also help, with a meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries and eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains contributes to organic matter, with six studies from China, Denmark and India finding higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910). Retaining crop residues is beneficial, with two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China finding higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained (Action 907). Adding slurry to the soil shows some potential, though results are mixed, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain finding more organic matter in soils with added slurry compared to soils without it (Action 1365).",

    "relevant_summary": "Cover crops in arable fields on Mediterranean farmland show predominantly positive effects on soil health with mixed effects on crop production. Regarding soil health, cover crops consistently increase soil organic matter and carbon, with one meta-analysis from Mediterranean-type climates and ten studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA showing higher organic matter in soils with winter cover crops (Action 1345). Cover crops also enhance soil nitrogen content, with ten studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons, though results can be inconsistent (Action 1345). Soil biology is improved, with five studies from the USA showing increased microbial biomass under cover crops, and studies documenting more beneficial bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and earthworms (Action 1345). Cover crops significantly reduce soil erosion, with controlled studies from Israel and the USA demonstrating less erosion compared to fallows or bare soils, and increase water-stable soil aggregates (Action 1345). One study from Denmark found improved soil structure and nutrient retention, while studies show reduced nitrate leaching (Action 898). For crop production, effects are variable. Six studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, while three studies from Italy and the USA found higher yields in some comparisons (Action 1351). Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351). Implementation with legume cover crops consistently shows better results, with eight studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding higher cash crop yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). One study from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils previously under ryegrass cover crops (Action 898).",

One study from Italy found the least erosion with permanent cover crops, and the most erosion with temporary cover crops. Additionally, four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile and Spain found that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops, compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367).\n\n**Cover Crops Between Rows**: Two studies from France and the USA showed reduced erosion under cover crops, with one controlled study showing that soil stability was highest under a grass cover, and one randomized replicated study finding that cover crops reduced soil loss (Action 897).\n\n**Cover Crops in Arable Fields**: Two controlled studies from Israel and the USA found less erosion of soils with cover crops compared to soils with fallows or bare soils (Action 1345). Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water-stable soil aggregates in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them (Action 1345).\n\n**Reduced Tillage**: One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Egypt found less erosion with less tillage (one pass with the tractor, compared to two), but found more erosion with shallower tillage compared to deeper (Action 1371). Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371).\n\n**Soil Amendment with Compost**: Two replicated, controlled studies from Spain found less erosion of soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost (Action 1362). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and Turkey found that soils with added compost were more stable than soils without added compost (Action 1362).\n\n**Manure Application**: One controlled, randomized, replicated study from India found lower soil loss and water runoff with manure application in combination with other treatments (Action 911).",
