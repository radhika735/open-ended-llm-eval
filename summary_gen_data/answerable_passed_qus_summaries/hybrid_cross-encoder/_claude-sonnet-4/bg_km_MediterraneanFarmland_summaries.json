    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several specific practices can increase soil organic matter in Mediterranean vineyards. Ground cover planting or maintenance in orchards and vineyards is particularly effective, with ten studies from Chile, France, Spain, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover, including two meta-analyses from Mediterranean climates (Action 1367). Cover crops grown beneath the main crop or between crop rows also increase soil organic matter, with controlled trials from India and South Africa finding increased soil organic matter under cover crops (Action 897). Using organic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers shows positive results, with eight replicated studies from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Mediterranean countries finding more organic matter in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer (Action 1366). Adding compost directly to the soil is highly effective, with twelve replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost (Action 1362). Reduced tillage practices also help, with a meta-analysis from multiple Mediterranean countries and eleven replicated studies from Italy, Spain, Syria, and the USA finding more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Amending soil with fresh plant material or crop remains contributes to organic matter, with six studies from China, Denmark and India finding higher carbon levels when plant material was added (Action 910). Retaining crop residues is beneficial, with two randomized, replicated trials from Australia and China finding higher soil organic carbon when residues were retained (Action 907). Adding slurry to the soil shows some potential, though results are mixed, with one replicated, randomized, controlled study from Spain finding more organic matter in soils with added slurry compared to soils without it (Action 1365).",

    "relevant_summary": "Cover crops in arable fields on Mediterranean farmland show predominantly positive effects on soil health with mixed effects on crop production. Regarding soil health, cover crops consistently increase soil organic matter and carbon, with one meta-analysis from Mediterranean-type climates and ten studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA showing higher organic matter in soils with winter cover crops (Action 1345). Cover crops also enhance soil nitrogen content, with ten studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding more nitrogen in soils with winter cover crops in some comparisons, though results can be inconsistent (Action 1345). Soil biology is improved, with five studies from the USA showing increased microbial biomass under cover crops, and studies documenting more beneficial bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and earthworms (Action 1345). Cover crops significantly reduce soil erosion, with controlled studies from Israel and the USA demonstrating less erosion compared to fallows or bare soils, and increase water-stable soil aggregates (Action 1345). One study from Denmark found improved soil structure and nutrient retention, while studies show reduced nitrate leaching (Action 898). For crop production, effects are variable. Six studies from Spain and the USA found lower cash crop yields with winter cover crops in some comparisons, while three studies from Italy and the USA found higher yields in some comparisons (Action 1351). Seven controlled studies from France, Israel, Spain, and the USA found no differences in cash crop yields between plots with or without cover crops (Action 1351). Implementation with legume cover crops consistently shows better results, with eight studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA finding higher cash crop yields when legumes were used as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351). One study from the USA found higher tomato yield from soils previously under ryegrass cover crops (Action 898).",

One study from Italy found the least erosion with permanent cover crops, and the most erosion with temporary cover crops. Additionally, four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Chile and Spain found that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops, compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367).\n\n**Cover Crops Between Rows**: Two studies from France and the USA showed reduced erosion under cover crops, with one controlled study showing that soil stability was highest under a grass cover, and one randomized replicated study finding that cover crops reduced soil loss (Action 897).\n\n**Cover Crops in Arable Fields**: Two controlled studies from Israel and the USA found less erosion of soils with cover crops compared to soils with fallows or bare soils (Action 1345). Two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water-stable soil aggregates in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them (Action 1345).\n\n**Reduced Tillage**: One replicated, randomized, controlled study from Egypt found less erosion with less tillage (one pass with the tractor, compared to two), but found more erosion with shallower tillage compared to deeper (Action 1371). Three replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain found that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371).\n\n**Soil Amendment with Compost**: Two replicated, controlled studies from Spain found less erosion of soils with added compost compared to soils without added compost (Action 1362). Four replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and Turkey found that soils with added compost were more stable than soils without added compost (Action 1362).\n\n**Manure Application**: One controlled, randomized, replicated study from India found lower soil loss and water runoff with manure application in combination with other treatments (Action 911).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several habitat creation actions can support pollinators on Mediterranean farmland besides hedgerow planting. Planting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wildflower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species (Action 19). Planting flowers generally increases pollinator numbers, with some flower species being more attractive to pollinators than others (Action 1406). Ground cover management in orchards and vineyards can support more bee species and pollen deposition compared to abandoned orchards (Action 1404). Creating and restoring species-rich, semi-natural grassland results in increased pollinating insect density and diversity (Action 133). Planting grass buffer strips around arable or pasture fields increases arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity, with some margins providing benefits to bumblebees and other invertebrates (Action 246). Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, particularly for bumblebees (Action 14). Restoring habitat along watercourses supports bee communities and native flower visitation (Action 1408). Managing agricultural landscapes to enhance floral resources through agri-environment agreements positively correlates with increased abundance of long-tongued bumblebees on field margins (Action 362). Creating beetle banks provides additional habitat features that can support beneficial arthropods (Action 2393).",

Planting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wildflower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species (Action 19). Planting flowers generally increases pollinator numbers, with some flower species being more attractive to pollinators than others (Action 1406). Ground cover management in orchards and vineyards can support more bee species and pollen deposition compared to abandoned orchards (Action 1404). Creating and restoring species-rich, semi-natural grassland results in increased pollinating insect density and diversity (Action 133). Planting grass buffer strips around arable or pasture fields increases arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity, with some margins providing benefits to bumblebees and other invertebrates (Action 246). Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, particularly for bumblebees (Action 14).

Planting nectar flower mixtures and wildflower strips increases butterfly and moth species richness and abundance compared to conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields (Action 3932). Sowing uncropped arable field margins with native wildflower seed mixes supports higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species (Action 19). Planting flowers generally increases pollinator numbers, with some flower species being more attractive to pollinators than others (Action 1406). Ground cover management in orchards and vineyards can support more bee species and pollen deposition compared to abandoned orchards (Action 1404). Creating and restoring species-rich, semi-natural grassland results in increased pollinating insect density and diversity (Action 133). Planting grass buffer strips around arable or pasture fields increases arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity, with some margins providing benefits to bumblebees and other invertebrates (Action 246). Providing grass strips at field margins can enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, particularly for bumblebees (Action 14).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for effects of different grazing management strategies on plant biodiversity in Mediterranean grasslands comes from several studies primarily conducted in Spain and other Mediterranean regions. Different grazing management strategies show varied effects on plant biodiversity:\n\n**Use of Grazers for Vegetation Management (Action 1419):** Studies in Spain and other regions found that grazing by cattle, sheep, or goats had mixed effects on plant abundance and diversity. Some studies found higher cover or abundance of certain plant groups in grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots, while others found lower cover or abundance of some plant groups. Regarding diversity, three studies found more plant species on grazed plots compared to ungrazed plots in some or all comparisons, with one study also finding fewer species of some plant groups and more non-native species on grazed plots. Two studies found no difference in the number of plant species between grazed and ungrazed plots.\n\n**Reduced Grazing Intensity (Action 1418):** Studies in Mediterranean-type climates including Israel found that lower grazing intensity by cattle or sheep resulted in higher cover of some plant species, herbaceous plants, or native plants compared to higher intensity grazing. However, some studies also found lower cover or biomass of certain plant groups with lower grazing intensity. Regarding diversity, most studies found no differences in plant diversity between sites with different cattle-grazing intensities, though one controlled study in wood pasture found fewer native species and more non-native species in paddocks with lower sheep-grazing intensities.\n\n**Seasonal Grazing (Action 1421):** Studies in Mediterranean regions including Israel found that the cover of native or non-native plants, or plant abundance, differed between sites grazed at different times in some comparisons. Two studies found differences in the number and/or diversity of plant species between plots grazed at different times.\n\n**Exclusion of Grazers (Action 1417):** Studies in Spain and other regions found that areas with cattle, sheep, goats, or alpacas excluded had higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups compared to grazed areas in most comparisons. However, some studies found lower biomass, cover, or abundance of certain plant groups in areas with grazers excluded. For diversity, results were mixed - some studies found more species in areas with grazers excluded, while others found fewer species or native species in excluded areas compared to grazed areas.\n\n**Type of Livestock (Action 3963):** One study found that semi-natural grasslands grazed by cattle had higher abundance and greater species richness of certain groups compared to grasslands grazed by sheep.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several effective practices can reduce nutrient loss from Mediterranean farmland soils into water. Reduced tillage practices (Action 1386) reduce water runoff and improve water infiltration rates while maintaining soil water content, and show less herbicide leaching compared to conventional tillage. Growing cover crops in arable fields (Action 1345) increases soil nitrogen retention and reduces soil erosion, with studies from Mediterranean-type climates showing higher organic matter content in soils with winter cover crops. Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards (Action 1382) significantly reduces water runoff, with studies from Chile, France, Italy, Spain, and the USA finding less sediment and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon) in runoff from plots with seeded cover crops compared to bare or tilled plots. Buffer strips (Action 1387) provide additional protection, with studies showing less nitrate in runoff from irrigated pastures with buffer strips and reduced sediment in runoff from fields with buffers. Soil amendments can also help - applying manures and agricultural composts (Action 911) reduces nutrient loss and water runoff when combined with other treatments, while application of nitrification inhibitors (Action 909) has been shown to reduce nitrate losses and nitrous oxide emissions in trials from New Zealand and the UK. Changing tillage practices (Action 906) more broadly shows reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage systems compared to conventional ploughing, with higher soil organic carbon retention that helps with nutrient management.",

Another study from France found more nematodes in soils with permanent ground cover compared to temporary ground cover in one of three comparisons (Action 1367). One study from Italy found the least erosion with permanent cover crops and the most erosion with temporary cover crops (Action 1367).\n\n**Water Outcomes**: One study from Spain found more water in soils with long-term cover crops compared to short-term in some comparisons (Action 1357).\n\nThe evidence base is limited, with most comparative studies between long-term and short-term cover crops coming from individual studies in France, Spain, and Italy.

    "relevant_summary": "Several management practices can improve soil fertility on Mediterranean farmland without adding amendments like manure or slurry. Crop rotation practices are effective, particularly including legumes in rotations, as studies from Canada, Portugal and Zambia found increased numbers of microbes and diversity of soil animals (857). Four studies from Australia, Canada, and Denmark found increased soil organic carbon under crop rotation, particularly when legumes were included (857). Cover crops grown beneath main crops or between crop rows also improve soil fertility, with two controlled trials from India and South Africa finding increased soil organic matter under cover crops (897). One study from Spain found that cover crops increased bacterial numbers and activity (897).\n\nReduced tillage practices offer another approach, with twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA finding higher soil organic carbon in soils under no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil (906). Eight studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage (906). Green manures provide additional benefits, with two controlled, randomized, replicated studies from India and Pakistan finding higher soil organic carbon when green manures were grown (908).\n\nAgroforestry systems, including alley cropping with trees, resulted in higher diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a study from Canada (903). Intercropping practices also contribute to soil health, with trials showing increased earthworm abundance in maize plots followed by rye grass crops (124). These practices collectively provide alternatives to manure amendments for maintaining and improving Mediterranean soil fertility through biological and physical soil management approaches.",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years).

Four replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found inconsistent differences in weeds with no tillage (Action 1397). One study from Lebanon found similar numbers of weeds in plots with or without tillage (Action 1397). When comparing no tillage to reduced tillage, four replicated, controlled studies from Italy, Lebanon, and Spain found fewer weeds in plots with no tillage compared to reduced tillage, while one study from Australia found more weeds with no tillage compared to reduced tillage (Action 1398). Regarding weed species diversity, two replicated, randomized, controlled studies from Spain and Turkey found similar numbers of weed species in plots with reduced tillage or conventional tillage (Action 1399). One study from the USA found that weed communities had different compositions in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1399). One study from Italy found more weed species in plots with no tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1397).

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage.

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several actions are effective for increasing beneficial soil organisms like earthworms and microbial biomass on Mediterranean farmland:\n\n**No-tillage and reduced tillage practices** are among the most effective approaches. No-tillage as main cultivation method (Action 2306) showed five replicated controlled studies from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in soils without tillage compared to soils with tillage in some or all comparisons, and two replicated studies from the USA found more earthworms in soils without tillage. Reduced tillage (Action 2307) demonstrated eleven replicated randomized controlled studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons, and one replicated site comparison from the USA found more earthworms in fields with fewer passes of the plough.\n\n**Cover crops** are highly effective for soil organisms. Cover crops in arable fields (Action 1345) showed five replicated randomized controlled studies from the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with cover crops compared to soils without them in some or all comparisons, one replicated controlled study found more earthworms in soils with winter cover crops, and one replicated randomized controlled study from Spain found more bacteria and fungi in soils with winter cover crops. Cover crops or ground cover in perennial crops (Action 2304) demonstrated four replicated studies from France and the USA found more microbial biomass in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils in some or all comparisons.\n\n**Organic amendments** enhance soil organisms. Using organic fertilizer instead of inorganic (Action 1366) showed four replicated studies from France, Italy, and Spain found more microbial biomass in soils with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some comparisons. Adding manure to soil (Action 1363) demonstrated five replicated controlled studies from Italy, Tunisia, Turkey, and the USA found more organic matter in soils with added manure. Amending soil with composts (Action 889) found one controlled randomized replicated trial in Italy showed applying a high rate of compost increased microbial biomass.\n\n**Microbial inoculation** can directly enhance soil organisms. Amending soil with bacteria or fungi (Action 888) showed one randomized replicated trial from India demonstrated adding soil bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi resulted in higher microbial diversity.\n\n**Crop rotations** show mixed results but can be beneficial. Using crop rotations (Action 1368) found one replicated controlled study from Italy showed more microbial biomass in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops in some comparisons, and one replicated randomized controlled study from Portugal found more fungi in soils with crop rotations.",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternative management practices can enhance crop quality on Mediterranean farmland beyond soil amendments. Reduced tillage practices show positive effects, with studies from Mediterranean countries including Egypt, France, Spain, and Turkey finding higher cereal yields in some or all comparisons, while studies from Italy and the USA found improved fruit and vegetable yields in irrigated plots (Action 1359). No-tillage systems provide additional benefits by increasing soil organic matter according to a meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries, while improving soil stability and reducing erosion (Action 1369). Crop rotation systems demonstrate effectiveness in reducing pest populations and crop diseases while increasing crop yield in some years, as shown in studies from Canada and the USA (Action 719). Cover crop cultivation helps manage water resources, with studies from Spain and the USA showing reduced water loss through drainage, runoff, or evaporation, while also reducing nitrate leaching from soils (Action 1357). Timing adjustments such as planting crops in spring rather than autumn can enhance productivity, with studies from Denmark, Sweden and the UK showing positive effects on crop systems (Action 137). Increasing crop diversity through rotation systems improves overall farm ecology, with studies from Belgium, Germany, Hungary and European countries reporting positive effects on ground beetles and plant species richness (Action 560). Competitive crop planting strategies help manage weeds naturally, with studies from Australia, Slovakia, the UK and the USA showing reduced weed plant weight and ground cover while reducing weed reproduction and survival (Action 722). Organic farming conversion provides comprehensive benefits, with experimental tests from Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia showing increased natural enemy populations, though effects on yields vary (Action 717).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Lebanon, no-tillage practices in arable fields show mixed effects across the key areas examined. \n\n**Crop Yield**: Studies show inconsistent results for crop yields under no-tillage systems. Eight studies from Italy and Spain found higher crop yields with no tillage compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, while seven studies from Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and the USA found lower crop yields with no tillage in some or all comparisons. Four studies from Italy and Spain found inconsistent differences (sometimes higher, sometimes lower yields), and three studies from Italy, Portugal, and Spain found similar yields between systems (Action 1355).\n\n**Soil Health**: No-tillage generally improves soil health indicators. One meta-analysis of studies from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils. Fourteen studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more organic matter with no-tillage in some or all comparisons. Seven studies from Spain and the USA found that no-tillage soils were more stable than tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Five studies from Italy and Spain found more microbial biomass in no-tillage soils, and two studies from the USA found more earthworms in no-tillage soils (Action 1369).\n\n**Water Availability**: No-tillage predominantly improves water availability. Nine controlled studies from Spain and the USA found more water in no-tillage soils compared to tilled soils in some or all comparisons. Only one study from Lebanon found less water in no-tillage soils in some comparisons. One study from Spain found that barley used water more efficiently in no-tillage plots compared to tilled plots in some comparisons (Action 1384).\n\n**Pest Numbers**: No-tillage effects on pest numbers are mixed, with weeds being the primary concern. Three studies from Italy and Spain found more weeds in no-tillage plots compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons, while four studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found inconsistent differences in weed numbers. One study from Italy found more weed species in no-tillage plots. However, one study from Italy found fewer parasitic plants (broomrapes) in no-tillage plots, and one study from Syria found no differences in most diseases between tillage systems (Action 1397).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several conservation actions can be implemented along watercourses on farmland to benefit biodiversity:\n\nRiparian buffer strips are the most studied action. Three studies from the Netherlands and the UK reported that providing buffer strips alongside watercourses had positive influences on plant, invertebrate and bird diversity or abundance, and supported vegetation associated with habitats preferred by water voles (Action 120). However, evidence is mixed as two replicated site comparison studies from France and Ireland found that riparian buffer strips on farms did not result in increased plant species numbers compared to farms without buffer strips (Action 120). One study found ground beetle diversity was higher in grazed riparian zones and narrow fenced strips than in wide riparian buffer strips, though wide buffer strips had ground beetle assemblages more distinct from adjacent pasture fields (Action 120).\n\nFor habitat restoration along watercourses, one replicated site comparison in the USA found similar amounts of water in soils in restored and remnant riparian habitats (Action 1388). However, evidence for amphibians is limited, with one replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819).\n\nCreating or restoring waterways showed some positive results. One site comparison study in the USA found that restored and pristine streams had similar turtle community composition and abundance (Action 3754). For wetland creation or restoration, studies from the USA found that created wetlands were used by various reptile species for reproduction and habitat use, though species richness and diversity results were mixed when comparing restored to undisturbed wetlands (Action 3755).\n\nLimited evidence exists for bat populations, with one study in the UK finding that pipistrelle activity did not differ along waterways with vegetation buffers on agri-environment scheme farms compared to conventional farms (Action 2284).\n\nNo studies were found evaluating the effects of preventing agricultural pollution from entering watercourses on biodiversity populations (Action 2015, 2882).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from Mediterranean countries and climates, several management actions show promise for mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions while others appear to be harmful.\n\nPROMISING MANAGEMENT ACTIONS:\nNo tillage systems demonstrate clear benefits. Studies from Spain found lower methane emissions and sometimes lower carbon dioxide emissions in soils without tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1369). A meta-analysis from Mediterranean countries found more organic matter in soils without tillage, which supports carbon sequestration (action 1369). Reduced tillage also shows benefits, with studies from Spain and other Mediterranean regions finding inconsistent but sometimes lower carbon dioxide emissions and generally increased soil organic matter compared to conventional tillage (action 1371).\n\nOrganic fertilizers instead of inorganic fertilizers show mixed but generally positive results. Studies from Spain found that soils with organic fertilizer sometimes absorbed more methane compared to inorganic fertilizer, and a meta-analysis found lower nitrous oxide emissions from organic fertilizer in some comparisons (action 1366). However, studies from Italy and Spain also found higher carbon dioxide emissions from organic fertilizer in some cases (action 1366).\n\nCover crops demonstrate consistent benefits. Studies from Italy and the USA found more carbon accumulation in soils with cover crops, though some studies also found higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in certain comparisons (action 1345). The carbon storage benefits generally outweigh the emission increases.\n\nExcluding grazers shows promise in some contexts. Studies from Spain found lower methane emissions in ungrazed wet grasslands compared to cattle-grazed areas, though carbon dioxide emissions were sometimes higher in ungrazed shrublands (action 1375).\n\nHARMFUL MANAGEMENT ACTIONS:\nAdding slurry to soil appears problematic for greenhouse gas emissions. Studies from Spain consistently found higher nitrous oxide emissions in soils with added slurry compared to soils without it, and two studies found higher carbon dioxide emissions (action 1365).\n\nAdding sewage sludge increases emissions. Studies from Spain and the USA found higher carbon dioxide emissions from soils with added sewage sludge compared to soils without it (action 1364).\n\nAdding compost shows mixed results but tends to increase emissions. Six studies from Italy, Spain, and the USA found more greenhouse gas emissions in soils with added compost compared to soils without it, though four studies found no differences (action 1362).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from multiple studies conducted in Mediterranean regions, several management practices beyond amendments can improve soil aggregation and stability:\n\n**Reduced Tillage Practices**: Studies from Spain found that soil aggregates had higher water-stability in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (Action 1371). Reduced tillage systems generally showed improved soil structure and aggregate stability in Mediterranean conditions.\n\n**No-Tillage Systems**: Mediterranean studies demonstrated that no-tillage provides enhanced soil water conservation and structural benefits compared to reduced tillage (Actions 1358, 1385). No-tillage practices help maintain soil aggregate structure by minimizing mechanical disturbance.\n\n**Cover Crops and Living Mulches**: Studies from Spain showed that growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increased soil stability and reduced erosion (Action 897). Cover crops provide continuous soil coverage that protects and stabilizes soil structure.\n\n**Ground Cover in Orchards and Vineyards**: Studies from Chile, Spain, and other Mediterranean regions found that soil aggregates were more water-stable in plots with seeded cover crops compared to tilled or bare soils (Action 1367). Ground cover systems consistently improved soil aggregation in perennial crop systems.\n\n**Mulching**: Studies from various locations including Spain found that adding mulch (whether straw, paper, or compost) increased soil stability and improved soil structure (Action 887). Mulch materials protect soil surface and enhance aggregate formation.\n\n**Crop Rotations**: One study from Syria found higher water-stability in soils with crop rotations compared to continuous crops, though results varied across different Mediterranean studies (Action 1368). Crop rotations can contribute to soil structural improvements through diverse root systems and reduced soil disturbance patterns.\n\n**Tillage Speed Management**: One study from Egypt found that tilling at slower tractor speeds resulted in less soil loss in runoff water (Action 1371), indicating that how tillage is performed affects soil stability.\n\nThese practices work by reducing soil disturbance, maintaining continuous soil cover, enhancing biological activity, and promoting the formation and preservation of stable soil aggregates through root activity and organic matter inputs.",

Reduced tillage systems generally showed improved soil structure and aggregate stability in Mediterranean conditions.\\n\\n**No-Tillage Systems**: Mediterranean studies demonstrated that no-tillage provides enhanced soil water conservation and structural benefits compared to reduced tillage (Actions 1358, 1385). No-tillage practices help maintain soil aggregate structure by minimizing mechanical disturbance.\\n\\n**Cover Crops and Living Mulches**: Studies from Spain showed that growing cover crops beneath main crops or between crop rows increased soil stability and reduced erosion (Action 897).
