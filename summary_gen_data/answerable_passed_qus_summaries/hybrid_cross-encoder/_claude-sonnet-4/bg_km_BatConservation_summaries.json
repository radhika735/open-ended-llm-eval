    "relevant_summary": "The evidence for strategies to combat white-nose syndrome in bats is extremely limited. Two studies evaluated treating bats with a probiotic bacterium to reduce white-nose syndrome infection, conducted in Canada and the USA (2008). One randomized, controlled study in Canada found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium at the time of infection with white-nose syndrome increased survival within cages in a laboratory, and that these bats had reduced symptoms of the disease (2008). However, bats treated 21 days prior to infection had worse symptoms (2008). One randomized, controlled study in the USA found that treating little brown bats with a probiotic bacterium within a mine increased survival for free-flying bats, but not caged bats (2008). The same USA study found that little brown bats kept within cages in a mine and treated with a probiotic bacterium had a similar severity of white-nose syndrome to untreated bats (2008). For all other strategies including culling infected bats (1012), vaccination against the pathogen (1011), breeding bats in captivity to supplement affected populations (2009), restricting human access to caves (1010), treating hibernacula environments to reduce pathogen reservoirs (2007), and decontaminating equipment to reduce pathogen spread (2006), no studies were found that evaluated their effectiveness on bat populations.",
