    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for conservation actions designed to mitigate commercial logging impacts on primate populations is extremely limited. Only one action has empirical evidence: using selective logging instead of clear-cutting (Action 1485). One site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest logged at low intensity than in forest logged at high intensity. One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging. However, one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity. For all other commonly proposed mitigation measures, there is no empirical evidence available. These include: using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas (Action 1497), reducing forestry team sizes to employees only (Action 1499), certifying forest concessions as 'primate friendly' (Action 1500), closing non-essential roads after logging (Action 1496), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (Action 1495), providing domestic meat to workers to reduce hunting (Action 1501), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (Action 1487), avoiding slashing climbers/lianas and important vegetation (Action 1493), implementing road blocks to inspect for illegal bushmeat (Action 1470), thinning trees within forests (Action 1491), and employing hunters in conservation (Action 1484). Related evidence from Action 3867 shows effects of selective/reduced impact logging on butterflies and moths but not specifically primates.
