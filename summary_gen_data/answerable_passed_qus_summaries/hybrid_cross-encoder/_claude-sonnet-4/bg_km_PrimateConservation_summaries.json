    "relevant_summary": "The evidence base for conservation actions designed to mitigate commercial logging impacts on primate populations is extremely limited. Only one action has empirical evidence: using selective logging instead of clear-cutting (Action 1485). One site comparison in Sierra Leone found that primate densities were higher in forest logged at low intensity than in forest logged at high intensity. One before-and-after study in Madagascar found that the number of lemurs increased following selective logging. However, one site comparison study in Uganda found that primate densities were similar in forest logged at low intensity and forest logged at high intensity. For all other commonly proposed mitigation measures, there is no empirical evidence available. These include: using set-asides for primate protection within logging areas (Action 1497), reducing forestry team sizes to employees only (Action 1499), certifying forest concessions as 'primate friendly' (Action 1500), closing non-essential roads after logging (Action 1496), incorporating forested corridors or buffers into logged areas (Action 1495), providing domestic meat to workers to reduce hunting (Action 1501), implementing small and dispersed logging compartments (Action 1487), avoiding slashing climbers/lianas and important vegetation (Action 1493), implementing road blocks to inspect for illegal bushmeat (Action 1470), thinning trees within forests (Action 1491), and employing hunters in conservation (Action 1484). Related evidence from Action 3867 shows effects of selective/reduced impact logging on butterflies and moths but not specifically primates.

One study in Rwanda found that the number of immature mountain gorillas increased by 22% and the number of snares declined by 30% after a tourism project was initiated, alongside other interventions (Action 1512). One study in Belize found that numbers of black howler monkeys increased by 138% over 13 years after a tourism project was implemented, alongside other interventions (Action 1512). One study found that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while being visited by researchers and tourists whose clothes were disinfected, alongside other interventions (Action 1547). One review in Japan found that aggressive interactions between Japanese macaques and humans declined after prohibiting tourists from feeding of monkeys (Action 1507).\n\nHarms documented include: One study in China found that implementing an intensive tourism project for Tibetan macaques that included food provisioning and range restrictions, increased their stress levels compared to previous periods, with infant mortality reaching 100% in some years (Action 1512). One study in Madagascar found that after implementing a tourism project the population size and/or body size and group size declined for two lemur species but the number of individuals increased for one other lemur species (Action 1512). One study in Kenya found that numbers of Tana River red colobus and crested mangabeys decreased despite implementing a tourism project, alongside other interventions (Action 1512). One controlled study in Malaysia found that a population of reintroduced orangutans decreased by 33% over 33 years despite staff and volunteers having received medical checks, alongside other interventions (Action 1546).",

One study in Uganda found that a reintroduced chimpanzee repeatedly returned to human settlements after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present, while a study in Senegal found that a reintroduced chimpanzee was reunited with its mother (Action 1591). One study in Malaysia found that a majority of reintroduced orangutans survived reintroduction into habitat where the species was present, although one controlled study in Malaysia found that a reintroduced population of orangutans had declined 33 years after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present (Action 1591). Population outcomes vary by species and location: one study in Belize found that primate population increased five years after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present, while one study in Thailand found that primate population declined post-reintroduction (Action 1591). Survival rates show mixed results: six studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Indonesia, Madagascar, and South Africa found that a minority of primates survived for at least fifteen weeks to seven years after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present, while five studies in Brazil, French Guiana, Gabon, and South Africa found that a majority of primates survived for at least two months to one year (Action 1591). Behavioral integration appears positive: two controlled studies in Madagascar and Indonesia found that reintroduced primates had similar diets to individuals in wild populations after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present, and one controlled study in Indonesia found that reintroduced primates showed similar behavior to wild individuals after reintroduction into habitat where the species was present (Action 1591).

A before-and-after study in Belize found that a black howler monkey population increased after the construction of pole bridges over man-made gaps (Action 1457). A before-and-after study in Madagascar found that all six monitored lemur species used bridges to cross roads and pipelines (Action 1457).\n\n**Rope Bridges Between Canopies:** Nine studies found that rope bridges were used by a range of mammals, with seven studies finding between three and 25 species using rope bridges (Action 2556). One study found that crossing rates were higher over the canopy bridges than at ground level (Action 2556). A study in Australia found that arboreal marsupials using rope bridges did not suffer high predation rates when doing so (Action 2556).\n\n**Green Bridges (Overpasses):** No evidence was found for the effects of installing green bridges specifically on primate populations (Action 1456). However, general mammal overpass studies showed that overpasses were used by a wide range of mammals and reduced collisions between vehicles and mammals when combined with roadside fencing (Action 2526).\n\n**Pole Crossings:** While primarily studied for gliders and flying squirrels, six studies found that poles were used for crossing roads by arboreal mammals, and one study found that arboreal marsupials using artificial road crossing structures did not suffer high predation rates (Action 2546).\n\nThe evidence indicates that rope and pole bridges show positive results for arboreal primates specifically, while green bridges lack direct evidence for primate effectiveness despite success with other mammal species.",

Personal protective equipment measures include wearing face-masks to avoid transmission of viral and bacterial diseases to primates (Action 1537), and wearing gloves when handling primate food and tool items (Action 1548). Hygiene protocols involve regularly disinfecting clothes and boots (Action 1547). Health screening requires ensuring that researchers and tourists are up-to-date with vaccinations and healthy, with sick or unwell individuals not allowed to visit primates (Action 1546). Physical distancing measures include keeping safety distances to habituated animals (Action 1538) and limiting the time that researchers and tourists are allowed to spend with habituated animals (Action 1539). Additional protective measures include implementing a no-feeding policy for wild primates (Action 1502) and avoiding contact between wild primates and human-raised primates (Action 1555). Site management approaches include implementing continuous health monitoring with permanent veterinary staff on site (Action 1554) and implementing health programmes for local communities (Action 1557). One before-and-after study in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo found that mountain gorilla numbers increased by 168% over 41 years while multiple interventions including face-masks, restricted visit times, clothes disinfection, health screening, safety distances, and continuous veterinary monitoring were implemented together.",

    "relevant_summary": "Research on primate supplementary feeding strategies reveals varied outcomes depending on the approach used. Regular continuous feeding shows mixed results, with studies in China and The Gambia finding population increases after regular supplementary food provision alongside other interventions (Action 1526), while studies in Thailand and Malaysia found population declines under the same conditions (Action 1526). The majority of primates survived after being regularly provided supplementary food in studies from Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia (Action 1526), and in Liberia the majority of introduced chimpanzees survived for at least one year (Action 1526). However, one controlled study in Madagascar found that introduced black-and-white ruffed lemurs showed different diets compared to wild groups after a year of regular food supplementation (Action 1526).\n\nTime-limited feeding strategies also show variable results. One study in Tanzania found a chimpanzee population increased after two months of supplementary feeding immediately after reintroduction (Action 1528), while a study in Brazil found golden lion tamarin populations declined after one year following supplementary feeding (Action 1528). Four studies in Brazil, Madagascar, and South Africa found only a minority of reintroduced primates survived after supplementary feeding (Action 1528), though studies in Guinea, Gabon, South Africa and Vietnam found majority survival rates (Action 1528). Two studies in Gabon and the Republic of Congo found majority survival of lowland gorillas for nine months to four years after supplementary food provision (Action 1528).\n\nResource-scarce period feeding appears more effective. One study in the Republic of Congo found the majority of chimpanzees survived for at least five years after supplementary feeding during resource scarce periods (Action 1527), one study in Kenya found wild olive baboons survived for at least 17 years after supplementary feeding in drought periods (Action 1527), and one controlled study in Madagascar found black-and-white ruffed lemurs maintained diets similar to wild individuals after supplementary feeding in resource scarce periods (Action 1527).\n\nDietary composition also affects outcomes. Replacing milk with fruit juice in gorilla diets led to decreased regurgitation and reingestion (Action 1329), and feeding lemurs a fruit-free diet resulted in lower aggression and self-directed behavior (Action 1329). Social feeding strategies showed that enrichment tasks took less time when monkeys were in social groups versus feeding alone (Action 1343), and monkeys ate more unfamiliar foods in the presence of groupmates (Action 1343). Implementing no-feeding policies resulted in declining Japanese macaque population sizes and productivity after limiting and prohibiting food provisioning (Action 1502).",

For the direct actions of compensating farmers for produce loss caused by primates (Action 1428) and paying farmers to cover the costs of non-harmful strategies to deter primates (Action 1429), no evidence was found for their effects on primate populations. While general financial conservation payments to farmers have been studied for other taxa, such as amphibians where three studies in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations (Action 818), and for birds where twenty-two of 25 studies from Europe found that at least some birds studied were at higher densities or had higher population levels on sites with agri-environment schemes compared to non-agri-environment scheme sites (Action 172), there appears to be a significant research gap specifically regarding the effectiveness of financial incentives for primate conservation in agricultural landscapes.",

When translocating primates from development sites, the majority of orangutans in Malaysia survived following translocation to natural habitat alongside other interventions (action 1558). Three studies in Tanzania, French Guiana, and Madagascar found that a majority of primates survived for 5-30 months following translocation from development sites to natural habitat alongside other interventions, though one study in French Guiana found that a minority of primates survived for at least 18 months (action 1558). In India, rhesus monkeys remained at the sites where they were released following translocation from a development site to natural habitat alongside other interventions (action 1558).
