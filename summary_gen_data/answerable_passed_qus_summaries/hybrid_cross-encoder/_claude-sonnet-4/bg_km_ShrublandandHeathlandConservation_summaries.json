According to action 105, one systematic review found that the herbicide asulam reduced bracken abundance if applied repeatedly, but cutting may be equally effective.

For cutting alone, action 1653 shows that one randomized, controlled, before-and-after trial in Norway and two randomized, controlled studies in the UK found that cutting bracken reduced bracken cover or biomass, while one controlled study in the UK found that cutting bracken did not decrease the abundance of bracken. The combination approach showed promise, with action 1654 reporting that three randomized, controlled studies in the UK and Norway found that cutting and applying herbicide reduced bracken biomass or cover. Additionally, action 1654 found that one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK showed that cutting bracken followed by applying herbicide increased plant species richness when compared with applying herbicide followed by cutting, suggesting the order of treatment matters. Regarding effects on heather recovery, action 1652 found mixed results for herbicide alone with some studies showing increased heather biomass and seedlings while others showed no increase in heather cover. Action 1653 similarly showed mixed results for cutting, with some studies finding increased heather cover or biomass while others found no increase. The combination approach in action 1654 showed one study where cutting and applying herbicide did not alter heather biomass in the UK, but increased heather cover in Norway.",

Studies from the UK found that using fences to exclude livestock increased shrub cover or abundance, increased shrub biomass or the biomass and height of individual heather plants, and found that heather presence or cover was higher in fenced areas (Action 1545). Similarly, studies in Germany found that using fences increased shrub biomass (Action 1545). However, one site comparison study in the USA found that using fences led to decreased cover of woody plants, and three replicated, controlled studies in the USA and UK found that fencing either had a mixed effect on shrub cover or did not alter shrub cover (Action 1545). In broader grazing exclusion studies across multiple countries, fifteen studies in grasslands, shrublands deserts, and mixed habitats in the USA, Israel, Chile, Spain, and Australia found higher biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups in areas with cattle, sheep, goats, or alpacas excluded compared to grazed areas (Action 2292). However, two studies from Australia found lower biomass, cover, or abundance of some or all plant groups in areas with grazers excluded compared to grazed areas, and five replicated, controlled studies in grasslands in the USA found no difference in the cover of plants between ungrazed and grazed areas (Action 2292).",

While there is some evidence for related mitigation strategies in other contexts, such as tunnels and culverts for mammals where seventeen of 20 studies found that crossing structures beneath roads were used by mammals (Action 2514), and one study in Italy found that restoring connectivity between wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840), these findings do not specifically address shrubland ecosystems.
