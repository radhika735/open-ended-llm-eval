For sea lice control specifically, cleaner wrasse (corkwing and goldskinny species) can be as effective as chemical treatments, though rockcook cleaner wrasse were found to be ineffective (Action 738). Altering lighting conditions can reduce lice numbers, with lower intensity artificial light or natural lighting resulting in fewer lice compared to more intense artificial lighting (Action 741). Dietary modifications using probiotics and immunostimulants can reduce lice infection levels by 28%, and adding beta-glucans to diets can decrease infection levels by an additional 28% (Action 732). For disease control, vaccinations provide higher survival rates against various bacterial diseases including Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, marine flexibacteriosis, bacterial kidney disease, and infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Breeding for resistance traits increases survival levels when salmon are exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 735). Fallowing systems reduce lice numbers on Atlantic salmon (Action 1026). Environmental modifications include using larger cage sizes to reduce amoebic gill disease levels (Action 742) and aerobic training, particularly interval training, to improve survival rates against infectious pancreatic necrosis (Action 740). Freshwater bathing shows mixed results for reducing amoebic gill disease, with some studies showing reduction in amoebae numbers persisting for up to 10 days while others show no difference (Action 739).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several interventions have been shown to increase survival rates of farmed salmon exposed to disease. Vaccinations appear highly effective, with controlled studies from Iceland and Norway showing higher survival rates in vaccinated salmon compared to unvaccinated control groups after exposure to disease-causing bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida spp.achromogenes and Yersinia ruckeri (Action 733). Additional controlled studies in Australia and Canada reported higher survival in salmon infected with marine flexibacteriosis and bacterial kidney disease following vaccination, and two controlled studies in Norway reported similar positive results for salmon vaccinated against infectious salmon anaemia (Action 733). Aerobic training shows promise, with a study in Norway finding higher survival rates in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when they had undergone aerobic training, with interval training being more effective than continuous training (Action 740). Breeding for resistance traits also demonstrates effectiveness, as a controlled study in Norway found increased survival levels in salmon exposed to infectious pancreatic necrosis when families were bred for high resistance compared to families bred for low resistance (Action 735). Probiotics and immunostimulants show potential, with a study in Scotland finding increased survival in salmon fed probiotics before exposure to four different disease-causing bacteria over 28 days compared to controls (Action 732). Environmental management approaches also show benefits: larger cage sizes resulted in lower levels of amoebic gill disease compared to smaller cages in Australian studies (Action 742), while altered lighting conditions, specifically low intensity artificial light or natural lighting, resulted in lower numbers of lice on salmon compared to more intense artificial light in Norwegian studies (Action 741).",
