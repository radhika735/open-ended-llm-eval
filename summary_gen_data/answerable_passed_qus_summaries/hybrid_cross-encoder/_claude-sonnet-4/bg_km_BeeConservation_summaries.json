    "relevant_summary": "Based on replicated trials in Europe, the most effective methods for managing uncropped field margins to support bumblebees include: Sowing margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, which attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Five replicated trials in the UK demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes and subsequently mown support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species (Action 19). Leaving field margins uncropped with natural regeneration also provides benefits, with four replicated UK trials finding more bumblebees and bee species foraging on uncropped margins than cropped margins, though the value varies year to year and relies on thistle species considered pernicious weeds (Action 20). Agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes at least in the first year, though margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Grassy field margins show mixed results, with one trial showing 6m wide grassy margins enhancing bumblebee abundance and diversity within margins (Action 14). Grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins in spring (Action 12). Conservation headlands (unsprayed areas within crops) do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (Action 29).",
