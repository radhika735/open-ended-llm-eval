    "relevant_summary": "Based on replicated trials in Europe, the most effective methods for managing uncropped field margins to support bumblebees include: Sowing margins with agricultural nectar and pollen mixes containing perennial leguminous flowering plants, which attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Five replicated trials in the UK demonstrated that uncropped field margins sown with native wild flower seed mixes and subsequently mown support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated uncropped margins, with perennial leguminous herbs being particularly important forage sources for long-tongued bumblebee species (Action 19). Leaving field margins uncropped with natural regeneration also provides benefits, with four replicated UK trials finding more bumblebees and bee species foraging on uncropped margins than cropped margins, though the value varies year to year and relies on thistle species considered pernicious weeds (Action 20). Agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes at least in the first year, though margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value and require re-sowing every few years (Action 18). Grassy field margins show mixed results, with one trial showing 6m wide grassy margins enhancing bumblebee abundance and diversity within margins (Action 14). Grassy field margins attract nest-searching queen bumblebees at higher densities than cropped margins in spring (Action 12). Conservation headlands (unsprayed areas within crops) do not attract more foraging bumblebees than conventional crop fields (Action 29).",

However, one of these studies only found this effect in one of two study years. Two of these studies also found that the abundance of specialist butterflies\\u00a0and meadow brown caterpillars\\u00a0was similar in sown wildflower strips and unsown margins, cropped fields\\u00a0and conventional grassland, and one found that the abundance of caterpillars was lower in sown wildflower strips than in conventional grassland. One replicated, randomized, paired, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that the abundance of butterflies and micro-moths was higher on farms managed under agri-environment schemes, including with sown wildflower strips, than on conventionally managed farms, but the abundance of other moths was similar. Two replicated studies (including one randomized, controlled study and one site comparison study) in the UK\\u00a0and Sweden\\u00a0found that field margins sown with wildflowers had a higher abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins. One replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK\\u00a0found that farms with wildflower strips (along with other enhanced agri-environment scheme options) had a higher abundance of some butterflies, but a lower abundance of other butterflies, than farms with simpler agri-environment scheme management such as grass-only margins.

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.

    "relevant_summary": "Several key actions can support wild bee populations in urban areas and along infrastructure corridors based on the available evidence. \n\nStop using herbicides on pavements and road verges, as studies found that restored roadside prairies where herbicide application was restricted had greater butterfly abundance and species richness, with lower mortality risk than areas with unrestricted herbicide use (Action 3899). \n\nManage land under power lines for wildlife, as one study found more bee species under power lines managed as scrub than in equivalent areas of annually mown grassland (Action 31). Land under power lines managed by mechanical cutting also showed higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than unmanaged land, with butterfly species richness highest 2-4 years after scrub and trees were cleared (Action 3855).\n\nAlter mowing regimes on greenspaces and road verges, since less frequently mown or unmown urban greenspaces had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than more frequently mown areas. Less frequently mown road verges and verges mown later in summer also had fewer dead butterflies than those mown more frequently or earlier (Action 3841).\n\nEstablish green infrastructure in urban areas, though evidence shows green roofs had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies than urban parks, but older green roofs with more nectar plant species in larger areas had higher butterfly abundance (Action 3837).\n\nRestore or maintain species-rich grassland along road/railway verges, as restored roadside prairies and verges sown with native wildflowers, more butterfly species' larval food plants, and more plant species had higher species richness and diversity of butterflies and moths than verges dominated by non-native vegetation. Wide road verges also had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies than narrow road verges (Action 3854).\n\nPlant nectar flower mixtures/wildflower strips, since sown wildflower strips had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than conventional field margins, unsown margins, and cropped fields. Field margins sown with wildflowers had greater species richness and abundance of butterflies than grass-only field margins (Action 3932).\n\nAdditional pollinator support can be provided by planting flowers, as planted flower strips supported more wild bee species and individuals compared to unplanted strips, and more pollinators visited crops near planted flower strips (Action 1406). Reduce cutting frequency on grassland, as meadows cut once per year had higher species richness of butterflies and pollinators than meadows cut multiple times per year (Action 3961). Rear and manage populations of solitary bees, as local populations can increase up to six-fold in one year under management with good conditions and plentiful floral resources (Action 54).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the documented evidence, several outcomes and challenges have been identified for rearing bumblebees in captivity for reintroduction purposes. \n\nRegarding captive rearing outcomes, 22 trials from 13 countries have documented various approaches to captive rearing including confining mated queens alone, with bumblebee workers, honey bee workers, male bumblebee pupae, or following CO2 anaesthetisation (Action 50). Success has been variable by species - two trials successfully induced spring queens of half-black bumblebee B. vagans to rear adults in captivity, and one trial induced queen yellow-banded bumblebees B. terricola and red-belted bumblebees B. rufocinctus to rear adults in captivity (Action 50). However, significant challenges emerged with some North American declining species, as all three trials attempting to rear yellow bumblebee B. fervidus resulted in queens laying eggs but larvae dying before becoming adults, with the same pattern observed for rusty-patched bumblebee and American bumblebee B. pensylvanicus (Action 50).\n\nEnvironmental factors significantly impact success rates. Pollen diet influences reproductive success, with buff-tailed bumblebee B. terrestris colonies fed on freshly frozen pollen producing larger queens that survived better than those fed dried, frozen pollen (Action 50). Artificial light regimes of eight hours light, 16 hours darkness can reduce egg-laying time compared to constant darkness (Action 50). Hibernation protocols also affect outcomes - queens hibernated at 4-5\u00b0C for 45 days showed enhanced egg-laying and colony formation rates but produced smaller colonies than non-hibernated queens, and queens should weigh more than 0.6g and be hibernated for four months or less for good survival chances (Action 50).\n\nReintroduction challenges include variable reproductive success, with seven replicated trials showing mixed results - in two UK trials, numbers of queens per colony were very low or zero, while two other trials produced good numbers of new queens (Action 52). Social parasitism by cuckoo bees presents a significant challenge, with variable rates ranging from 25-79% in some trials, though parasitism can be reduced by placing colonies in landscapes with intermediate nectar and pollen availability and releasing late in the season rather than early (Action 52). Supplementary feeding effects are inconsistent - one Canadian trial found it improved reproductive success but didn't reduce parasite load, while a US trial found no increase in colony productivity (Action 52).\n\nLong-term captive rearing may also present challenges, as one trial found that over four years of artificial rearing, Bombus terrestris queens gradually decreased in weight (Action 50).",

Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) represents another risk in commercial bumblebee colonies, which can be controlled using the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Aizawai strain at a concentration of 1 g Bt/litre of water (Action 42).\n\nThe small hive beetle poses a significant threat during commercial honey bee transport, with research showing that more than half the beetles escaped from commercial Apis mellifera transport packages even when mite-killing strips were used for control (Action 41). \n\nFor solitary bee management, several species in the family Megachilidae are reared commercially as pollinators for alfalfa and fruit trees, nesting in drilled wooden blocks or stacked grooved boards. However, parasites and pathogens are problematic in these operations, requiring the development of various control methods (Action 54). When rearing solitary bees artificially, high larval mortality occurs when Osmia cornuta is fed artificial pollen-based diets, including honey bee-collected pollen, while Megachile rotundata can be successfully reared on artificial diets based on honey bee-collected pollen, though synthetic pollen substitutes result in either death or low pre-pupal weight (Action 54).",

In contrast, Action 31 found that power line management in Maryland, USA resulted in more bee species under power lines managed as scrub than in equivalent areas of annually mown grassland. Action 24 provides additional context that the Scottish Rural Stewardship Scheme was among European agri-environment schemes that showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees, though broader UK trials found bumblebee populations were not enhanced on farmland managed under agri-environment schemes.

Fourteen studies (one replicated) in South Africa, the USA, the Netherlands, Italy, France\\u00a0and Spain found that following translocation, populations of warthogs, Eurasian beavers, red squirrels, roe deer, Alpine ibex, Iberian ibex, Cape mountain zebra, 22 species of grazing mammals, black bears, brown bear, bobcats\\u00a0and most populations of river otters\\u00a0increased. Two reviews in South Africa\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that reintroductions (mainly through translocations) led to increasing populations for four of six species of large carnivores\\u00a0and that over half of translocations were classified as successful. One replicated study in the USA and Mexico\\u00a0found that translocating desert bighorn sheep did not increase the population size. Two studies (one replicated) and a review in USA and Canada, the USA\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that translocated American martens, and sea otters\\u00a0at four of seven sites, established populations and that translocated and released captive-bred macropod species\\u00a0established populations in 44 of 72 cases.

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence from multiple studies demonstrates that sown floral mixes on agricultural land have positive effects on wild bees, particularly bumblebees, though evidence for solitary bees is limited. Five replicated trials in Europe documented bumblebees foraging on field margins sown with agricultural nectar and pollen seed mixes (Action 18). Four replicated trials showed that field margins sown with perennial leguminous flowering plants attract significantly more foraging bumblebees than naturally regenerated, grassy, or cropped field margins (Action 18). Three replicated trials demonstrated that agricultural forage plant mixes including legumes attract greater numbers of bumblebees than perennial wildflower mixes, at least in the first year (Action 18). \n\nFive replicated trials in the UK showed that uncropped field margins sown with wild flowers support higher abundance and species richness of foraging bumblebees than cropped field edges, grassy margins, or naturally regenerated margins (Action 19). Perennial leguminous herbs in seed mixtures are important forage sources for bumblebees, particularly for long-tongued species (Action 19). One trial showed that long-tongued bumblebee species strongly preferred perennial wildflower seed mix over annual forage plants (Action 19).\n\nFourteen trials in Europe and North America recorded substantial numbers of wild bees foraging on sown flowering plants in agricultural environments (Action 17). Ten trials monitored bees foraging on patches with high proportion of phacelia, with all but one finding substantial numbers of foraging wild bees, particularly bumblebees, with species numbers ranging from eight to 35 (Action 17). A comprehensive review of 80 studies found that of 65 studies examining effects on invertebrates, fifty reported positive effects of flower strips on invertebrate abundance, species richness, or diversity (Action 442).\n\nHowever, important limitations exist: three trials in the UK found that margins sown with agricultural legume plants degrade in value to bumblebees and would need re-sowing every few years (Action 18). No evidence was captured on the effects of field margin management on solitary bees in multiple studies (Actions 18, 19). Two trials in Germany found no or relatively few species of solitary bee nesting on set-aside fields sown with phacelia or clover (Action 17). One large trial showed that bee numbers and species richness were not higher in farmland 50-1,500 m away from planted flower patches (Action 17).",

However, no evidence has been captured for the effect of creating areas of bare ground on bee populations or communities on a larger scale (Action 13).\n\nRegarding tillage practices, evidence on whether reduced tillage or no tillage benefits ground-nesting bees is mixed. Two replicated trials on squash farms in the USA had contrasting results - one showed no difference in bee abundance between tilled and untilled farms, while the other found three times more squash bees on no-till farms than on conventional farms (Action 11).\n\nFor grazing management, one replicated trial showed that reducing the intensity of summer cattle grazing can increase the abundance, but not the species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps (Action 23).\n\nArtificial nest sites have shown success, with 30 replicated trials of nest boxes for solitary bees in 10 countries showing that 29 trials had occupancy by bees, including some endangered species (Action 47). However, one small replicated trial testing soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK found they were not occupied (Action 47).\n\nFour replicated trials in Europe showed enhanced diversity and/or abundance of foraging wild bees on land managed under various European agri-environment schemes, relative to conventionally-managed fields, though four other trials found that bee numbers and/or species were not enhanced under such schemes (Action 24).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes. In one trial, these introduced species more commonly occupied the boxes than native bees.\\nA small trial tested three soil-filled nest boxes for the mining bee Andrena flavipes in the UK, but they were not occupied.\"\n}"

Restricting certain pesticides has been shown to prevent negative impacts, with one study in Italy demonstrating that a reduction in solitary bee species associated with repeated applications of the insecticide fenitrothion can be avoided by not applying the insecticide (Action 26). Converting to organic farming shows mixed evidence, with three replicated trials in Europe or Canada demonstrating higher abundance of wild bees under organic arable farming than conventional farming, though other trials found no significant differences in bee numbers between conventional and organic farms (Action 25). Reducing pesticide or herbicide use generally has been studied, with one trial in the USA showing that numbers of foraging bees on squash farms are not affected by responsible pesticide use (Action 27). Altering the timing of insecticide use has been evaluated, though the available evidence focuses on effects on natural enemies, pests, and crop yields rather than specifically on wild bees (Action 723). Using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach threshold levels has been studied for its effects on natural enemies and pest control, with one study in Finland finding that threshold-based spraying increased numbers of natural enemies (Action 750). Stopping the use of pesticides as seed dressings and sprays in flower beds and greenspace has been studied for butterflies, with one study in France finding higher butterfly abundance in gardens where insecticides and herbicides were not used (Action 3900).",

Nest box design and materials significantly impact success rates - reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees per nest than other types, while nest boxes with plastic-lined holes or plastic/paper tubes were much less productive due to parasitism or mould (Action ID: 47). Distance to foraging resources is critical, with nest boxes needing to be within 150-600 meters of foraging areas based on European studies that also inform USA practices (Action ID: 47). Invasive species pose a significant threat - in California trials, introduced European earwigs and introduced European leafcutter bee species commonly occupied nest boxes, sometimes more frequently than native bees (Action ID: 47). However, using sticky barriers like Tanglefoot to exclude European earwigs increased native bee usage of nest boxes (Action ID: 44). Population growth potential is substantial - one USA study in blueberry fields showed estimated numbers of foraging Osmia bees increased in fields with nest boxes compared to fields without boxes, and trials with Osmia species demonstrated that occupied nest numbers can double over three years with repeated nest box provision (Action ID: 47). Mortality and parasitism rates vary considerably, ranging from as low as 2% of bee brood cells attacked in some studies to over 50% mortality in others depending on location and conditions (Action ID: 47).",

Twenty-nine of these trials showed occupancy by bees. Many species of solitary bee readily nest in the boxes, including some species considered endangered in a study on farmland in Germany, oil-collecting species of the genus Centris in South America and a recently discovered species in lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica. One trial in temperate forest in Canada recorded no bees using nest boxes.\\nA set of replicated experiments in Germany estimated that four medium to large European species of solitary bee have a foraging range of 150 to 600 m, so nest boxes must be within this distance of foraging resources.\\nTwenty-three replicated trials have shown nest boxes of cut hollow stems or tubes being occupied by solitary bees. Eleven trials demonstrated occupation of blocks of wood drilled with holes. Two trials in Neotropical secondary forest (one in Brazil, one in Mexico) showed that particular solitary bee species will nest in wooden boxes, without stems or confining walls inside.\\nTwo replicated trials have compared reproductive success in different nest box designs. One showed that reed stem and wooden grooved-board nest boxes produced more bees/nest than four other types. Nest boxes with plastic-lined holes, or plastic or paper tubes were much less productive, due to parasitism or mould. The other, a small trial, found nests of the oil-collecting bee Centris analis in Brazil were more productive in cardboard straws placed in drilled wooden holes than in grooved wooden boards stacked together.\\nThree trials on agricultural land, one on a carpenter bee in India, one on a range of species in Germany and one on species of Osmia in the USA, have shown that the number of occupied solitary bee nests can double over three years with repeated nest box provision at a given site.\\nOne small replicated trial compared populations of solitary bees in blueberry fields in the USA with and without nest boxes over three years. The estimated number of foraging Osmia bees had increased in fields with nest boxes, compared to fields without nest boxes.\\nEleven replicated trials have recorded solitary bees in nest boxes being attacked by parasites or predators. Rates of mortality and parasitism have been measured in 10 studies. Mortality rates range from 13% mortality for cavity-nesting bees and wasps combined in Germany (2% were successfully parasitized), or 2% of bee brood cells attacked in shade coffee and cacao plantations in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, to 36% parasitism and 20% other mortality (56% mortality overall) for the subtropical carpenter bee Xylocopa fenestrata in India.\\nTwo replicated trials of the use of drilled wooden nest boxes by bees in California, USA, showed that introduced European earwigs Forficula auricularia and introduced European leafcutter bee species use the boxes.
