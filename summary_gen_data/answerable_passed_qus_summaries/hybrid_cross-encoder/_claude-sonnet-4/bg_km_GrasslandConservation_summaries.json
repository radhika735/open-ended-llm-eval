Adding sulphur to soil before seeding reduced plant species richness in one study but showed no change in another study. Adding sulphur before sowing reduced overall vegetation cover but increased the cover of three of six sown species when applied in low amounts. Native plant species cover and richness were not altered by sulphur addition (Action 3428). When sulphur was added alongside sowing, it did not increase heather cover in most cases and had mixed effects on various grass species. However, adding sulphur alongside planting heather seedlings increased their survival, though survival remained very low after two years (Action 1710).",

Mowing after seeding/planting has been found to increase plant species richness compared to grazing with livestock in one UK study (Action 3419). Additionally, mowing after sowing seeds increased the richness of sown species in another UK study, and cutting sown plots each year with removal of cut vegetation increased sown grass and forb species richness compared to cutting without removing vegetation (Action 3419). Mowing after sowing also increased the abundance of sown forb species in one UK study and increased the abundance of five of seven sown forb species when mowing was more frequent in a German study (Action 3419). In contrast, livestock grazing after seeding showed mixed results for sown species enhancement. One UK study found that grazing with cattle after sowing seeds increased sown species richness compared to grazing with sheep, but another UK study found that grazing with cattle reduced the cover of sown species compared to grazing with sheep (Action 3423). However, one Italian study found that grazing with livestock after sowing seeds increased plant species richness compared to sowing without grazing (Action 3423). The evidence suggests that annual mowing after sowing can increase plant community similarity to natural grassland and that cutting vegetation three times per year after sowing increased the richness of characteristic grassland species compared to cutting once per year (Action 3419).",

For mechanical site preparation through vegetation removal, five studies found no effect of controlling understory vegetation on the emergence, survival, growth rate or frost damage in planted seedlings, though one found removing competing herbs increased seedling biomass and one found that removal of sheep laurel shrubs increased growth rate and height of planted black spruce seedlings (Action 1256).\n\nFor creating mounds or hollows, one study in Brazil reported that planting tree seedlings into mounds had mixed effects on survival over three years depending on the species, with tree seedlings planted into mounds typically growing at a similar rate to seedlings planted at ground level (Action 3289). \n\nOne study found that sowing seeds in large gaps within vegetation led to greater cover of sown target plant species than sowing in smaller gaps (Action 3409).
