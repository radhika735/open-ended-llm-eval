For temporary fishery closures, Action 2664 reported that one before-and-after, site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean found no increase in the biomass of the spawning stock of cod following a temporary fishery closure compared to fished areas over nine years, and no change in cod catches over nine years compared to fished areas. However, the same study found that during temporary closures, catch rates of red mullet and total catch (fish and invertebrates combined) increased after temporary closures compared to before, though European hake did not show this increase. For long-term fishery closures, Action 2655 reported that two site comparison studies found higher abundance of only one of seven fish species in areas closed to groundfish fisheries for six to eight years compared to open areas, but lower abundance of monkfish. One study found that lesser sandeel biomass and density peaked but there was no overall increase in the three years after a long-term fishery closure. Another study found more young salmon and similar numbers of older salmon returning to rivers in the five years after long-term closure of a commercial coastal fishery. Action 2680 reported that a global review found 10 of 11 studies showing effects of protection from restricting fishing activity in marine reserves found higher abundance of fish inside the areas compared to areas without fishing restrictions.",

One study found higher number of fish species in the no-fishing/no access zone of a multi-zoned marine protected area compared to partially fished zones and unprotected fished areas 10 to 15 years after implementation (Action 2674). However, one study found lower total fish species richness in marine protected areas closed to all fishing with limited exceptions for up to seven years compared to unprotected areas (Action 2681).\n\nFish Abundance and Biomass: Thirty of 54 site comparison studies found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish, fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species and most individual fish species/groups monitored compared to unprotected fished areas (Action 2682). Five of six reviews found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish and all fish and invertebrates combined compared to fished areas (Action 2682). However, eight studies found similar abundances of all fish and most individual fish species/groups between one and 20 years after implementation compared to fished areas (Action 2682).\n\nFish Size and Condition: Two global review studies and two systematic reviews found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall compared to fished areas (Action 2682). Eight of 11 site comparison studies found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall and larger individuals of most fish species/groups monitored compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years (Action 2682).\n\nEffects on Fish Community Composition: Seven site comparison studies found that protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for between three and 16 years had different fish community composition compared to fished areas (Action 2682).

Six studies\\u00a0found similar fish species/richness between one and 20 years after all fishing was banned in protected areas, compared to fished areas. One systematic review in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found no difference in species richness between unfished protected areas and fished areas. One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the effects of prohibiting all fishing on fish species richness/diversity after 15 years varied with the sampling method used.\\n\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (66 STUDIES)\\n\\nAbundance (64 studies): Thirty of 54 site comparison studies (18 replicated, eight replicated and paired, two before-and-after, one paired and before-and-after, and one replicated and before-and-after) in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, Coral Sea, Philippine Sea, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the Sulu Sea, found that marine protected areas that had been prohibiting all fishing for up to 25 years or more, had higher abundances (density and/or biomass) of all fish (total fish biomass, total fish density), fishery targeted fish species, non-fishery targeted fish species\\u00a0and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, except fish densities (all or most)\\u00a0and non-fishery targeted species, compared to unprotected fished areas and/or partly-fished protected areas. The studies also found that in some cases where the total fish biomass or densities were higher in no-fished areas, the effect varied between individual groups of fish based on species family\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain, commercial target and non-target species, fish sizes, depth\\u00a0and habitat types. Eight studies found that inside protected areas prohibiting all fishing there were similar abundances of all fish, and all or most of the individual fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas between one and 20 years after implementation. The other sixteen studies\\u00a0found that the effect of prohibiting fishing in protected areas for three to 20 years on fish abundance varied between fish species or groups and on their fished status (fishery target or non-target)\\u00a0and/or position in the food chain. One also found that the effect varied with size or age of the protected areas. Five of six reviews (three systematic) across the world, in the Pacific and/or Atlantic Oceans\\u00a0and in unreported regions\\u00a0found that non-fished marine reserves with one to 27 years of protection had higher abundances of all fish, all fish and invertebrates combined\\u00a0and blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between species/groups and fishing intensity outside reserves. The other review\\u00a0found that fish abundance varied between species in no-take marine reserves between one and 25 years old, and was affected by food chain position, level of exploitation and duration of protection. One replicated study in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found a long-term decline in the abundance/presence of eight of 12 shark and ray species inside an established (&gt;15 years) no-fishing protected area, however enforcement was poor. One before-and after, site comparison study in the Pacific Ocean, found no differences in overall fish abundance between a marine reserve closed permanently to fishing for five years and a closed area that was harvested for two years during the same period. One site comparison study in the Coral Sea\\u00a0found that in a no-take zone of an area protected for at least 10 years, fish abundance of four of six fish groups were similar to no-entry and fished zones, but two had lower abundance than the no-entry zone. One replicated, paired, site comparison study in the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that in a non-fished marine park zone abundance of commercially targeted fish was higher than partly fished zones but lower than unprotected areas after four to eight years.\\nReproductive success (1 study): One site comparison study in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0found more eggs of four commercially targeted fish species inside a non-fished marine reserve enforced for three years than in fished areas outside the reserve.\\nSurvival (1 study): One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in a marine protected area for three years resulted in similar survival of red hind grouper, compared to fished areas.\\nCondition (20 studies): Two global review studies\\u00a0(one systematic) and two systematic reviews in the Pacific Ocean\\u00a0and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\\u00a0found that prohibiting all fishing in marine protected areas for one to 27 years resulted in larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger blue cod\\u00a0compared to fished areas, but there were differences between individual fish families or species. Eight of 11 site comparison studies (four replicated, one before-and-after, one paired, and one replicated and paired) in the Tasman Sea, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Java Sea\\u00a0and the Philippine Sea, found that non-fished protected areas had larger fish overall\\u00a0and larger individuals of all or most of the fish species/groups monitored, compared to fished areas, after one to 22 years. The other three studies\\u00a0found similar fish sizes of all or all but one species, compared to fished areas one to 16 years after all fishing was prohibited. Three site comparison studies (one replicated) in the Coral Sea, Caribbean Sea\\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that fish size in protected areas that had not been fished for six to more than 20 years, varied between fish species or food chain groups. One site comparison study in the Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0found that red hind grouper were larger, but had similar growth, in an area protected from fishing for three years compared to fished areas.

One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that in non-fished areas protected for one and 24 years, fish grazing rates were higher compared to fished areas.\\n\\n\\u00a0OTHER (15 STUDIES)\\n\\nUse (7 studies): Four of six site comparison studies in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean\\u00a0and the Tasman Sea\\u00a0found that marine protected areas where all fishing had been prohibited for at least five to 15 years, were used for a large proportion of time by shark and ray species\\u00a0and commercially important reef fish species, compared to fished areas, thus were provided protection from fishing. Two other studies\\u00a0found that time spent inside areas closed to all fishing for 20 years\\u00a0and over 30 years, varied between species and with size for three shark species\\u00a0and with size for giant trevally. One replicated study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that most individuals of five fish species remained inside a marine reserve zone closed to fishing over a nine-year period.\\n\\n\\nCatch abundance (2 studies): One of two site comparison studies in the Mediterranean Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that commercial fish catch rates in small-scale traditional fisheries were highest closest to a marine reserve closed to all fishing for 22 years, and decreased with increasing distance from the reserve. The other study\\u00a0found that there was no increase in fish catch rates in commercially landed catch in the five years after a no-fishing zone was implemented in a co-managed protected area.\\nStock biomass (1 study): One replicated, site comparison study in the Indian Ocean\\u00a0found that the stock biomass (the harvested portion of the population) of reef fish species was highest in enforced protected areas closed to all fishing, compared to various other area management regimes.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFishing mortality (2 studies): Two site comparison studies in the North Sea\\u00a0and Pacific Ocean\\u00a0found that prohibiting fishing in protected areas resulted in reduced commercial fishing mortality of corkwing wrasse tagged inside non-fished marine reserves compared to fished areas, and that the overall fishing mortality of grey reef sharks tagged inside protected areas was low.\"\n}"

The effects varied between individual groups of fish based on species family, position in the food chain, commercial target status, fish sizes, depth and habitat types.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"2682\",\n    \"2674\",\n    \"2681\",\n    \"2224\",\n    \"2667\"\n  ]\n}"

Modifying longline configuration by increasing the lead weight on mid-water longlines to increase the sinking rate reduced catches of unwanted sharks and/or rays compared to standard longlines (Action 2699). Using nylon instead of wire hook attachments also reduced unwanted shark and/or ray catches, although one study found that survival of unwanted sharks caught on tuna longlines was reduced with nylon hook lines compared to wire (Action 2699). Attaching electropositive deterrent materials to longlines caught fewer unwanted sharks and rays compared to standard fishing gear or gears with non-deterrent materials, though results were mixed across studies with some finding similar catches compared to gear with no deterrents (Action 2696). Using different bait types showed mixed results, with two systematic global reviews finding that using different bait types did not affect the number of unwanted sharks and rays caught (Action 2700). Using artificial light on fishing gear was examined in only one study on shrimp trawl nets, which found fewer unwanted fish catches when lights were fitted to the fishing line compared to conventional trawl, though this was not specifically tested on longlines for sharks and rays (Action 2695).",
