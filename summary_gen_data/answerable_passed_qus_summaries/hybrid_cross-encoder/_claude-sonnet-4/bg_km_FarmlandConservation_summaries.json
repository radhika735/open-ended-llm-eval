Two reviews and two replicated controlled trials from the UK found that leaving uncut strips of rye grass on silage fields resulted in benefits to birds including increased numbers (Action 132).

However, birds that fed on different food resources such as insect-eaters showed more variable results with some preferring plots cut two or more times (Action 132).

A review from the UK found that raising mowing height may have increased productivity of Eurasian skylarks, but not sufficiently to maintain the local population (Action 222). A randomised, replicated and controlled study from the UK found that no more foraging birds were attracted to plots with raised mowing heights, compared to plots with shorter grass (Action 222). Similarly, a randomized, replicated, controlled trial from the UK found that raising mowing height on grasslands had no effect on numbers of foraging birds or invertebrates (Action 138). One replicated study from the UK found that northern lapwing and common starling chicks had greater foraging success in shorter grass (Action 138). For butterflies and moths, one replicated, randomized, controlled study in the UK found that intensively managed grassland plots cut to 10 cm had similar species richness and abundance of butterflies and caterpillars to plots cut to 5 cm (Action 3968).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on studies from multiple European countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Spain, and others, reducing tillage on European farmland shows several documented benefits and some potential drawbacks.\n\n**Documented Benefits:**\n\nSoil health improvements: Studies found higher soil organic carbon and organic matter content under reduced tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (Action 906, 1369, 1371). Reduced tillage increased soil water content and water infiltration rates in multiple European studies (Actions 1384, 1386). Soil erosion was reduced in seven out of nine studies, showing decreased soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage (Action 906).\n\nBiodiversity benefits: Studies across European countries found positive effects on earthworms including increased biomass and abundance (Actions 126, 1369). Some invertebrates showed greater abundance under reduced tillage systems (Action 126). Microbial biomass generally increased in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional systems (Actions 1369, 1371). Bird species including Eurasian skylark showed benefits such as higher nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (Actions 126, 211).\n\nNutrient retention: Studies found higher nitrogen and phosphorus retention in soils under reduced tillage systems (Actions 906, 1369, 1371). Water use efficiency improved for crops like barley under no-tillage systems compared to conventional tillage (Action 1384).\n\n**Potential Drawbacks:**\n\nCrop yield variations: Studies showed mixed results for crop yields, with some finding lower yields under reduced tillage, particularly for cereals in certain comparisons (Actions 1359, 1358). Some legume crops showed reduced yields under reduced tillage systems (Action 1359).\n\nSoil compaction: Three studies found higher compaction under reduced tillage systems compared to conventional methods (Action 906).\n\nInconsistent effects: Some studies found negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on earthworm abundance, some invertebrates, and certain bird species under reduced tillage (Action 126). Greenhouse gas emissions showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide emissions under reduced tillage (Actions 1369, 1371).\n\nPest and weed management: Studies indicated potential increases in some weed species under reduced tillage systems, though this also included beneficial effects on weed diversity (Action 126).\n\nTime-dependent effects: Long-term studies (after ten years) showed variable results, with some benefits decreasing over time, possibly due to extreme weather events (Actions 126, 211).",

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.

    "relevant_summary": "Multiple management techniques are available for restoring or creating species-rich wet meadows in European agricultural landscapes. Successful wet meadow restoration techniques include topsoil removal, introduction of target plant species, raising water levels, grazing, mowing, or combinations of removing topsoil and introducing target plant species plus livestock exclusion (Action 119). Traditional water meadow management involves techniques such as mowing once per year in autumn or light grazing with cattle or horses (Actions 3971, 696). Raising water levels in ditches or grassland increases plant species that favour wet conditions and can establish species typical of wet grassland more rapidly than vegetation management alone (Action 121). For species-rich grassland restoration, effective techniques include grazing, introducing plant species, hay spreading and mowing (Action 133). Mowing regime modifications are important, with cutting in June helping maintain relatively stable vegetation, though mowing has variable effects on plant species richness (Action 696). The timing of cutting affects plant communities, with summer-mown plots showing increased plant species richness compared to spring- or autumn-mown plots in fen meadows (Action 1771). Livestock type also influences results, with semi-natural grasslands grazed by cattle or horses showing greater butterfly species richness than those grazed by sheep (Action 3963). Reducing management intensity on permanent grasslands through multiple interventions can benefit plants, invertebrates and birds, though results vary (Action 69). Studies show positive restoration effects can occur within five years, though some restoration takes more than 10 years and may not be complete even after 20 years (Actions 119, 133).",

Seven individual studies examining the effects of reverting arable land to grassland found no clear benefit to wildlife, monitoring UK birds in winter and summer, wading birds in Denmark, grey partridges, brown hares in the UK, and plants in the Czech Republic (Action 561). One controlled before-and-after study from the UK showed that grey partridge numbers fell significantly following the reversion of arable fields to grassland (Actions 561, 210).\n\nSet-aside areas show more positive effects for wildlife. Of 34 studies comparing set-aside areas with control farmed fields, 20 studies from Austria, Finland, Germany and the UK showed benefits to or higher use by all wildlife groups considered. Twelve studies found some species or groups used set-aside more than crops, others did not. Only two studies found no effect, and one found an adverse effect of set-aside (Action 156). A systematic review from the UK found significantly higher densities of farmland birds on fields removed from production and under set-aside designation than on conventionally farmed fields in both winter and summer (Action 156). Three studies looking at skylarks found mixed results for reproductive success, with two UK studies finding higher nest survival or productivity on set-aside than control fields, while one UK study found lower nest survival on set-aside (Action 156).\n\nFor butterflies and moths, restoring arable land to permanent grassland shows positive effects. Three replicated studies found that 4-5-year-old created grasslands and abandoned cropland had greater species richness of butterflies, burnet moths and all moths than conventionally managed grassland or cultivated farms. Two studies found that restored grassland had higher abundance of moths than conventional grassland or unrestored crop fields (Action 3929).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to direct predator control can improve breeding success of ground-nesting birds on farmland. Physical protection methods include protecting individual nests with exclosures or barriers, which studies found increased fledging success and reduced predation rates (action 108, 400). Protecting nests from livestock trampling using cages prevented nest destruction in studies (action 237).\n\nHabitat management approaches include leaving cultivated, uncropped margins or plots (lapwing plots), which increased northern lapwing hatching success, Eurasian skylark nesting success, and provided breeding habitat for lapwing, skylark, grey partridge and yellow wagtail (action 562). Providing or retaining set-aside areas showed benefits, with studies finding higher nest survival or productivity for skylarks on set-aside compared to control fields (action 156). Planting wild bird seed or cover mixture increased bird diversity, densities, nesting densities and provided higher productivities for some species compared to other habitats (action 187).\n\nTiming modifications of farming operations offer additional alternatives. Delaying mowing or first grazing dates resulted in increased breeding wading bird densities and increased Eurasian skylark productivity (action 131). Delaying haying/mowing specifically reduced nest destruction by machinery and increased late-season nesting (action 223). Using wildlife-friendly mowing techniques reduced mortality levels for corncrakes and Eurasian skylarks compared to other techniques (action 192). Marking bird nests during harvest or mowing made marked northern lapwing nests less likely to fail from farming operations (action 148).\n\nSupplementary feeding increased farmland bird abundance, breeding population size, density, hatching, nestling growth and fledging rates in multiple studies (action 648). Providing refuges during harvest or mowing reduced contact between machinery and unfledged quail and corncrakes (action 147).",
