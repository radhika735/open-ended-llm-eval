    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration are effective, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is a widely studied approach, with six of seven studies finding that they significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). The effectiveness of culverts depends on design factors including diameter (wider culverts used more), substrate (natural substrates used more), and lighting effects (Action 884). Installing barrier fencing along roads is effective when combined with culverts, with seven of eight studies finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (Action 756). Barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers (Action 756). Human-assisted migration across roads is practiced extensively, with studies finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually (Action 784). However, despite human assistance, 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years and over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 784). Warning signage for motorists has limited effectiveness, with one study finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841). Installing overpasses over roads/railways has been studied primarily for reptiles, with limited specific information on amphibians (Action 3510).",

However, all partial harvesting methods still had negative impacts compared to no harvesting. Two studies found that harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting (Action 844). Two of three studies found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting, though one found no effect (Action 851).

Citizen science programs engaging volunteers to collect amphibian data involved 100-10,506 volunteers and were active in 16-17 states in the USA, with volunteers undertaking 412 surveys, surveying 121-7,872 sites, swabbing almost 6,000 amphibians and submitting thousands of amphibian records (Action 760). Volunteer engagement in habitat management showed population-level benefits, with studies in Estonia and Taiwan finding that habitat management with volunteer participation increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations, while programs engaged between eight and 41,000 volunteers in aquatic and terrestrial habitat restoration, restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km\u00b2 of habitat (Action 777). Public awareness campaigns demonstrated reach and impact, with studies in Estonia and the UK finding that raising public awareness, along with other interventions, increased numbers of natterjack toads and created 1,023 ponds for amphibians, while campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public each year or trained 1,016 people at 57 events over four years (Action 831). Education programmes showed effectiveness in knowledge transfer and conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Taiwan, Zimbabwe and the USA finding that education programmes increased amphibian knowledge of participants, and in Taiwan, education programmes about wetlands and amphibians, along with other interventions, doubled a population of Taipei frogs (Action 776). Volunteer road assistance programs demonstrated substantial engagement despite mixed conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, the UK and Italy finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved annually, with the UK having over 400 patrols and 71 patrols spending an average of 90 person-hours moving toads (Action 784).",

Head-starting programs, where amphibians are raised from eggs and then released, demonstrated that six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881). For natterjack toads specifically, translocations established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases (Action 859). Reviews indicated that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful, but success was not related to whether animals came from wild or captive sources, life-stage, continent, or reason for translocation (Action 854).",

Three reviews (including one systematic review) in the Netherlands and UK found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development (Action 779). However, Two reviews in the UK found that the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued over 10 years increased to over 600 in England and Wales (Action 779). In terms of trade regulation, one review found that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in the recovery of the over-exploited populations (Action 785), and similarly, one review found that reducing trade in two frog species through legislation allowed populations to recover from over-exploitation (Action 824). Regarding habitat protection, one replicated, site comparison study in the UK found that populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with a statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas, while one before-and-after study in the UK found that a common frog population increased but common toads decreased following the protection of a pond during development (Action 820). Financial incentive schemes showed more positive results: three studies (including one replicated study) in Denmark, Sweden and Taiwan found that payments to farmers created amphibian breeding habitat or increased frog or toad populations, although a second study in Taiwan found that payments did not maintain green tree frog habitat (Action 818). Additionally, one replicated, site comparison study in the Netherlands found that ditches managed under agri-environment schemes had higher numbers of amphibian species and higher abundance than those managed conventionally (Action 818).",

    "relevant_summary": "Studies have documented both benefits and negative impacts of livestock grazing on amphibian habitats and populations. Regarding benefits, habitat management that included reintroduction of grazing was found to increase green toad populations and maintain or increase natterjack toad populations and common toad populations (Action 780). Some amphibian species showed higher abundance in grazed areas, with bog turtles being less abundant in ungrazed sites compared to grazed sites, and juvenile box turtles being present less frequently in ungrazed sites (Action 3512). Green frogs and American toads were found to have higher abundance with grazing (Action 746). Grazing can be beneficial for breeding habitat, as bog turtle nests were laid only in areas that had been grazed in the current or previous growing season, and after grazing cattle to restore bog turtle habitat, more bog turtle eggs were laid and hatching success was higher (Action 3711). However, negative impacts have also been documented. Grazed plots did not have higher abundance of natterjack toads than ungrazed plots and had lower abundance of common toads (Action 780). Excluding livestock from streams or ponds did not increase numbers of amphibian species or overall abundance, but did increase larval abundance and abundance of green frog metamorphs (Action 746). Trampling damage was identified as a concern, with high-density spring-summer grazing resulting in fewer incidences of trampling compared to moderate-density autumn-winter grazing or low-density year-round grazing (Action 3496). Additionally, excluding cattle from ponds did not increase numbers of eggs or larval survival of Columbia spotted frogs (Action 746). The timing and intensity of grazing appears critical, as moderate density autumn-winter grazing and autumn-spring marsh flooding resulted in higher abundance of European pond turtles than high density spring-summer grazing (Action 3496).",

However, two studies found that created wetlands had fewer amphibian species or lower abundance and different communities compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). One global review and two site comparison studies in the USA combined created and restored wetlands and found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was higher or similar, or higher in 54% of studies and similar in 35% of studies reviewed compared to natural wetlands (Action 880). Five studies in Kenya and the USA found that four to 15 amphibian species used or colonized created wetlands (Action 880).\n\nFor wetland restoration, ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA compared amphibian numbers in restored and natural wetlands, with eight finding that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar (Action 879). Two found that the number of species or abundance was lower and species composition different in restored wetlands (Action 879).

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on effectiveness of removing invasive predators to benefit native amphibians varies significantly by predator type and is limited overall. For invasive amphibian predators, removal of American bullfrogs showed positive results in three studies: one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased a population of California red-legged frogs, another before-and-after study in the USA and Mexico found that eradicating bullfrogs increased the range of leopard frogs, and one replicated, before-and-after study in the USA found that California red-legged frogs were found out in the open twice as frequently once bullfrogs had been removed (Action 825). One before-and-after study in the USA found that removal of invasive Cuban tree frogs increased the abundance of squirrel tree frogs and green tree frogs (Action 822). For fish predator removal, four studies including two replicated, controlled studies in the USA found that removing fish by catching them significantly increased abundance of salamanders or frogs or increased recruitment, survival and population growth rate of cascades frog, though one before-and-after study in the UK found that fish control had no significant effect on great crested newt populations and fish remained or returned within a few years, and one replicated, before-and-after study in Sweden found that fish control did not increase green toad breeding success and fish were soon reintroduced (Action 827). One before-and-after study in the USA found that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species, and one replicated, before-and-after study in Estonia found that pond restoration, which sometimes included drying to eliminate fish, increased numbers of species and breeding populations of common spadefoot toads and great crested newts compared to no management (Action 826). For mammalian predator control, one controlled study in New Zealand found that controlling rats had no significant effect on numbers of Hochstetter's frog, though one controlled study in New Zealand found that survival of Maud Island frogs was significantly higher in a predator-proof enclosure than in the wild (Action 839). For reptilian predators, one before-and-after study in Mallorca found that numbers of Mallorcan midwife toad larvae increased after intensive, but not less intensive, removal of viperine snakes (Action 830). However, there is no evidence available for several invasive predator types: no studies were found that evaluated the effects of removing toxic invasive amphibians like cane toads and Asian toads on reptile populations (Action 3699), no studies on effects of removing cane toads on amphibian populations (Action 798), and no evidence for effects of removing non-native crayfish on amphibian populations (Action 797).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence from captive breeding studies, hormone treatments and artificial fertilization show distinct patterns of success and challenges in frog breeding programs involving Australian research. \n\nFor hormone treatments, studies involving Australian programs found mixed results for female amphibians, with 30-71% of females producing viable eggs following treatment, with success depending on the combination, amount or number of hormone doses (Action 883). In males, hormone treatment stimulated or increased sperm production and resulted in successful breeding in captivity, though the amount and viability of sperm produced was affected by the type, amount or number of doses of hormone (Action 883). Importantly, eggs induced by hormone treatment were successfully raised to tadpoles, toadlets or froglets in captivity in several studies (Action 883).\n\nFor artificial fertilization, Australian studies found that success depended on the type and number of doses of hormones used to stimulate egg production (Action 834). One specific Australian study found that 55% of eggs were fertilized artificially, but soon died, indicating a challenge with post-fertilization survival (Action 834). The success of artificial fertilization was directly linked to the effectiveness of prior hormone treatments to stimulate egg production (Action 834).\n\nOverall, studies found that amphibians produced eggs in captivity, with some species or 17-50% of captive populations reproducing successfully, though other species were difficult to maintain or raise to adults (Action 835). Captive-bred frogs were raised successfully to hatching, tadpoles, froglets or adults in captivity in multiple studies, though survival rates varied (Action 835). Australian captive breeding programs have been used for species like green and golden bell frogs, though breeding population establishment from captive-bred releases has shown limited success (Action 872).",

    "relevant_summary": "Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration show strong effectiveness, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). \n\nPhysical interventions show variable effectiveness. For barrier fencing, seven of eight studies in Germany, Canada and the USA found that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, or decreased deaths provided that the fence length and material were effective, though one found that low numbers of amphibians were diverted by barriers during breeding migrations (Action 756). However, barriers have limitations - treefrogs and 10% of common toads climbed over barrier fencing during breeding migrations, and barriers at least 0.6 m high were required to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs climbing over (Action 756).\n\nFor tunnels and culverts, thirty-two studies investigated their effectiveness, with six of seven studies finding that installing culverts or tunnels significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). However, usage varies significantly - fifteen of 24 studies found that culverts/tunnels were used by 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species, while five found that culverts were used by less than 10% of amphibians or were not used (Action 884). Effectiveness was affected by culvert diameter (wider culverts used more), length (long culverts avoided), lighting (mixed effects), substrate (natural substrates used more), presence of water (mixed effects), entrance location and tunnel climate (Action 884). One study noted that thousands of amphibians were still killed on the road despite culvert installation (Action 884).",

Thinning trees within forests showed mixed results on amphibian abundance, with some studies finding increased abundance except for ensatina salamanders, while others found negative overall responses or no effect depending on species and time since harvest (Action 852). Thinning resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations compared to clearcutting, and amphibians showed a less negative overall response in thinned forest compared to clearcut forest (Action 852). Harvesting groups of trees instead of clearcutting did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting, but a meta-analysis found that this partial harvest method resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 844). Shelterwood harvesting compared to clearcutting resulted in higher, similar, or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance, with partial harvest methods including shelterwood resulting in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 851). However, compared to no harvesting, shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition in most studies (Action 851). For patch retention instead of clearcutting, no evidence was found for effects on amphibian populations, though one study found that released red-legged frogs showed movement patterns toward larger retained tree patches (Action 847).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on documented evidence, releasing captive-bred or head-started toads into the wild shows several benefits. Studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with success rates varying by species and location - Mallorcan midwife toads established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites, while natterjack toads established populations at 70% of sites (action 875, 873). Head-starting programs showed positive outcomes, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding frog populations or increased populations of frogs or toads (action 881). One global review found that 41% of release programmes of captive-bred or head-started amphibians showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, while 29% showed some evidence of breeding and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (action 871). Head-started amphibians demonstrated advantages including greater survival to metamorphosis, larger size at metamorphosis, and shorter time to metamorphosis compared to wild animals (action 881).\n\nHowever, potential negative impacts are also documented. Survival of released captive-bred Puerto Rican crested toads was low with 25% predated within two days of release (action 875). Some programs failed to establish breeding populations, and in one case populations were not established from captive-bred and head-started toads (action 875). Genetic consequences of captive breeding include reduced genetic diversity in captive-bred reintroduced populations (action 873, 837). A study of Mallorcan midwife toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations found slower tadpole development, reduction in one predator defence trait, and decreased genetic diversity (action 837). Adult survival rates could be as low as 1-17% over four years, and breeding success following adult releases was limited in some cases (action 881).",

Creating refuges involves adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, with two replicated, controlled studies in the USA and Indonesia finding mixed effects on abundance of individual species, and one before-and-after study in Australia finding that restoration including reintroducing coarse woody debris increased frog species (Action 772). Creating artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites can maintain amphibian populations, with one replicated, before-and-after study in the UK finding that providing artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management maintained populations of great crested newts, and other studies finding these structures were used by various amphibian species including common frog and smooth newts (Action 759). Leaving coarse woody debris in forests shows benefits, with one replicated, controlled study in the USA finding that migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed, and another study finding that survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas (Action 843). Wetland restoration can provide important habitat, with ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA finding that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar between restored and natural wetlands, and seven of nine studies finding that wetland restoration increased numbers of amphibian species with breeding populations establishing in some cases (Action 879). Replanting vegetation supports amphibian habitat, with three studies in Australia, Canada and Spain finding that amphibian abundance became similar to natural sites following tree planting, and one before-and-after study in Australia finding that numbers of frog species increased following restoration that included planting shrubs and trees (Action 849). Restoring habitat connectivity can reduce mortality, with one before-and-after study in Italy finding that restoring connectivity between two wetlands by raising a road on a viaduct significantly decreased deaths of migrating amphibians (Action 840).",

However, when compared to no harvesting, two of three studies found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (action 851).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 32 studies investigating road tunnels and culverts for amphibians, several design and placement factors are associated with successful use by migrating amphibians (Action 884). Barrier fencing to guide amphibians to tunnel entrances is a critical placement factor, with the majority of successful culverts/tunnels having barrier fencing installed (Action 884). Seven of eight studies found that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, with effectiveness dependent on fence length and material (Action 756). Barriers must be at least 0.6 m high to prevent climbing over by green frogs and leopard frogs (Action 756). \n\nTunnel diameter affects usage, with wider culverts used more by amphibians in three of six studies (Action 884). Tunnel length is also important, with long culverts being avoided in one of two studies (Action 884). Substrate type influences usage, with natural substrates used more than artificial ones in three of six studies (Action 884). The presence of water has mixed effects on usage across two of three studies (Action 884). Lighting affects tunnel usage with mixed effects found in all three studies examining this factor (Action 884). Entrance location and tunnel climate each affected usage in one study (Action 884). \n\nCertain tunnel designs are not suitable for amphibians, including one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes which resulted in high mortality of common toads, and steel culverts with condensation deposits that had very high metal concentrations (Action 884). Studies found that culverts with flowing water were used by amphibians, though usage varied by species and compared to dry culverts (Action 884).",

Legislative regulation to protect wild populations showed some success, with one review finding that legislation to reduce trade in two frog species resulted in the recovery of over-exploited populations (Action 785). Similarly, reducing trade in two frog species through legislation allowed populations to recover from over-exploitation (Action 824). For habitat protection, populations of natterjack toads were better protected at sites with statutory level of habitat protection than those outside protected areas, and one study found that a common frog population increased following the protection of a pond during development (Action 820). Regarding mitigation measures, studies found that requiring mitigation of impacts to wetlands often did not prevent loss of wetland area, with the total area restored/created being less than the area destroyed in most cases, and most mitigation projects failing to meet targets stipulated in permits (Action 3386). General protection for marshes or swamps showed mixed results, with wetland areas continuing to decline despite protection, though the decline was slower than in periods without protection (Action 3385).",

Antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis in twelve of sixteen studies, with itraconazole being particularly effective in six of eight studies testing this specific antifungal (Action 882). Antibacterial treatment with chloramphenicol cured green tree frogs and Archey's frogs of chytridiomycosis in two studies, though trimethoprim-sulfadiazine only increased survival time without curing blue-and-yellow poison dart frogs (Action 763). \n\nThe least beneficial treatment strategies include antifungal skin bacteria or peptides. Three of four studies found that adding antifungal bacteria to the skin of salamanders or frogs did not reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or death, and treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides did not significantly increase survival of common toads (Action 764). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (Action 882).

For Mallorcan midwife toads specifically, captive-bred individuals released as tadpoles, toadlets or adults established breeding populations at 38%, 80% or 100% of sites respectively (Action 873). However, one study found that predator defences were maintained but genetic diversity was reduced in captive-bred reintroduced populations (Action 873). For toads more generally, two of three studies found that captive-bred toads released as tadpoles, juveniles or metamorphs established populations, with one study showing establishment at 70% of sites (Action 875). However, survival can be problematic - studies of Puerto Rican crested toads found low survival rates with 25% predated within two days of release (Action 875). Head-starting programs showed more promising results, with six of 10 studies finding that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881). Natterjack toad translocations established breeding populations at 30-70% of sites (Action 859), while general toad translocations showed that two of four studies successfully established breeding populations (Action 855). Long-term captive breeding can have negative effects, with toads bred in captivity for nine or more generations showing slower tadpole development, reduction in predator defence traits and decreased genetic diversity (Action 837).",
