    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration are effective, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is a widely studied approach, with six of seven studies finding that they significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). The effectiveness of culverts depends on design factors including diameter (wider culverts used more), substrate (natural substrates used more), and lighting effects (Action 884). Installing barrier fencing along roads is effective when combined with culverts, with seven of eight studies finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (Action 756). Barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers (Action 756). Human-assisted migration across roads is practiced extensively, with studies finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually (Action 784). However, despite human assistance, 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years and over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 784). Warning signage for motorists has limited effectiveness, with one study finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841). Installing overpasses over roads/railways has been studied primarily for reptiles, with limited specific information on amphibians (Action 3510).",

However, all partial harvesting methods still had negative impacts compared to no harvesting. Two studies found that harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting (Action 844). Two of three studies found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting, though one found no effect (Action 851).

Citizen science programs engaging volunteers to collect amphibian data involved 100-10,506 volunteers and were active in 16-17 states in the USA, with volunteers undertaking 412 surveys, surveying 121-7,872 sites, swabbing almost 6,000 amphibians and submitting thousands of amphibian records (Action 760). Volunteer engagement in habitat management showed population-level benefits, with studies in Estonia and Taiwan finding that habitat management with volunteer participation increased natterjack toad and Taipei frog populations, while programs engaged between eight and 41,000 volunteers in aquatic and terrestrial habitat restoration, restoring up to 1,023 ponds or over 11,500 km\u00b2 of habitat (Action 777). Public awareness campaigns demonstrated reach and impact, with studies in Estonia and the UK finding that raising public awareness, along with other interventions, increased numbers of natterjack toads and created 1,023 ponds for amphibians, while campaigns reached over 50,000 members of the public each year or trained 1,016 people at 57 events over four years (Action 831). Education programmes showed effectiveness in knowledge transfer and conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, Mexico, Slovenia, Taiwan, Zimbabwe and the USA finding that education programmes increased amphibian knowledge of participants, and in Taiwan, education programmes about wetlands and amphibians, along with other interventions, doubled a population of Taipei frogs (Action 776). Volunteer road assistance programs demonstrated substantial engagement despite mixed conservation outcomes, with studies in Germany, the UK and Italy finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved annually, with the UK having over 400 patrols and 71 patrols spending an average of 90 person-hours moving toads (Action 784).",

Head-starting programs, where amphibians are raised from eggs and then released, demonstrated that six of 10 studies found that released head-started tadpoles, metamorphs or juveniles established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881). For natterjack toads specifically, translocations established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases (Action 859). Reviews indicated that translocations of over 1,000 animals were more successful, but success was not related to whether animals came from wild or captive sources, life-stage, continent, or reason for translocation (Action 854).",
