    "relevant_summary": "Several actions can be taken to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations. Road closures during seasonal amphibian migration are effective, with two studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites and at road closure sites with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842). Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is a widely studied approach, with six of seven studies finding that they significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, though in one study this was only effective when barrier fencing was also installed (Action 884). The effectiveness of culverts depends on design factors including diameter (wider culverts used more), substrate (natural substrates used more), and lighting effects (Action 884). Installing barrier fencing along roads is effective when combined with culverts, with seven of eight studies finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths (Action 756). Barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though some species like treefrogs and 10% of common toads can still climb over barriers (Action 756). Human-assisted migration across roads is practiced extensively, with studies finding that large numbers of amphibians were moved across roads by patrols, ranging from 7,532 toads to half a million moved during breeding migrations annually (Action 784). However, despite human assistance, 64-70% of populations still declined over 6-10 years and over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 784). Warning signage for motorists has limited effectiveness, with one study finding that despite warning signs and human assistance, over 500 toads were still killed on some roads (Action 841). Installing overpasses over roads/railways has been studied primarily for reptiles, with limited specific information on amphibians (Action 3510).",

However, all partial harvesting methods still had negative impacts compared to no harvesting. Two studies found that harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting (Action 844). Two of three studies found that shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition compared to no harvesting, though one found no effect (Action 851).
