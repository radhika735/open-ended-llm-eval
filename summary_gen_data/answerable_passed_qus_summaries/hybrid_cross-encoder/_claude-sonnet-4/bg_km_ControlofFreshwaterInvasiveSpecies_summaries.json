    "relevant_summary": "Chemical herbicide methods show variable effectiveness for controlling Crassula helmsii. Glyphosate reduced C. helmsii in seven studies, with one study showing a 98% reduction when glyphosate was combined with diquat (Action 1279). When glyphosate was applied after covering plants with carpet, it resulted in an 80% reduction (Action 1279, 1313). Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii, though one small trial found no effect (Action 1279). Other herbicides showed partial effectiveness: dichlobenil led to partial biomass reduction in one out of two studies, while terbutryne partially reduced biomass of submerged plants (Action 1279). Hydrogen peroxide did not control C. helmsii in controlled tank trials (Action 1281).\n\nPhysical methods using lightproof barriers demonstrated strong effectiveness. Five before-and-after studies found that covering C. helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where eradication was initially reported (Action 1294). Aquatic dyes to reduce light levels did not reduce C. helmsii coverage (Action 1293).\n\nSalt water treatment showed consistent effectiveness, with two replicated controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii (Action 1288).",

Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets was found to be effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046). One study found that removal of juveniles by trapping resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface (action 1045), however catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using double fyke nets for 24 hours was found to be very low (action 1045). One study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045), though shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction resulted in a significant reduction in adults and juveniles when part of a combination treatment (action 1045). General bullfrog removal and control has been shown to benefit native amphibian populations, with studies finding that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased California red-legged frog populations and increased the range of leopard frogs (action 825). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of pond destruction, draining ponds/altering water timing, or habitat modification as control methods for American bullfrogs (actions 1042, 1043, 1041).",

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in Canada found 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours of exposure to water of 30% salinity (Action 1072). A controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that an electrical barrier prevented movement of round gobies across it, and that increasing electrical pulse duration and voltage increased effectiveness of the barrier (Action 1074).
