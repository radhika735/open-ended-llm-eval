    "relevant_summary": "Chemical herbicide methods show variable effectiveness for controlling Crassula helmsii. Glyphosate reduced C. helmsii in seven studies, with one study showing a 98% reduction when glyphosate was combined with diquat (Action 1279). When glyphosate was applied after covering plants with carpet, it resulted in an 80% reduction (Action 1279, 1313). Three out of four studies found that diquat or diquat alginate reduced cover or eradicated submerged C. helmsii, though one small trial found no effect (Action 1279). Other herbicides showed partial effectiveness: dichlobenil led to partial biomass reduction in one out of two studies, while terbutryne partially reduced biomass of submerged plants (Action 1279). Hydrogen peroxide did not control C. helmsii in controlled tank trials (Action 1281).\n\nPhysical methods using lightproof barriers demonstrated strong effectiveness. Five before-and-after studies found that covering C. helmsii with black sheeting or carpet strips eradicated or severely reduced plant cover, though progressive recolonization occurred at two sites where eradication was initially reported (Action 1294). Aquatic dyes to reduce light levels did not reduce C. helmsii coverage (Action 1293).\n\nSalt water treatment showed consistent effectiveness, with two replicated controlled container trials and two before-and-after field trials finding that seawater eradicated C. helmsii (Action 1288).",

Direct removal of juveniles using double fyke nets was found to be effective in catching bullfrog tadpoles in small shallow ponds (action 1046). One study found that removal of juveniles by trapping resulted in a significant reduction in the number of recorded adults and juveniles when carried out as part of a combination treatment (action 1046). For adult removal, one study found that adult bullfrogs can be captured overnight using a single trap floating on the water surface (action 1045), however catchability of adult bullfrogs in small shallow ponds using double fyke nets for 24 hours was found to be very low (action 1045). One study found that bullfrog populations rapidly rebounded following intensive removal of adults (action 1045), though shooting of metamorphosed individuals before reproduction resulted in a significant reduction in adults and juveniles when part of a combination treatment (action 1045). General bullfrog removal and control has been shown to benefit native amphibian populations, with studies finding that removing American bullfrogs significantly increased California red-legged frog populations and increased the range of leopard frogs (action 825). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of pond destruction, draining ponds/altering water timing, or habitat modification as control methods for American bullfrogs (actions 1042, 1043, 1041).",

A replicated, controlled laboratory study in Canada found 100% mortality of round gobies within 48 hours of exposure to water of 30% salinity (Action 1072). A controlled, replicated field study in the USA found that an electrical barrier prevented movement of round gobies across it, and that increasing electrical pulse duration and voltage increased effectiveness of the barrier (Action 1074).

Creating barriers using concrete dams across streams with features designed to prevent red swamp crayfish from crawling over them was found to be effective at containing spread of the population upstream in a study conducted in Spain between 2007 and 2010 (Action 1037). Trapping and removal methods show promise, with a study in Italy finding that baiting traps with food (tinned meat) trapped the most red swamp crayfish compared to using male and female pheromones or no bait, with over half of all crayfish caught found in food-baited traps (Action 1029). Chemical control methods have been tested, with one study in Italy finding that red swamp crayfish could be killed using the natural pyrethrum Pyblast at a concentration of 0.05 mg/l, though application to drained crayfish burrows was not effective (Action 1036). Biological control through encouraging predators is another option, with studies showing that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and pike were found to predate red swamp crayfish in studies from Italy and France (Action 1030). Male sterilization using X-rays was found to reduce the number of offspring produced by 43% in a laboratory study in Italy (Action 1032). Several other potential control methods including draining waterways, electrofishing, removing food sources, and relocating vulnerable native crayfish species currently have no evidence for their effectiveness against Procambarus crayfish populations (Actions 1034, 1035, 1033, 1038, 797).",

Equipment cleaning strategies are also valuable, as mechanical removal and regular cleaning of industrial pipes or addition of sand filters were effective methods of permanently removing or reducing numbers of Asian clams, respectively (Action 1119). Gas-impermeable barriers placed across the bottom of water bodies significantly reduced the abundance of Asian clams (Action 1117).

Population size is a critical factor - for water primrose, hand-pulling from pond margins successfully eradicated smaller populations, while hand pulling and raking failed to reduce abundance in larger populations (action 1138). Plant maturity affects removal effectiveness, with manual removal of mature skunk cabbage plants being effective for small outbreaks of small-growing plants (action 1101). The timing and frequency of removal operations significantly impacts success - annual physical removal of recently established skunk cabbage plants over five years removed the entire stock, while twice yearly full removal programmes for mature skunk cabbage populations required continued removal of large numbers of plants even after four years (action 1101). The regeneration rate relative to removal rate is crucial, as demonstrated with floating pennywort where the growth rate exceeded the removal rate following a two-week physical removal program (action 1126). Method and thoroughness of removal matter, with mechanical digger removal combined with monthly hand picking greatly reducing floating pennywort cover but not achieving complete eradication (action 1126). Combination approaches can improve effectiveness, with herbicide application followed by mechanical removal achieving a 75% kill rate for water primrose, and combinations of herbicide, physical removal, native plant promotion and mulching reducing Peruvian primrose-willow coverage by 85-90% (action 1140).",

Some chemical treatments showed effectiveness: iodine solution, acetic acid, Virkon S and sodium hypochlorite added to freshwater killed invasive killer shrimp, but were considered impractical for field application (Action ID: 1095). Exposure to parasites showed promise, as an introduced parasitic mould reduced populations of an invasive shrimp (Action ID: 1089). Changing salinity showed mixed results: one study found increasing salinity killed the majority of invasive shrimp within five hours, while another found it did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1091). Carbonating water stunned invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1088). The least effective actions include changing water pH, which did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1093), and several chemicals - methanol, citric acid, urea, hydrogen peroxide and sucrose did not kill invasive killer shrimp (Action ID: 1095). Several actions had no evidence captured for their effectiveness including biological control using predatory fish (Action ID: 1087), exchanging ballast water (Action ID: 1097), exposure to disease-causing organisms (Action ID: 1090), and cleaning equipment (Action ID: 1096).",

For Procambarus crayfish control, two replicated, controlled studies in Italy found that eels fed on red swamp crayfish and reduced population size, and one replicated, controlled study from France found that pike predated red swamp crayfish (Action 1030). Combined approaches appear more effective, as a before-and-after study in Switzerland found that introducing predators combined with trapping significantly reduced red swamp crayfish populations in a pond, and a replicated, controlled study from Italy demonstrated that trapping and predation in combination was more effective at reducing red swamp crayfish populations than predation alone (Action 1031).
