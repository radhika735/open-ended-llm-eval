    "relevant_summary": "The documented benefits of reduced tillage systems on European farms include multiple positive effects on biodiversity, soil health, and some crop outcomes. From studies across Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the UK, reduced tillage showed positive effects on earthworm biomass, species richness or abundance (action 126). Some invertebrates other than earthworms showed greater abundance, and certain farmland birds including Eurasian skylark showed higher nest density, earlier laying dates, and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields (action 126). Soil benefits include higher soil organic carbon in no-tillage or reduced tillage systems compared to conventionally tilled soil across studies from multiple countries (action 906), maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure (action 906), and higher nutrient retention (action 906). Additional soil benefits documented across Mediterranean countries include more organic matter in soils with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1371), more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils with reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1371), and more microbial biomass in some comparisons (action 1371). Reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing was shown in seven trials (action 906). For crop production, studies from Egypt, France, Spain, and Turkey found higher cereal yields in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage in some comparisons (action 1359), and studies from Italy and the USA found higher fruit or vegetable yields in plots with reduced tillage in some comparisons (action 1359).\n\nThe documented harms and limitations include negative effects on some aspects of biodiversity and mixed crop outcomes. Studies found reducing tillage had negative, no effect, or inconsistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates other than earthworms, earthworm abundance in some cases, and some bird species (action 126). Soil-related negative effects include higher compaction under reduced tillage found in three replicated trials (action 906), and no-tillage increasing soil loss in the absence of crop cover in two trials (action 906). For crops, studies from Lebanon and Spain found lower cereal yields in plots with reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 1359), and lower legume yields in some comparisons (action 1359). One study found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage (action 906). Mixed effects were also documented, with some studies finding both positive and negative results depending on specific conditions, crops, or time periods.",

Thirty-four studies (of which 21 were replicated and controlled and seven also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found some positive effects on earthworms, some invertebrates (other than earthworms), weeds or farmland birds, of reducing tillage compared to conventional management. Positive effects included increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms, greater abundance of some invertebrates other than earthworms, increased numbers of some weeds and/or weed species, higher Eurasian skylark nest density, earlier laying date and shorter foraging distances on reduced tillage fields, and greater abundance of some birds - including Eurasian skylark, seed-eating songbirds and gamebirds in late winter on non-inversion or conservation tillage. A review found tillage had negative effects on invertebrate numbers and no-till systems had more invertebrate bird food resources.\\nTwenty-six studies (of which 13 replicated and controlled and three also randomized, and five reviews) from nine European countries found reducing tillage had either negative, no effect or no consistent effects on abundance, biomass, or species richness of some invertebrates (other than earthworms), earthworm abundance, biomass, or species richness, number of different plant species found as seeds, number of some weed species, mammal abundance, some bird species, and one study found bird preferences for conservation tillage fields decreased over time. Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

Of these, four (including three replicated trials (three also randomized and one also controlled)) found more microbes, more species of earthworm, or higher microbe activity under reduced tillage. One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon. One randomized, replicated trial from Spain found greater soil organic carbon in conventionally tilled soil. One replicated trial from Canada found no effect of tillage on soil carbon.\\nSoil organic matter: Fifteen studies from Canada, China, Europe, Morocco, and the USA measured effects of reduced tillage on soil organic matter content and nutrient retention. Of these, eight studies (including four replicated (two also randomized), two site comparisons (one also replicated) and one controlled) found maintained or increased soil organic matter and improved soil structure under reduced tillage. Four trials (including two replicated and two site comparison studies) found higher nutrient retention under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found less carbon and nitrate in no-till compared to conventionally tilled soil, but conventionally tilled soil lost more carbon and nitrate. One controlled, randomized, replicated trial and one replicated trial found mixed effects of reduced tillage on soil nitrogen levels.\\nYield: One replicated study from Canada found lower yields under minimum or no-tillage compared to conventional tillage, and one controlled, randomized, replicated study from the USA found higher yields when subsoiling was done.
