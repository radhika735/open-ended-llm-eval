Action 1731 shows that tree removal alone increased cover of some herb species including cottongrasses and sedges in bogs and fens, reduced cover of forest-characteristic mosses in bogs, and increased total plant species richness in rich fens.

This combined approach increased abundance of wetland-characteristic plants, showed mixed to positive effects on Sphagnum moss cover with two studies finding increased Sphagnum cover, and increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges across multiple studies. The combined intervention changed overall plant community composition to become less like sites that remained drained and forested, reduced the number of tall trees for 1-3 years, and increased plant species richness in rich fens.\n\nAction 1756 indicates that rewetting alone typically reduces or has no effect on tree and shrub cover across multiple studies, increases Sphagnum moss cover in twelve studies, and increases cover of various herb groups including sedges, cottongrasses, and reeds.

Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

However, five studies found no effect: in bogs in the Czech Republic\\u00a0and Latvia, fens in Sweden\\u00a0and Germany, and forested fens in Finland.

    "relevant_summary": "Several management options are available to mitigate damage from human recreational access on peatlands, though evidence for their effectiveness is limited. Direct access control measures include restricting pedestrian access to peatlands (Action 1751), installing boardwalks/paths to prevent trampling (Action 1753), and limiting, ceasing or prohibiting access for recreational purposes (Action 2152). However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these direct access management approaches on peatland vegetation. Alternative management approaches include adopting ecotourism principles/creating an ecotourism site (Action 1755), though again no studies evaluated effects on peatland vegetation. Protection and enforcement measures such as increasing 'on-the-ground' protection through rangers (Action 1800) showed some evidence of effectiveness, with one before-and-after study in a peat swamp forest in Indonesia reporting that the number of illegal sawmills decreased over two years of anti-logging patrols. Education and awareness approaches include providing education or training programmes about peatlands or peatland management (Action 1848), which showed behavior change effects in two studies in tropical peat swamps, with over 3,500 households adopting sustainable farming practices following workshops. Raising general awareness amongst the public (Action 1844) also demonstrated behavior change, with one before-and-after study in the UK reporting that following awareness-raising activities, the percentage of the public buying peat-free compost increased. Engaging volunteers in peatland management or monitoring (Action 1847) is another option, though no studies evaluated its effects on peatland habitats or vegetation.",

Moss cover, including Sphagnum, was higher in plots burned more often in UK bog studies. Burning reduced purple moor grass cover and lowered heather cover in both German and UK bog studies.\n\nFor maintaining or restoring disturbance (Action 1763): Burning reduced tree/shrub cover in fens in the USA and UK. Two studies found that burning increased plant species richness or diversity in a fen in the USA and a bog in New Zealand. Burning reduced forb cover and increased sedge/rush cover in USA fen studies.\n\n**Negative impacts of prescribed fire in peatlands:**\n\nFrom control of problematic plants studies (Action 1774): Burning reduced or limited plant species richness in both USA fen and UK bog studies. Plots burned more frequently contained less total vegetation, shrub and bryophyte biomass despite containing more grass-like plant biomass.\n\nFrom disturbance management studies (Action 1763): One UK fen study reported that burning reduced grass/sedge/rush cover and had no effect on cover of fen-characteristic mosses or herbs. Another UK study found burning typically had no effect on plant species richness and diversity.\n\nThe evidence shows mixed results depending on ecosystem type (bogs vs fens), burning frequency, and management objectives, with effects varying between increased biodiversity in some contexts and reduced species richness in others.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on 36 studies evaluating the effects of rewetting on peatland vegetation (Action 1756), typical effects include significant changes in plant community composition where drier grassland communities are replaced by more wetland- or peatland-characteristic communities. Rewetting typically increases Sphagnum moss cover or abundance in bogs, fens and other peatlands, with 12 studies reporting this effect. Herb cover shows consistent increases, particularly for sedges (13 of 15 studies showed increased sedge cover), cottongrass (8 of 9 studies), and reed/rush cover (5 of 7 studies). Tree and shrub cover typically reduces or shows no effect following rewetting, with 10 studies reporting these outcomes. Wetland-characteristic plants generally increase in abundance following rewetting, while upland plant cover decreases. Effects on overall plant species richness and diversity are mixed, with 6 studies showing increases and 5 studies showing no effect. For combined interventions of cutting/removing trees and rewetting (Action 1732), studies show increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, increased Sphagnum cover in some cases, and changes in plant community composition to become less like drained forested sites. Multiple restoration interventions including rewetting (Action 1803) consistently increase total moss or bryophyte cover and herbaceous plant cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants.",

Three of these studies\\u00a0reported mixed responses by species. Two additional replicated studies, in bogs in Latvia\\u00a0and forested fens in Finland, reported that rewetting had no effect on Sphagnum\\u00a0cover. Five studies (one paired, controlled, before-and-after) in Finland, Sweden\\u00a0and Canada\\u00a0reported that rewetting bogs or fens had no effect on cover of non-Sphagnum mosses (or mosses/lichens). However, two controlled studies in bogs in Ireland\\u00a0and the UK\\u00a0reported that rewetting reduced cover of non-Sphagnum mosses\\u00a0or bryophytes. One site comparison study in Finland\\u00a0reported that a rewetted peatland had similar moss cover (Sphagnum and total) to a natural peatland, but another site comparison study in Canada\\u00a0reported that a rewetted bog had lower moss cover (Sphagnum and other) than nearby target peatlands.\\nHerb cover (25 studies): Twenty-one studies (including four replicated, paired, controlled) reported that rewetting (sometimes\\u00a0along with other interventions) increased cover of at least one group of herbs.

One replicated site comparison study in forested fens in Finland\\u00a0reported that rewetting had no effect on total herb cover.

Wetland-characteristic plants generally increase in abundance following rewetting, while upland plant cover decreases. Effects on overall plant species richness and diversity are mixed, with 6 studies showing increases and 5 studies showing no effect. For combined interventions of cutting/removing trees and rewetting (Action 1732), studies show increased cover of herbs including cottongrasses and sedges, increased Sphagnum cover in some cases, and changes in plant community composition to become less like drained forested sites. Multiple restoration interventions including rewetting (Action 1803) consistently increase total moss or bryophyte cover and herbaceous plant cover including cottongrass and other grass-like plants.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1756\",\n    \"1732\",\n    \"1803\"\n  ]\n}"
