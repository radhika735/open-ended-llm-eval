Raising water levels in ditches or grassland was associated with increased bird numbers and breeding bird numbers, increases in wet-favouring plant species, and higher invertebrate numbers or biomass; more rapid establishment of species typical of wet grassland than vegetation management; and agri-environment options controlling water levels were suggested as more effective for wading birds than easier options [121]. Creating scrapes, pools, or ditch\u2011fed ponds increased site use or breeding populations of birds, with newly created wet features used by lapwing chicks and higher chick condition where many footdrains were present [359]; scrapes and pools provided habitat for a range of plant, invertebrate, and bird species, increased aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity, and supported locally or nationally scarce plant and water beetle species [153]. Creating or restoring ponds led to reptile presence and pond occupancy by multiple reptile species in several regions [3730], and created ponds were widely used and colonized by amphibians, with species numbers sometimes similar or higher than in natural ponds and stable populations established in many cases; pond age, permanence, vegetation, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, and fish presence affected use or success [869]. Artificial water sources (e.g., farm/cattle ponds, retention ponds, drainage ditches) were associated with similar or higher bat activity relative to natural or surrounding habitats in several studies [959]. Reported drawbacks or limits include: ditch management had negative or no clear effects on some farmland bird species or plants in some studies [135]; raising water levels resulted in a net loss of plant species in one study, did not affect lapwing foraging rate in another, re\u2011wetting old arable soils was reported as not effective for reducing nutrient levels and restoring species\u2011rich grassland in a review, and unflooded pastures contained high biomass of soil macroinvertebrates important to breeding waders in one study [121]; created ponds sometimes had different species composition than natural ponds, numbers of species were similar or lower depending on water permanence, and populations in created ponds were less stable in one study [869]; songbirds did not appear to be affected by pond creation in one case [359]; constructed wetlands had fewer fish species than natural wetlands in one study [153]. An evidence gap was identified for managing ditches specifically to benefit bats, with no studies found evaluating effects on bat populations [1944].",

    "relevant_summary": "\u2022 Beetle banks: In the UK, beetle banks had higher densities of harvest mouse nests than field margins (population: abundance) [2393]. Across four UK studies on Lepidoptera, beetle banks had lower butterfly richness than hedgerows and similar macro\u2011moth richness to conventionally managed margins; caterpillar abundance was similar to field margins and crop fields; adult butterfly abundance was lower than along hedgerows; micro\u2011moth richness and abundance were higher than on conventionally managed margins under agri\u2011environment management, while macro\u2011moths were similar [3927].\n\u2022 Planting/providing/maintaining hedgerows: In Madagascar cultivated areas, reptile communities with hedges were more similar to forests, and more reptile species occurred only where hedges were present, than in areas without hedges (community composition) [3519]. In the UK, Ireland and Canada, established hedgerows had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than beetle banks, crops, pasture or grass margins without hedgerows; one study found similar butterfly richness to grass banks; planting certain shrubs (gorse, oak, blackthorn) within hedgerows supported more arthropod species than hawthorn; moths flew parallel to hedgerows more often near them (behaviour) [3976]. For mammals, UK and Switzerland studies found that retaining/enhancing or establishing hedgerows alongside arable land was associated with higher brown hare density in arable sites (not grassland) and increased small mammal abundance, while Irish hare numbers did not increase [2383].\n\u2022 Managing hedgerows: Across studies from the UK and Switzerland, hedge management for wildlife was associated with increased berry yields, plant and invertebrate diversity/richness, and farmland bird diversity/abundance, but other studies found no effects on plant richness, bumblebee queens, or farmland birds; some mixed/adverse effects included reduced hawthorn berry yield when fruit\u2011bearing wood was removed [116]. For bats in the UK, hedges trimmed \u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for two of eight species/groups than hedges trimmed the previous winter; pipistrelle activity did not differ between agri\u2011environment managed and conventional hedges [1943]. No studies were found on managing hedgerows for mammals [2382].\n\u2022 Stone\u2011faced hedge banks: No evidence was found on effects of managing stone\u2011faced hedge banks for farmland wildlife [73].",

In the UK, Ireland and Canada, established hedgerows had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies and moths than beetle banks, crops, pasture or grass margins without hedgerows; one study found similar butterfly richness to grass banks; planting certain shrubs (gorse, oak, blackthorn) within hedgerows supported more arthropod species than hawthorn; moths flew parallel to hedgerows more often near them (behaviour) [3976].
