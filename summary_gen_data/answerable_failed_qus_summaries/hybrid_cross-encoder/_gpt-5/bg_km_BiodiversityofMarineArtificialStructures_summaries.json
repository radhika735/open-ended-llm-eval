Species richness/diversity frequently increased with grooves and small ridges/ledges (often alongside pits/other features), but several studies reported no increase or mixed effects depending on size/arrangement, shore level, site, or presence of additional features [3473, 3474]. Comparisons within structured designs reported that grooves often supported higher species richness than adjacent small ridges/ledges, though diversity patterns could depend on feature depth/height [3473, 3464]. For large ridges/ledges, diversity and overall abundance increased in some cases (often with grooves/small protrusions), but other studies reported no increase in richness; certain invertebrates (e.g., mussels or limpets) increased while barnacles did not, and rockweed increased in one study [3465]. Abundance responses for macroalgae and invertebrates to grooves and small ridges/ledges were also variable, with increases in some studies and no or mixed effects in others, including taxon-specific outcomes such as higher oyster or mobile invertebrate abundances in grooves relative to small ledges in some comparisons [3473, 3474, 3464]. Fish responses were generally limited, with fish richness and abundance often unchanged by grooves and small ridges/ledges, though some studies recorded increased richness/abundance or behavioral changes (e.g., more feeding activity) in treatments that included grooves and/or large ledges [3473, 3474, 3465].",

Groove habitats and small ridges/ledges sometimes altered macroalgae\u2013invertebrate community composition and supported species absent from flat controls, though effects varied with feature size, arrangement, shore level, and site (3474). Species richness/diversity often increased with grooves and small ridges/ledges, but several studies reported mixed or no change; partially covering features and specific size/arrangements influenced outcomes (3474). Where directly compared, small ridges/ledges tended to support lower richness and abundance of mobile invertebrates and oysters than adjacent grooves, while fish richness and abundance were similar between ridges/ledges and grooves (3464). Large ledges/ridges, often combined with grooves or protrusions, increased overall abundance and diversity, boosted rockweed, and increased mussel or limpet abundance, while barnacles and juvenile salmon abundance did not increase; juvenile salmon feeding activity increased (3465). For fish associated with small grooves/ridges/ledges, richness often did not increase and abundance generally did not change, though benthic fishes spent more time interacting with structured surfaces and sometimes took fewer bites (3474).",
