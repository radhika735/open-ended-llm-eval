Using reduced tillage has often been associated with more weeds than conventional tillage in some or all comparisons across multiple countries including the USA, with one USA study also reporting different weed community composition under reduced tillage [1399]. Using no tillage shows mixed weed outcomes across studies including the USA, with some comparisons finding more weeds, others fewer, and some similar, and similar numbers of predatory mites in USA soils under no-till versus tilled systems [1397]. Additional non-chemical methods tested for weed control include cutting, infection with fungal pathogens against creeping thistle, using weevils to transmit rust pathogens to creeping thistle, and achieving long-term control via lenient grazing; breed-specific grazing differences were also noted (Hebridean sheep grazed more purple moor grass than Swaledale) [123].",

Creating beetle banks increased predator numbers in adjacent crops according to a review, produced the greatest pest reductions closest to the banks, and was associated with fewer pests in fields with beetle banks; potential economic savings were reported when banks prevented pests reaching spray thresholds; crops studied included maize [729].
