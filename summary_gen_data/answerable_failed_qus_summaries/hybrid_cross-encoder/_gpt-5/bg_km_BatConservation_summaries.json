A review reported 72 bat species using boxes, 18 commonly, and 31 as maternity roosts (1024). Modifying artificial roosts to reduce internal temperatures was associated with higher bat numbers in two building roosts in Spain (2052). Design and placement can enhance use: studies found higher occupancy with certain designs (e.g., black or concrete boxes; larger or multi-compartment boxes; rocket boxes for Indiana bats), and higher occupancy on buildings than trees; orientation/sun exposure and site context also influenced occupancy (1024). Reported drawbacks or limitations include frequent low occupancy (22 studies with 0\\u201349% occupancy), non-use by bats displaced from buildings despite multiple box designs, and lack of maternity colony use of heated boxes at monitored sites (1024, 2052). An evidence gap remains regarding effects of providing bat boxes, grilles, or roost improvements on farmland wildlife, with no direct quantitative studies found (95).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1024\",\n    \"2052\",\n    \"95\"\n  ]\n}"

A replicated site comparison in Portugal also reported higher overall bat activity and different species composition on farms with few or no chemical inputs versus high-input farms [2331]. Organic farming (a practice typically involving reduced chemical inputs) was assessed in 12 studies across Europe, USA, Canada and Chile; five of seven studies found no difference in bat species richness between organic and non-organic farms while two found more species on organic farms, and nine abundance-focused studies reported mixed results with some finding no difference and others reporting higher overall activity, feeding activity, or species-specific activity on organic farms; additional UK and France studies reported higher activity for certain species or habitats on organic farms [961].",

Managing hedges showed variable results in the UK: hedges trimmed \\u22653 years prior had more bat species recorded and higher activity for two of eight species/species groups than hedges trimmed the previous winter, whereas hedges managed for wildlife on agri-environment farms showed no difference in pipistrelle activity compared to hedges on conventional farms (1,943). In Canada, agricultural landscapes with smaller fields had higher activity for six of seven bat species than landscapes with larger fields (1,939). No studies were found evaluating the effects of planting new hedges (1,942) or managing ditches to benefit bats (1,944).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"1940\",\n    \"1941\",\n    \"1943\",\n    \"1939\",\n    \"1942\",\n    \"1944\"\n  ]\n}"

Twenty-seven studies were in Europe, nine studies were in North America, four studies were in Australia, two studies were in South America, and one study was a worldwide review.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\\nPOPULATION RESPONSE (0 STUDIES)\\nBEHAVIOUR (44 STUDIES)\\n\\nUptake (9 studies): Nine replicated studies in Europe\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that the number of bats using bat boxes increased by 2\\u201310 times up to 10 years after installation.\\nUse (43 studies): Forty-one of 43 studies (including 34 replicated studies and two reviews) in Europe, the USA, South America, and Australia found that bats used bat boxes installed in forest or woodland, forestry plantations, farmland, pasture, wetlands, urban areas and buildings, bridges, underpasses\\u00a0or unknown habitats. The other two studies in the USA\\u00a0and UK\\u00a0found that bats displaced from buildings did not use any of 43 bat houses of four different designs\\u00a0or 12 heated bat boxes of one design. One review\\u00a0of 109 studies across Europe, North America and Asia found that 72 bat species used bat boxes, although only 18 species commonly used them, and 31 species used them as maternity roosts. Twenty-two studies (including 17 replicated studies, one before-and-after study and two reviews)\\u00a0found bats occupying less than half of bat boxes provided (0\\u201349%). Nine replicated studies\\u00a0found bats occupying more than half of bat boxes provided (54\\u2013100%).\\n\\nOTHER (23 STUDIES)\\n\\nBat box design (16 studies): Three studies in Germany, Portugal\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found that bats used black bat boxes more than grey, white\\u00a0or wooden\\u00a0boxes. One of two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in larger bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that bats used both resin and wood cylindrical bat boxes, but another study in the USA\\u00a0found that resin bat boxes became occupied more quickly than wood boxes. One study in the UK\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in concrete than wooden bat boxes. One study in the USA\\u00a0found that Indiana bats used rocket boxes more than wooden bat boxes or bark-mimic roosts. One study in Spain\\u00a0found that more bats occupied bat boxes that had two compartments than one compartment in the breeding season. One study in Lithuania\\u00a0found that bat breeding colonies occupied standard and four/five chamber bat boxes and individuals occupied flat bat boxes. Four studies in the USA, UK, Spain\\u00a0and Australia\\u00a0found bats selecting four of nine, three of five, three of four and one of five bat box designs. One study in the UK\\u00a0found that different bat box designs were used by different species. One study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found that bat boxes simulating tree trunks were used by 100% of bats and in group sizes similar to natural roosts.\\nBat box position (11 studies): Three studies in Germany, Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found that bat box orientation and/or the amount of exposure to sunlight affected bat occupancy, and one study in Spain\\u00a0found that orientation did not have a significant effect on occupancy. Two studies in the UK\\u00a0and Italy\\u00a0found that bat box height affected occupancy, and two studies in Spain\\u00a0and the USA\\u00a0found no effect of height. Two studies in the USA\\u00a0and Spain\\u00a0found higher occupancy of bat boxes on buildings than on trees. One study in Australia\\u00a0found that bat boxes were occupied more often in farm forestry sites than in native forest, one study in Poland\\u00a0found higher occupancy in pine relative to mixed deciduous stands, and one study in Costa Rica\\u00a0found higher occupancy in forest fragments than in pasture. One study in the USA\\u00a0found higher occupancy rates in areas where bats were known to roost prior to installing bat boxes. One review in the UK\\u00a0found that bat boxes were more likely to be occupied when a greater number of bat boxes were installed across a site.\"\n}"
