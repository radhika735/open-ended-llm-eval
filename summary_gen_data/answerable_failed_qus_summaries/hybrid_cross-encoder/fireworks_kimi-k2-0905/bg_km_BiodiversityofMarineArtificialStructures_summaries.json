    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions can increase invertebrate abundance on subtidal artificial structures. Creating hole habitats (>50 mm) on subtidal artificial structures increased the abundance of brown crabs on and around structures, but not other mobile invertebrates (Action ID: 3434). Creating short flexible habitats (1\u201350 mm) on subtidal artificial structures had mixed effects on mobile and/or non-mobile invertebrate abundance on and around structure surfaces, depending on the survey week, species group, flexible habitat length, or site (Action ID: 3450). Creating long flexible habitats (>50 mm) had mixed effects on mobile and non-mobile invertebrate abundance, depending on species group and survey week or flexible habitat length and density (Action ID: 3451). Creating grooved habitats and small protrusions, ridges or ledges (1\u201350 mm) showed mixed effects on invertebrate abundance depending on structure surface orientation (Action ID: 3452). Creating groove habitats (1\u201350 mm) and pit habitats (1\u201350 mm) both had mixed effects on invertebrate abundances that varied by species group (Action IDs: 3448, 3455). Creating textured surfaces (\u22641 mm) also had mixed effects on non-mobile invertebrate abundance depending on site (Action ID: 3449). Transplanting or seeding organisms onto subtidal artificial structures, particularly oysters, successfully increased invertebrate abundance and community composition in some cases while having varying effects for different species (Action ID: 3471). Creating artificial reefs with different 3-D structures and materials showed no consistent differences in overall invertebrate abundances between different reef structures and materials (Action ID: 2259).",
