    "relevant_summary": "Altering livestock grazing practices has various effects on shrubland vegetation. Increasing the number of livestock can lead to a decline in common heather and dwarf shrub cover [1628]. However, it can also result in an increase in heather cover, as well as an increase in the number of common heather and cross-leaved heath seedlings [1628]. In some cases, increasing livestock numbers may not alter shrub cover at all, or have mixed effects [1628]. Grazing can also affect grass and vegetation height. For instance, using grazing to control grass has been found to increase the cover of wavy-hair grass and reduce grass height [1646]. Increasing the number of livestock has been shown to decrease overall vegetation height [1628]. When it comes to species diversity, areas with high livestock density may have a higher number of plant species, though in some cases, the number of species may decrease or show no change [1628].\n\nExcluding livestock from shrublands using fences has also been studied. Fencing has been found to increase shrub cover, abundance, and biomass [1545]. Specifically, heather presence and cover were higher in fenced areas in some studies [1545]. On the other hand, some studies found that fencing could lead to a decrease in the cover of woody plants, or have mixed or no effect on shrub cover [1545]. In terms of other vegetation, fencing has been observed to lead to a decline in grass cover in some instances, while in others, it did not alter or even increased grass cover [1545]. Fencing has also been found to have mixed or no effect on herb cover [1545].",

A study in the USA found that burning did not change the cover of two of three grass species studied [1721]. Grazing is another action that can be taken.
