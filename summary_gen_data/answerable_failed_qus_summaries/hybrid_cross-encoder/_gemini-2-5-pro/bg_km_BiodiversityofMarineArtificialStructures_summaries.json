However, the creation of rock pools on an intertidal artificial structure did not lead to an increase in fish species richness (3476). In three studies, it was found that the depth of the rock pools had no effect on the species richness (3476), but another study found that tilted pools had a higher species richness than horizontal pools (3476). In contrast to the findings for rock pools, one study found that creating small swim-through habitats on intertidal artificial structures did not increase the species richness of mobile invertebrates (3468).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3476\",\n    \"3467\",\n    \"3468\"\n  ]\n}"
