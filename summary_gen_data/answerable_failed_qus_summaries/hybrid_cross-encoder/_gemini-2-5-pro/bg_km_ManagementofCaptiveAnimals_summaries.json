Some studies reported that 30-71% of females produced viable eggs, with success often depending on the hormone combination and dosage, while other studies found no increase in egg production (883). Some studies also reported that eggs induced by hormone treatment were successfully raised to tadpoles or froglets, while others noted high mortality rates before or after hatching (883).",
