    "relevant_summary": "The most effective actions for increasing natural enemy populations on farmland include several habitat management and chemical control strategies. Creating beetle banks provides habitat for natural enemies, with studies finding higher numbers of invertebrate predators on beetle banks compared to surrounding crops, though effects varied with time and location (Action 729, 651). Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops shows mixed results, with some studies finding more natural enemies in natural ground cover, particularly short-term effects for most natural enemy groups (Action 720). \n\nPlanting specific vegetation can attract and support natural enemies. Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three of four studies, with one replicated, randomised, controlled trial showing increased natural enemy populations (Action 724). Planting flowers in strips led to more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, with two replicated studies from the USA showing positive effects (Action 1400). Planting hedgerows resulted in more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Action 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species (Action 118).\n\nChemical attraction methods can also be effective. Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased natural enemy populations in five of 13 studies from multiple continents, though eight studies found positive effects that varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Two of four studies found higher chemical doses attracted more enemies (Action 754).\n\nManagement practices that reduce pesticide impacts support natural enemy populations. Delaying herbicide use resulted in more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage while considering natural enemy activity, though effects on natural enemy populations were not directly monitored (Action 726).\n\nMass-emergence devices showed limited effectiveness, with one study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775). Adding compost to soil showed mixed results, with one study finding similar ratios of natural enemies to pests and similar percentages of pests consumed by natural enemies in plots with or without added compost (Action 1392).",

Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies in three of four studies, with one replicated, randomised, controlled trial showing increased natural enemy populations (Action 724). Planting flowers in strips led to more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, with two replicated studies from the USA showing positive effects (Action 1400). Planting hedgerows resulted in more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges in some comparisons (Action 1401). Planting nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species (Action 118).\\n\\nChemical attraction methods can also be effective. Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased natural enemy populations in five of 13 studies from multiple continents, though eight studies found positive effects that varied between enemy groups, sites or study dates (Action 754). Two of four studies found higher chemical doses attracted more enemies (Action 754).\\n\\nManagement practices that reduce pesticide impacts support natural enemy populations. Delaying herbicide use resulted in more natural enemies in two randomised, replicated, controlled trials from Australia and Denmark, though some but not all natural enemy groups benefited (Action 774). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage while considering natural enemy activity, though effects on natural enemy populations were not directly monitored (Action 726).\\n\\nMass-emergence devices showed limited effectiveness, with one study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site (Action 775). Adding compost to soil showed mixed results, with one study finding similar ratios of natural enemies to pests and similar percentages of pests consumed by natural enemies in plots with or without added compost (Action 1392).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"720\",\n    \"775\",\n    \"726\",\n    \"754\",\n    \"724\",\n    \"729\",\n    \"774\",\n    \"1392\",\n    \"1400\",\n    \"1401\",\n    \"651\",\n    \"118\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several natural pest control measures can have negative economic impacts on farmer profitability in North America:\n\n**Organic Farming Conversion (Action 717)**: Studies found one negative effect on yield and one mixed effect, with no or inconsistent effects in three studies. One study found net profit decreased unless produce received a premium, and another study found a negative or no effect on profit.\n\n**Cover Crops (Action 1351)**: Six replicated, controlled studies from the USA found lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons. These yield reductions represent direct revenue losses for farmers.\n\n**Alley Cropping (Action 718)**: One controlled study from the USA found lower yield and lower profit in alley cropped plots. Another study from the Philippines reported similar or lower yields. One study found lower costs but also lower profit in alley cropped plots.\n\n**Push-Pull Systems (Action 753)**: One study found higher production costs in the first year, though costs became equal or lower in following years.\n\n**Allelopathic Plant Residues (Action 728)**: Two of three studies found crop growth was inhibited by allelopathic plant remains. Three randomised, replicated, controlled studies found positive, negative and mixed effects on yield when comparing amended plots with weeded controls. One study found that amending soils increased profit compared to unweeded controls, but not compared to weeded controls.\n\n**Planted Flower Strips (Action 1360)**: One replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found smaller lettuces in fields planted with flowers in five out of six configurations.\n\nThese negative impacts primarily manifest as reduced yields, higher implementation costs, lower profits, and in some cases, crop growth inhibition during transition periods.",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available action documents, farmers in the USA have several natural weed control methods available. Allelopathic plant incorporation (action 728) involves incorporating plant remains into soil that produce weed-controlling chemicals, with six studies finding reductions in weed growth though effects varied between years and weed groups. Cover crops (action 1394) can be grown in arable fields, with four studies finding fewer weeds in plots with cover crops compared to plots without them, though some studies found inconsistent effects. Competitive planting (action 722) involves growing plants that compete with damaging weeds, with all nine studies finding reduced weed plant weight or ground cover. Crop rotation (action 1396) was shown in one study to reduce weed biomass when using a canola-wheat sequence compared to wheat-wheat sequence. Tillage management offers multiple approaches: reduced tillage (action 1399) showed more weeds in most comparisons according to seven studies, while no-tillage (action 1397) had inconsistent effects with sometimes more and sometimes fewer weeds across multiple studies. General tillage reduction (action 126) increased numbers of some weeds according to studies across European countries. Mixed pasture systems (action 721) showed reduced weeds in two studies comparing mixed to monoculture pasture. Ground cover management in orchards and vineyards (action 1395) found fewer weeds in one comparison and more weeds in another. Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops (action 720) provided weed suppression benefits. Converting to organic farming (action 717) found more weeds in organically farmed fields in three studies, though effects varied between crops and years. Surface mulching (action 1650) was tested for grass control though showed limited effectiveness in one study.",

Two studies found that crop type affected the number of weeds under different tillage regimes.\\nOne small replicated trial in the UK compared bird numbers under two different forms of reduced tillage, and found more birds from species that make up the \\u2018Farmland Bird Index\\u2019 on broadcast than non-inversion tillage fields.\\nTwo studies looked at the long-term effects of reduced tillage on earthworms (after ten years). One study found higher earthworm biomass under reduced tillage, the other study found earthworm abundance was the same between conventional and reduced tillage plots.\\nThree of the studies mentioned above did not distinguish between the effects of reducing tillage and reduced pesticide and/or fertilizer inputs.\"\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence from action documents, several alternative pest management methods are available for perennial tree crops like orchards besides using insecticides. Ground cover management shows promise, with action 1395 indicating that planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards can affect pest regulation, with some studies finding more leafhopper eggs parasitized in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows, though results were inconsistent across studies. Physical exclusion methods are effective, as action 886 demonstrates that excluding ants that protect pests using glue or pesticide barriers can reduce pest numbers and increase parasitism by natural enemies in crops including cherry, grape, grapefruit, orange, and pecan trees. Push-pull systems represent another alternative approach, with action 753 showing that combining trap and repellent crops increased parasitism of stem borer larvae and resulted in fewer pests and higher yields in some studies. Chemical attractants for natural enemies offer potential benefits, as action 754 found that using chemicals to attract natural enemies increased parasitism in some studies and resulted in more natural enemies, though effects varied between enemy groups, sites, and study dates across crops including apple, grape, grapefruit, and orange. Beneficial insect conservation can be enhanced through habitat management, with action 118 showing that planting nettle strips resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species, including green lacewings that were only found on nettles. Integrated approaches such as incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for pest control decisions (action 726) resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests in tomato studies. Alley cropping (action 718) showed mixed results on pest management, with some studies finding fewer pests and others finding variable effects depending on pest groups and study years. Conversion to organic farming (action 895) demonstrated higher soil organism diversity and fruit quality in some orchard studies, though with mixed effects on yields.",

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence shows that various habitat manipulation strategies within crop fields can effectively boost natural enemy numbers. Beetle banks create refuge habitats that increase predator numbers, with four studies and a review finding more invertebrate predators on beetle banks than in surrounding crops (Action 729). Six studies from Canada, the UK and USA found that predators increased in adjacent crops near beetle banks, though effects varied with time and movement of predators from banks to crops was sometimes slow (Action 729).\n\nGrowing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attractive to natural enemies has shown positive results, with three studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya (including one randomised controlled trial) finding higher numbers of natural enemies in plots with such plants, while all four studies found decreased pest populations or damage (Action 724). \n\nFlower strips planted within agricultural systems demonstrate benefits for natural enemies, with two replicated studies from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with planted flower strips compared to fields without them, and two controlled studies from Italy finding more natural enemies in planted flower strips than on bare ground (Action 1400). Three replicated studies from Italy and the USA found greater pest reduction or higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms with planted flower strips (Action 1400).\n\nHedgerows provide habitat that supports natural enemies, with one study from the USA finding more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges, and a higher proportion of pest eggs parasitized in tomato fields with hedgerows up to 100m into the crop (Action 1401). Intercropping systems also boost beneficial insects, with three randomised controlled studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK finding increased ground beetle abundance when intercropping cabbage with French beans or clover (Action 124).\n\nField margin management contributes to natural enemy populations, with studies showing that nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species, with three insect families including green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118). Uncultivated margins around fields support more invertebrates including beneficial species, with 19 studies from European countries finding they support more invertebrates and higher plant diversity than conventionally managed margins (Action 63).",

One study found that genetically modified maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) toxin was effective against European corn borer.\n\nCrop rotation systems have shown pest reduction benefits (Action 719). Three studies and a review found crop rotation reduced pest populations and crop diseases in at least one year or site, with two studies finding that fewer insecticide treatments were needed on rotated plots. The effectiveness varied depending on rotation crops used, with crops studied including maize among others.\n\nAlley cropping shows mixed results for pest control (Action 718). Two of four replicated, controlled studies found more pests in alley cropped plots, while one study found fewer pests and effects varied with pest group and between years.\n\nConverting to organic farming systems shows limited evidence for pest reduction in maize specifically (Action 717).

One replicated, controlled study from Australia found that leaving part of crops unharvested increased predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs in unharvested strips (Action 725). In perennial crop systems specifically, one replicated, randomized, controlled study from the USA found that more leafhopper eggs were parasitized in plots with cover crops compared to bare fallows in orchards or vineyards, though this was only observed in one of six comparisons (Action 1395). Two additional replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found inconsistent differences or no differences in parasitism of leafhopper eggs between plots with or without ground cover (Action 1395). The use of mass-emergence devices showed mixed results, with one randomised, replicated, controlled study in Switzerland finding higher parasitism at one site but no effect at another site when used in urban areas (Action 775). Four studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya found that growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals attracting natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies, including in fruit trees, though one study found no effect on parasitism when the plant used was not attractive to natural enemies in laboratory studies (Action 724). Alley cropping systems showed variable results, with two of four studies from Kenya and the USA finding that effects on parasitism varied between study sites, sampling dates, pest life stages or crop alley width, while two studies found no effect on parasitism (Action 718). One controlled study from New Zealand found that using parasitism rates to inform spraying decisions resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests, though this was tested on tomato rather than perennial crops (Action 726).",

    "relevant_summary": "From North American studies, several different farming systems show varying effects on crop yields compared to conventional farming. Organic farming systems show mixed yield effects, with six randomized, replicated, controlled studies from North America finding one positive effect, one negative effect, one mixed effect, and no or inconsistent effects in three studies (Action 717). One study found net profit increased if produce received a premium, but otherwise profit decreased (Action 717). One replicated trial in Canada found lower yields in organically managed soils compared to conventional systems (Action 895).\n\nCrop rotation systems in potato farming from Canada and the USA demonstrate positive yield impacts, with three out of five replicated, controlled studies (two also randomized) finding that crop rotation increased crop yield in some years or with certain rotation crops, while two other studies found yield increases and decreases depending on rotation crops used (Action 719). One study also found that crop rotation increased profit (Action 719).\n\nTillage practice modifications show variable results. For reduced tillage systems, nine replicated, controlled studies from the USA found higher cereal yields compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, though three of these studies also found lower cereal yields in some comparisons (Action 1359). Five replicated, randomized, controlled studies from the USA found higher fruit or vegetable yields with reduced tillage in some comparisons, though two studies also found lower yields in some comparisons (Action 1359). For no-tillage systems, eight replicated, controlled studies from the USA found higher crop yields compared to conventional tillage in some or all comparisons, while seven studies found lower crop yields in some or all comparisons (Action 1355).\n\nCover crop systems from the USA show predominantly negative to neutral yield effects, with six replicated, controlled studies (five randomized) finding lower cash crop yields in plots with winter cover crops compared to plots without them in some comparisons, while three studies found higher yields and eight studies found inconsistent differences (Action 1351). Studies found higher cash crop yields in plots that had legumes as winter cover crops compared to non-legumes (Action 1351).\n\nOrganic fertilizer use compared to inorganic fertilizers from USA studies shows mixed results, with three replicated, randomized, controlled studies finding lower yields with organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer in some or all comparisons, while four studies from other regions found higher yields in some comparisons (Action 1350). Compost addition studies from the USA show variable effects, with three studies finding higher crop yields in plots with added compost in some or all comparisons, two studies finding inconsistent differences, and three studies finding similar yields with or without added compost (Action 1346).",

One replicated trial found increased numbers of soil animals and earthworms under reduced tillage. One controlled, replicated trial found mixed effects on microbe diversity depending on time of sampling. Two, (including one controlled, replicated trial) found no effect of reduced tillage on earthworm activity or microbe activity.\\nCompaction: Five studies from Australia, Canada, and Europe measured the effect of controlled traffic and reduced tillage on compacted soils. Of these, two (including one before-and-after trial and one replicated trial) found reduced compaction and subsequent effects (reduced water runoff, for example) under controlled traffic, and one also found that crop yields increased under no-tillage. Three replicated trials, including one site comparison study, found higher compaction under reduced tillage. \\nDrought: Three replicated trials from Europe and India (one also randomized) found the size of soil cracks decreased, and ability of soil to absorb water and soil water content increased with conventional ploughing and sub-soiling. \\nErosion: Nine replicated trials from Brazil, Europe, India, Nigeria and the USA, and one review showed mixed results of tillage on soil erosion. Seven trials (one also controlled and randomized) showed reduced soil loss and runoff under reduced tillage compared to conventional ploughing. One trial showed no differences between tillage systems, but demonstrated that across-slope cultivation reduced soil loss compared to up-and-downslope cultivation. Two trials showed that no-tillage increased soil loss in the absence of crop cover.\\nSoil organic carbon: Twelve studies from Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the USA compared the effect of no-tillage and conventionally tilled systems on soil organic carbon. All (including two randomized, five replicated, two randomized, replicated, and one controlled, randomized, replicated) found higher soil organic carbon in soils under a no-tillage or reduced tillage system compared to conventionally tilled soil. One review showed that no-tillage with cover cropping and manure application increases soil organic carbon.

    "relevant_summary": "Several companion planting methods are available to enhance natural pest control. Push-pull systems combine trap and repellent crops, with studies from Kenya finding increased parasitism of stem borer larvae, more natural predators, fewer pests and witchweeds, less pest damage, and higher yields (Action 753). Intercropping involves planting more than one crop per field, with studies from the Netherlands, Poland and the UK showing increased ground beetle abundance when cabbage was intercropped with French beans or clover (Action 124). Alley cropping uses hedgerows of trees or shrubs between crop alleys, with one study from Kenya finding more wasps and spiders but fewer ladybirds, and effects varying between study sites and pest life stages (Action 718). Planting flowers for pest regulation has shown greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields with planted flower strips according to studies from Italy and the USA (Action 1400). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies resulted in higher numbers of natural enemies and decreased pest populations or damage across studies from China, Germany, India and Kenya (Action 724). Cover crops in arable fields can provide pest regulation benefits, with some studies finding fewer aphids and reduced disease severity (Action 1394). Natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops shows mixed effects, with some studies finding more natural enemies and fewer pests in fruit tree and vine systems (Action 720). Mixed pastures reduce weeds and some pest groups compared to monoculture systems according to studies from North America (Action 721). Planting hedgerows around fields increases parasitism of pest eggs and provides more natural enemies, with one study from the USA finding higher parasitism rates in tomato fields with hedgerows compared to fields with weedy edges (Action 1401).",

    "relevant_summary": "The evidence on soil amendments and management practices for weed control shows mixed results. Incorporating plant remains into soil that produce weed-controlling chemicals (allelopathic plant remains) showed varied effectiveness: six studies found three studies with reduced weed growth and three with effects varying between years, weed groups, or weeding methods; four additional studies found two with reduced weed growth but one where residues applied too far in advance had reverse effects, and two with effects varying between trials, weed species or residue type (Action 728). However, two studies found the weed-reducing effect did not last beyond a few days or weeks after residue incorporation (Action 728).\n\nSoil tillage practices also affect weed populations. No tillage compared to reduced tillage showed mixed results: four studies found fewer weeds in some or all comparisons, but two of these also found more weeds in some comparisons; one study found more weeds with no tillage, and one found similar weed amounts (Action 1398). One study found fewer weed species with no tillage compared to reduced tillage (Action 1398).\n\nCover crops in arable fields demonstrated variable weed control effects. Four studies found fewer weeds with cover crops in some or all comparisons, while one study found more weeds with winter cover crops in some comparisons, two studies found inconsistent effects, and one found similar weed amounts compared to plots without cover crops (Action 1394). One study found fewer weed species with winter cover crops in one of three comparisons (Action 1394).\n\nMixed organic and inorganic soil amendments increased soil microbial biomass and activity, reduced soil erosion, and increased soil organic carbon and nutrients, though their direct effects on weeds were not specifically documented (Action 902). Ground cover using mulch after restoration planting increased total plant cover in one study (Action 1240).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative management strategies to routine, full-field cutting exist for pest control in pasture and grassland systems:\n\n**Grazing instead of cutting** (Action 885): Studies show mixed effects on natural enemies and pests, with some species and groups affected on some dates but not others. One of five studies found more pests when grazing was used instead of cutting, while two studies found no effect on pests.\n\n**Delayed mowing or first grazing** (Action 727): One of two studies found more pest insects in late-cut plots, while one found no effect. This strategy showed mixed effects on natural enemies, with some predator groups affected differently.\n\n**Partial cutting/leaving areas uncut** (Action 725): Eight studies tested leaving part of the pasture uncut. Two studies found a decrease in pest numbers in partially cut plots, while two other studies found an increase in pest numbers. The strategy showed benefits for natural enemies, with three studies finding increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders in partially cut areas, and two studies finding higher predator-to-pest ratios.\n\n**Rotational mowing** (Action 3966): This strategy involves mowing strips in alternate years or leaving rotational areas uncut. Studies focused primarily on butterfly and moth conservation rather than pest control specifically.\n\n**Mixed pasture systems** (Action 721): Five studies from North America found that mixed pastures compared to monocultures showed one study with fewer pests, two studies with reductions in some pest groups, one study with no effect, and one with more pests.\n\n**Reduced cutting frequency** (Action 3961): Studies primarily examined effects on butterflies and moths rather than pest control, showing mixed results for different species.\n\n**Raised mowing height** (Action 3513): Limited evidence available, with one study focusing on reptile behavior rather than pest control effects.",

For natural enemies and pest control, studies show mixed results - three studies found varying effects between different groups of natural enemies when comparing natural versus bare ground covers, while two found no difference in enemy numbers in crop canopies (Action 720). In pastures and crops that were left partially uncut, three studies found increased abundance of predatory insects or spiders in the crop field or pasture area, and four studies found more predators in the unharvested or unmown areas themselves (Action 725). Soil health benefits are consistently documented, with four studies showing increased microbial biomass in soils with ground cover compared to bare or tilled soils (Action 2304). For perennial crop systems specifically, twelve studies found more organic matter in soils with ground cover compared to soils without ground cover, and multiple studies documented increased nitrogen levels in covered soils (Action 1367). Ground cover also provided erosion control benefits, with six studies finding less soil erosion in covered areas compared to bare or tilled soils, and four studies showing improved soil aggregate water-stability (Action 1367). Additionally, one study found that olive groves with natural ground cover had higher reptile species richness and diversity than those with bare ground, and more reptiles overall compared to groves with bare ground (Action 3526).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, beneficial interventions for reducing pest populations include several integrated pest management approaches. Isolating colonies of beneficial ants increases predatory ant occupation in trees, resulting in lower pest damage and higher yields (action 773). Planting flower strips shows greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields (action 1400). Using pesticides only when pests reach threshold levels provides satisfactory pest control while requiring fewer pesticide applications and lower production costs (action 750). Push-pull cropping systems that combine trap and repellent crops increase parasitism of pest larvae, reduce pest numbers, and provide higher yields and economic benefits (action 753). Excluding ants that protect pests increases parasitism by natural enemies and reduces pest numbers in some studies (action 886). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use results in acceptable levels of crop damage (action 726). Adding compost to soil reduces some crop diseases (action 1392). Planting hedgerows increases parasitism of pest eggs and reduces pest numbers while increasing natural enemy populations (action 1401). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies increases parasitism and reduces pest numbers in some studies (action 754). Growing non-crop plants that produce chemicals to attract natural enemies increases natural enemy numbers and decreases pest populations and damage while increasing crop yields (action 724). Using mass-emergence devices can increase parasitism rates at some sites (action 775). Leaving part of crops unharvested increases predation and parasitism rates of pest eggs while providing mixed effects on pest numbers (action 725). Mixed pasture systems reduce some pest groups compared to monocultures (action 721). Altering timing of insecticide use can reduce pests and disease damage when applied early rather than late in the growing season (action 723).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several alternatives to beetle banks can provide refuge for natural enemies from farming operations. Plant nectar flower mixture/wildflower strips (Action 442) have been shown to have positive effects on invertebrates, with fifty out of sixty-five studies reporting benefits including increased abundance, species richness/diversity, and evidence that flower strips supported ground beetle species that were rarely found in crops. Plant grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields (Action 246) increased arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity according to nineteen studies from multiple European countries. Plant nettle strips (Action 118) resulted in a higher number of aphid predator species in field margins, with three insect families including green lacewings only found on nettles. Provide or retain set-aside areas in farmland (Action 156) showed benefits to wildlife groups in twenty studies, providing habitat for overwintering and refuge. Leave overwinter stubbles (Action 695) provides benefits to plants, insects, spiders, mammals and farmland birds, with thirteen studies finding evidence of benefits including higher densities of farmland birds in winter. Leave field margins unsprayed within the crop as conservation headlands (Action 29) creates refuge areas within fields. Plant new hedges (Action 752) can provide habitat for natural enemies, with studies from France and China finding more natural enemies in hedges than in adjacent crops, though effects varied between crop types, hedge species and years. Reduce tillage (Action 126) had positive effects on earthworms and some invertebrates according to thirty-four studies, with increased biomass, species richness or abundance of earthworms and greater abundance of some invertebrates. Take field corners out of management (Action 128) and create uncultivated margins around arable or pasture fields (Action 3518) also provide undisturbed refuge areas for natural enemies.",

Conversely, excluding ants that protect pests showed mixed results across different crops, with three of seven studies finding fewer pests, and effects varying between natural enemy species, sampling dates, sites, and crop varieties (Action 886).\n\nGround cover management through allowing natural regeneration beneath perennial crops shows promise, with four studies measuring pests and crop damage finding that two studies had fewer pests in regenerated versus bare ground covers, though effects varied for different pest or disease groups (Action 720).\n\nThreshold-based pesticide application is an important intervention, with studies showing that using pesticides only when pests reach threshold levels can satisfactorily control pests in two of four studies, though one study reported inadequate pest control. This approach typically requires fewer pesticide applications and results in lower production costs (Action 750).\n\nIncorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests in tomato crops, though this was based on a single study (Action 726).\n\nThe evidence comes from various perennial crops including cashew, apple, grape, lemon, olive, pear, cherry, grapefruit, orange, pecan, and satsuma mandarin, though study results often showed mixed effects depending on specific conditions and pest types.",

Planting grass buffer strips/margins around arable or pasture fields increases arthropod abundance, species richness and diversity, though some studies found no clear effect on invertebrate pest populations (Action 246). Creating beetle banks provides habitat for predatory invertebrates and can result in pest reduction, with the largest pest reductions found in areas closest to beetle banks, though effects on predator movement to adjacent crops can be variable (Action 729). \n\nPlanting flower strips in fields demonstrates mixed results for pest control - some studies found greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests, while others found increased pest numbers on crops adjacent to flower strips (Action 1400). Planting nettle strips in field margins resulted in higher numbers of aphid predator species, with certain insect families like green lacewings found only on nettles (Action 118).\n\nHedgerow establishment and management provides natural pest control benefits. Planting new hedges supports higher abundance of beetles and spiders than crop fields, with literature reviews finding lower pest outbreaks in areas with new hedges (Action 538). Planting hedgerows resulted in higher proportions of parasitized pest eggs in tomato fields compared to fields with weedy edges, though only up to 100 m into the crop, and provided more natural enemies in fields with hedgerows (Action 1401). \n\nAlley cropping, which involves intercropping with trees, increases diversity of beneficial soil organisms like arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Action 903). Creating uncultivated margins around fields and taking field corners out of management provide additional structural habitat modifications that support beneficial wildlife, though their direct pest control effects require further study (Actions 190, 3518, 128).",

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several alternative strategies to routine, preventative pesticide spraying exist for managing pests in agricultural production. Threshold-based pesticide application involves using pesticides only when pests or crop damage reach specific threshold levels, which has been shown to require fewer pesticide applications and lower production costs while maintaining similar crop damage and yields compared to conventional spraying regimes (Action 750). \n\nCrop rotation systems can reduce pest populations and crop diseases, with studies finding fewer insecticide treatments were needed on rotated plots and increased crop yield in some years (Actions 1396, 719). Push-pull cropping systems, which combine trap and repellent crops, have been found to increase parasitism of stem borer larvae, result in more natural predators, fewer pests, less pest damage, and higher yields (Action 753).\n\nHabitat management approaches include planting flower strips, which can provide greater pest reduction and higher proportions of parasitized pests in fields and farms, along with increased numbers of natural enemies (Action 1400). Creating beetle banks has been shown to increase invertebrate predators and can make economic savings if they prevent pests from reaching spray thresholds (Action 729). Alley cropping systems have shown mixed results but can affect natural enemy populations and pest levels (Action 718).\n\nIncorporating biological factors into pest management decisions, such as using parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use, has resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests (Action 726). Organic farming systems have been studied as an alternative approach, showing different effects on various species populations compared to conventional farming (Action 961).",

Planting or maintaining ground cover in orchards or vineyards showed that four replicated controlled studies found more natural enemies in plots with ground cover compared to plots without ground cover, in some or all comparisons (Action 1395). Allowing natural regeneration of ground cover beneath perennial crops demonstrated that five studies found more natural enemies in natural ground cover, and four studies found fewer pests or lower crop damage, though effects varied for different pest groups (Action 720). Excluding ants that protect pests showed that three of seven studies found fewer pests, and one study found greater tree growth when ants were excluded from trees (Action 886). Isolating colonies of beneficial ants resulted in predatory ants occupying more cashew trees, leading to lower pest damage and higher yields (Action 773). Using chemicals to attract natural enemies showed that five of 13 studies found more natural enemies, three of nine studies found fewer pests, and one study found higher wheat yields (Action 754). Incorporating parasitism rates when setting thresholds for insecticide use resulted in acceptable levels of crop damage from pests in one controlled study (Action 726). Delaying herbicide use increased natural enemies in two randomized, replicated, controlled trials, and one study found fewer pests in one of two experiments (Action 774). Alley cropping showed mixed results, with some studies finding increased natural enemies like wasps and spiders, though effects on pests varied between sites and years (Action 718).",
