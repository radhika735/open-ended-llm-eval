    "relevant_summary": "Based on the action documents, several interventions are effective for creating and managing aquatic habitats for amphibians in agricultural landscapes. Creating ponds for amphibians is highly effective, with 28 studies showing that amphibians used some or all created ponds, and amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (Action 869). Created ponds were used or colonized by up to 15 naturally colonizing species and up to 10 species that reproduced (Action 869). Creating wetlands also shows similar effectiveness, with created wetlands having similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands, and 4 to 15 amphibian species using or colonizing the wetlands (Action 880). Pond restoration is effective for increasing amphibian populations, with studies showing that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action 878). Wetland restoration similarly increased numbers of amphibian species and established breeding populations, with restored wetlands being colonized by 3 to 8 amphibian species (Action 879). Managing water levels is important, with studies showing that maintaining pond water levels increased natterjack toad populations and enabled successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (Action 833). Pond deepening, de-silting and re-profiling resulted in establishment of breeding populations and increased amphibian populations (Action 817). Managing ditches under agri-environment schemes resulted in significantly higher numbers of amphibian species and abundance compared to conventional management (Action 749). Removing or controlling fish by drying out ponds increased numbers of amphibian species and breeding success (Action 826). Effectiveness of these interventions was affected by factors including pond age, permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, presence of fish, wetland design, water levels, and proximity to source ponds (Actions 869, 880, 879).",

Creating artificial hibernacula or aestivation sites has been tested, with one study in the UK finding that providing artificial hibernacula, along with other terrestrial habitat management, maintained populations of great crested newts (Action 759). Another study found that created hibernacula were used by common frog and smooth newts, but not great crested newts, and four amphibian species were found close to hibernacula at two of three sites (Action 759). Creating refuges involves adding coarse woody debris to forest floors, which showed mixed results - two studies found no effect on the number of amphibian species or overall abundance but had mixed effects on abundance of individual species, while restoration that included reintroducing coarse woody debris to the forest floor increased frog species (Action 772). Studies also found that artificial refugia were used by translocated Hamilton's frogs and hellbenders, although few were used for breeding (Action 772). One before-and-after study found that creating refugia for great crested newts, along with other interventions, maintained four populations (Action 772). Regarding coarse woody debris in forests, studies found mixed effects - one study showed that the overall response of amphibians was more negative where woody debris was retained, but migrating amphibians used clearcuts where woody debris was retained more than where it was removed (Action 843). Additionally, survival of juvenile amphibians was significantly higher in piles of woody debris than in open areas within clearcut forest (Action 843). For captive breeding, providing particular enclosure furniture including rotting logs and hollow bamboo pipes promoted egg laying in frogs, and housing frogs in enclosures with more calling, perching and laying sites led to successful breeding (Action 1876).",

    "relevant_summary": "Habitat protection has shown significant benefits for natterjack toad conservation in the UK, with populations better protected at sites with statutory habitat protection compared to unprotected areas (action ID 820). Translocation programs have been particularly successful, with studies finding that translocated natterjack toad eggs, tadpoles, juveniles or adults established breeding populations in 30-70% of cases, with re-establishing toads on dune or saltmarsh habitat being more successful than on heathland (action ID 859). Multiple translocations of wild rather than captive-bred toads showed better results (action ID 859).\n\nPond creation has proven highly effective, with studies showing that pond creation significantly increased natterjack toad populations or maintained/increased populations at 75% of sites (action ID 866). However, created ponds had lower tadpole mortality from desiccation but higher mortality from predation by invertebrates compared to natural ponds (action ID 866). Vegetation clearance has been important for maintaining and increasing natterjack toad populations and increased occupancy by natterjack toads (action ID 761).\n\nWater chemistry management through adding limestone to reduce acidification has shown mixed results - it resulted in establishment of translocated populations and increased breeding activity in some cases, but also caused high tadpole mortality and pond abandonment in others (action ID 748). Grazing management studies found that grazed plots did not have higher natterjack toad abundance than ungrazed plots, though habitat management including reintroduction of grazing maintained or increased populations (action ID 780).\n\nPublic awareness campaigns combined with other interventions have contributed to conservation success, increasing numbers of natterjack toads and creating 1,023 ponds for amphibians (action ID 831). Pond management through deepening and re-profiling, combined with other interventions, has increased natterjack toad populations (action ID 817).",

    "relevant_summary": "Captive breeding programs for amphibians show varied outcomes across different groups. For frogs, 23 of 33 studies found that amphibians produced eggs in captivity, with 17 studies finding captive-bred frogs were raised successfully to hatching, tadpoles, froglets or adults (Action 835). However, seven studies found mixed results with only 17-50% of captive populations reproducing successfully, and some species were difficult to maintain or raise to adults (Action 835). Specific survival rates for frogs included 30-88% of eggs hatching, 75% survival to metamorphosis, 17-51% survival as froglets, and 50-90% survival to adults (Action 835).\n\nFor salamanders, 4 of 6 studies found that eggs were produced successfully in captivity, with captive-bred salamanders raised to yearlings, larvae or adults (Action 838). However, egg production depended on tank habitat and was more successful in semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Action 838). One review found that four salamander species bred successfully but slimy salamanders produced eggs that did not hatch (Action 838). Japanese giant salamander eggs showed 60% survival to hatching in captivity (Action 838).\n\nSeveral challenges affect breeding success across amphibian groups. Reproductive success depends on environmental factors like temperature and simulated wet/dry seasons (Action 835). Egg and tadpole development is affected by parental care, density, and temperature (Action 835). For salamanders, larval development, body condition and survival are affected by water temperature, density and whether raised under laboratory or semi-natural conditions (Action 838).\n\nBreeding success can be enhanced through proper enclosure design. Adding rotting logs, hollow bamboo pipes and varied substrates promoted egg laying in frogs (Action 1876), and providing more calling, perching and laying sites along with simulated seasons encouraged breeding (Action 1876). Using surrogate species to refine husbandry techniques before working with target species promoted successful breeding of critically endangered frogs (Action 1862).\n\nHormone treatments show mixed results, with 9 of 10 studies finding that treatment stimulated sperm production in males, but female responses varied with only 30-71% producing viable eggs (Action 883). When hormone-induced eggs were successfully obtained, five studies found they could be raised to tadpoles, toadlets or froglets, though some studies found most toads died before or after hatching (Action 883).\n\nRelease success rates indicate that 41% of captive-bred amphibian release programs showed evidence of breeding in the wild for multiple generations, 29% showed some evidence of breeding, and 12% showed evidence of survival following release (Action 871). Head-started amphibians showed better outcomes, with six of 10 studies finding that released individuals established breeding populations or increased existing populations (Action 881).",

Pond restoration is a key approach, with studies showing it can increase numbers of amphibian species, maintain or increase populations, or increase pond occupancy and breeding success (action 878). Specific restoration techniques include deepening, de-silting or re-profiling ponds, which has resulted in establishment of breeding populations of great crested newts and translocated garlic toads, and increased populations of common frogs and tree frogs (action 817). Water level regulation is another important management practice that can increase natterjack toad populations, maintain newt populations, and enable successful breeding by dusky gopher frogs (action 833). Canopy management through removing tree canopy to reduce pond shading has helped establish breeding populations of translocated garlic toads (action 758). Chemical treatments to address water quality include adding lime to water bodies to reduce acidification, which has resulted in establishment of translocated natterjack toad populations, increased larval and egg survival of moor frogs and common frogs, and temporarily increased breeding by natterjack toads (action 748). Physical protection measures such as excluding domestic animals or wild hogs by fencing can increase larval abundance and abundance of green frog metamorphs, and has increased pond use by breeding natterjack toads when combined with other pond restoration activities (action 746). Removing specific aquatic plants is also mentioned as a management technique (action 815).",

Pond age affects use and colonization, with one study finding that survival of translocated Oregon spotted frogs increased with increasing age of created ponds (Action 865). Distance to existing ponds is a critical factor, as use or colonization of created ponds was affected by distance to existing ponds (Action 869), and numbers of species in restored wetlands were affected by proximity to source ponds (Action 879). The surrounding landscape and habitat context influences success, with colonization affected by surrounding landscape (Action 869) and numbers of amphibian species and abundance affected by surrounding habitat (Action 880).\n\nWater permanence is important, with studies finding that colonization was affected by pond permanence (Action 869), and that numbers of species were similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies (Action 869). Vegetation cover influences success, as use or colonization was affected by vegetation cover (Action 869), and amphibian abundance in created wetlands was affected by vegetation (Action 880). Fish presence is a major factor affecting breeding success, with amphibian abundance affected by fish presence (Action 880), and studies showing that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action 826) and increased breeding success of frog or newt species (Action 826).\n\nPond design characteristics influence colonization, with amphibian abundance in created wetlands affected by wetland design (Action 880). Water levels are significant, as amphibian abundance was affected by water levels (Action 880), and maintaining pond water levels enabled successful breeding (Action 833).

Distance to existing ponds is a critical factor, as use or colonization of created ponds was affected by distance to existing ponds (Action 869), and numbers of species in restored wetlands were affected by proximity to source ponds (Action 879). The surrounding landscape and habitat context influences success, with colonization affected by surrounding landscape (Action 869) and numbers of amphibian species and abundance affected by surrounding habitat (Action 880).\\n\\nWater permanence is important, with studies finding that colonization was affected by pond permanence (Action 869), and that numbers of species were similar or lower depending on the permanence of created water bodies (Action 869). Vegetation cover influences success, as use or colonization was affected by vegetation cover (Action 869), and amphibian abundance in created wetlands was affected by vegetation (Action 880). Fish presence is a major factor affecting breeding success, with amphibian abundance affected by fish presence (Action 880), and studies showing that draining ponds to eliminate fish increased numbers of amphibian species (Action 826) and increased breeding success of frog or newt species (Action 826).\\n\\nPond design characteristics influence colonization, with amphibian abundance in created wetlands affected by wetland design (Action 880). Water levels are significant, as amphibian abundance was affected by water levels (Action 880), and maintaining pond water levels enabled successful breeding (Action 833). Overall colonization rates vary significantly, with studies showing amphibians used 64-100% and reproduced in 64-68% of created ponds, or used 8-100% and reproduced in 2-62% depending on species (Action 869).\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"869\",\n    \"865\",\n    \"879\",\n    \"880\",\n    \"826\",\n    \"833\"\n  ]\n}"

    "relevant_summary": "Evidence for direct treatments for amphibians infected with chytridiomycosis shows varying effectiveness across different approaches. Antifungal treatments show the strongest evidence, with twelve of 16 studies finding that antifungal treatment cured or increased survival of amphibians with chytridiomycosis, while four studies found that treatments did not cure chytridiomycosis but reduced infection levels or had mixed results (action 882). Specifically, six of eight studies testing itraconazole found it effective at curing amphibians of chytridiomycosis, with one study finding it reduced infection levels and one finding mixed effects (action 882). However, six studies found that specific fungicides caused death or other negative side effects in amphibians (action 882). Temperature treatment demonstrates effectiveness, with four of five studies finding that increasing enclosure or water temperature to 30-37\u00b0C for over 16 hours cured frogs and toads of chytridiomycosis, though one study found that heat treatment at 30-35\u00b0C for 36 hours did not cure northern leopard frogs (action 770). Antifungal skin bacteria or peptides show mixed results, with three of four studies finding that adding antifungal bacteria to the skin of salamanders or frogs exposed to chytrid fungus did not reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or death, while one study found it prevented infection and death (action 764). One study found that adding antifungal skin bacteria to soil significantly reduced chytridiomycosis infection rate of red-backed salamanders, and three studies found that adding antifungal skin bacteria to chytrid infected amphibians reduced weight loss (action 764). Treatment with antimicrobial skin peptides before or after infection did not significantly increase survival of common toads (action 764). Field treatment approaches show limited success, with one study finding that treating wild midwife toads with fungicide, along with pond drying, reduced infection levels but did not eradicate chytridiomycosis (action 767). Immunization showed no effectiveness, with one study finding that vaccinating mountain yellow-legged frogs with formalin-killed chytrid fungus did not significantly reduce chytridiomycosis infection rate or mortality (action 765).",

    "relevant_summary": "**Riparian Buffer Benefits:** Twelve studies investigated retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest for amphibians (action 747). Six studies found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher with buffers or had mixed effects depending on species and buffer width compared to clearcutting without buffers. Four studies found that abundance and species composition in buffered areas were similar to unharvested forest. Two studies found that wider riparian buffer strips resulted in greater numbers of amphibian species and abundance.\n\n**Riparian Buffer Negative Impacts:** Two studies found that amphibian numbers and species were lower in riparian buffer areas than in unharvested forest (action 747). Six studies found mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood when comparing buffered areas to unharvested forest.\n\n**Coarse Woody Debris Benefits:** Studies on leaving coarse woody debris in forests found that felled forest areas with woody debris had more small mammal species groups than areas without woody debris (action 2647). Two of three shrew species were more numerous in areas with increased volumes of coarse woody debris. When adding woody debris to landscapes, four of five studies found areas with added woody debris had similar or higher reptile species richness compared to areas with no added debris (action 3718). Two of six studies found areas with added woody debris had higher reptile abundance.\n\n**Coarse Woody Debris Negative Impacts:** One study found that retaining or adding coarse woody debris did not increase numbers or frequency of records of small mammals (action 2647). One study found that pastures with added timber had lower abundance of rare reptile species compared to pastures without timber (action 3718). Regarding woody debris removal, one study found that debris removal increased understory vegetation cover, one found it increased young tree density, while another found it decreased young tree density (action 1213).\n\n**Snags Benefits:** Studies on leaving standing deadwood/snags showed mixed results. One study found that adding snags and woody debris had mixed effects on reptile diversity, species richness, and abundance (action 3631). One study found areas with added woody debris (including snags) had higher reptile species richness than areas with no added debris (action 3718).\n\n**Snags Negative Impacts:** Studies found that leaving dead or wildlife trees during clearcutting did not result in higher salamander abundances compared to total clearcutting and did not prevent decreases in salamander abundance compared to no harvesting (action 845). One study found that increasing standing coarse woody debris had no effect on reptile diversity, species richness, and abundance (action 3631).\n\n**Variable Retention Management Benefits:** A study found that nine bird species occurred at higher densities in stands under variable retention management compared to control stands (action 332). Patch retention harvesting contained more birds of more species than clearcut areas, retaining similar numbers to unharvested areas, and forest specialist species were found with greater frequency in patch retention plots (action 330).",

Reducing pesticide, herbicide or fertilizer use has shown positive effects, with one study in Taiwan finding that halting pesticide use along with habitat management increased a population of Taipei frogs (Action 832). Managing ditches can be effective, as one controlled, before-and-after study in the UK found that managing ditches increased common toad numbers, and one replicated site comparison study in the Netherlands found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance was significantly higher in ditches managed under agri-environment schemes compared to those managed conventionally (Action 749). Creating wetlands may also help, with fifteen studies showing that created wetlands can provide suitable habitat for amphibians, though effectiveness varies based on wetland design, vegetation, water levels, surrounding habitat, fish presence and distance to source wetlands (Action 880). However, some actions show limited effectiveness or lack evidence - one replicated, controlled study in the USA found that planting buffer strips along streams did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819). Several other potentially relevant actions such as preventing pollution from agricultural lands entering watercourses (Action 802) and restricting herbicide, fungicide and pesticide use on and around ponds (Action 787) currently have no evidence for their effects on amphibian populations.",

However, one study found that breeding failed in 48% of ponds within three years, and one systematic review of 31 great crested newt studies found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including translocations resulted in self-sustaining populations (Action 858). For habitat creation, three studies found that great crested newts established breeding populations at 57-75% of created ponds, with up to 88% of created ponds being colonized by translocated or naturally colonizing newts (Action 863). However, a systematic review found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including pond creation resulted in self-sustaining populations (Action 863). Regarding pond restoration, one replicated controlled study found that pond restoration did not increase great crested newt populations, and a systematic review found no conclusive evidence that mitigation including pond restoration resulted in self-sustaining populations (Action 878). For legal protection, three reviews found that legal protection of amphibian species was not effective at protecting populations during development, though the number of great crested newt mitigation licences issued increased to over 600 in England and Wales over 10 years (Action 779). Additional habitat management including creating artificial hibernacula along with other terrestrial habitat management maintained great crested newt populations in one study (Action 759), and creating refugia along with other interventions maintained four populations (Action 772).",

For vegetation replanting, three studies in Australia, Canada and Spain found that amphibian abundance or community composition became more similar to natural sites with time since grassland reseeding, and one study in Australia found that numbers of frog species increased following restoration that included planting shrubs and trees (Action 849). However, one study in Canada found that following logging, amphibian abundance was lower or similar in forests that were planted and had herbicide treatment compared to those left to regenerate naturally, depending on species and forest age (Action 849).\n\nFor vegetation clearance, six studies in Australia, Estonia and the UK found that vegetation clearance increased numbers of frog species or increased, stabilized or maintained populations of natterjack toads (Action 761). However, one study in the UK found that vegetation clearance maintained a population of great crested newts for the first six years, but not in the longer term (Action 761).\n\nRegarding pond restoration, six studies in Denmark, Estonia, Italy and the UK found that pond restoration increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action 878). Three studies found that restored and created ponds were colonized by 1-7 species, with 6-65% of ponds colonized and 35% used for breeding (Action 878). For pond creation specifically, studies found that amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds, and amphibians used 64-100% and reproduced in 64-68% of created ponds (Action 869).\n\nFor wetland restoration, eight out of ten site comparison studies in Canada and the USA found that amphibian abundance, numbers of species and species composition were similar between restored and natural wetlands (Action 879). A global review found that in 89% of cases, restored and created wetlands had similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species compared to natural wetlands (Action 879).

    "relevant_summary": "Based on the available evidence, several management options are available to mitigate the impacts of timber harvesting on forest amphibian populations. Retaining riparian buffer strips during timber harvest is a key strategy, with twelve studies investigating its effectiveness (Action 747). Six replicated and/or controlled studies found mixed effects on abundance depending on species and buffer width, with one finding significantly higher amphibian abundance with buffers. Eleven studies comparing amphibian numbers in forest with riparian buffers to unharvested forest found six studies showing mixed effects depending on species or volume of existing downed wood, four finding similar abundance and species composition to unharvested forest, and two finding lower numbers of species and abundance than unharvested forest. Additionally, two of four replicated studies found that numbers of amphibian species and abundance were greater in wider riparian buffer strips. Alternative harvesting methods can also be employed instead of clearcutting, including patch retention harvesting (Action 330), selective or reduced impact logging (Action 3867), harvesting groups of trees or using thinning (Action 3868), and shelterwood harvesting (Action 3871). However, the effectiveness data for these alternative harvesting methods comes primarily from studies on butterflies and moths rather than amphibians specifically. Managing silviculture practices in plantations (Action 792) is also mentioned as a relevant approach. Planting riparian buffer strips was tested in one replicated, controlled study in the USA which found it did not increase amphibian abundance, numbers of species, or the ratio of adults to tadpoles (Action 819).",

    "relevant_summary": "The most beneficial actions for creating or restoring aquatic habitats for amphibians include pond creation, pond restoration, wetland creation and restoration, and specific pond management techniques. Creating ponds for amphibians is highly effective, with all 28 studies finding that amphibians used some or all created ponds, and amphibians established stable populations in 50-100% of created ponds (Action 869). Created ponds were used or colonized by up to 15 naturally colonizing species and up to 10 species that reproduced (Action 869). Pond restoration is also beneficial, with studies showing that pond restoration and creation increased numbers of amphibian species, maintained or increased populations, or increased pond occupancy and breeding success (Action 878). Wetland restoration proves effective, with restored wetlands having similar or higher amphibian abundance or numbers of species compared to natural wetlands in 89% of cases (Action 879). Creating wetlands results in similar numbers of amphibian species and abundance as natural wetlands, with four to 15 amphibian species using or colonizing created wetlands (Action 880). Specific pond management techniques include deepening, de-silting or re-profiling ponds, which resulted in establishment of breeding populations and increased populations of various amphibian species (Action 817). Regulating water levels helps maintain amphibian populations, with maintaining pond water levels enabling successful breeding (Action 833). Removing or controlling fish by drying out ponds increased numbers of amphibian species and breeding success (Action 826). Success factors for aquatic habitat creation include considerations of pond age, permanence, vegetation cover, surrounding landscape, distance to existing ponds, presence of fish, wetland size, proximity to source ponds, and wetland design (Actions 869, 880).",
