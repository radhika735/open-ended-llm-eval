Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings has been investigated in 32 studies, with six of seven studies finding these structures significantly decreased amphibian road deaths when used with barrier fencing. Closing roads during seasonal amphibian migrations was found to protect large numbers of amphibians during breeding migrations. Installing barriers and crossing structures along roads, such as fencing combined with crossing structures, has shown mixed results with some studies finding reduced mortalities while others found no reduction or possible increases. Using humans to assist migrating amphibians across roads has been implemented through patrol programs that moved thousands to half a million amphibians annually during breeding migrations, though population declines still occurred despite these efforts. Installing fences around existing culverts or underpasses has shown effectiveness in some cases, with two of three studies finding reduced mammal road mortality. Using signage to warn motorists about wildlife presence has shown mixed results, with some studies finding reduced road mortalities when signage was combined with other interventions like fencing and tunnels.",

Five found that culverts were used by less than 10% of amphibians or were not used. The use of culverts/tunnels was affected by diameter in three of six studies, with wider culverts used more, length in one of two studies, with long culverts avoided, lighting in all three studies, with mixed effects, substrate in three of six studies, with natural substrates used more, presence of water in two of three studies, with mixed effects, entrance location in one and tunnel climate in one study.\\nSix studies (including one replicated, controlled study) in Canada, Spain, the Netherlands and USA investigated the use of culverts with flowing water and found that they were used by amphibians, or rarely used by salamanders or not used, and were used more or the same amount as dry culverts.\\nCertain culvert designs were not suitable for amphibians; one-way tunnels with vertical entry chutes resulted in high mortality of common toads and condensation deposits from steel culverts had very high metal concentrations.
