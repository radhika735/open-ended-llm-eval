    "relevant_summary": "According to the evidence found, shelterwood harvesting compared to clearcutting resulted in higher, similar or initially higher and then similar salamander abundance (Action 851). A meta-analysis of 24 studies in North America found that partial harvest, which included shelterwood harvesting with three other types, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 851). However, compared to no harvesting, shelterwood harvesting decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition in two of three studies (Action 851).\n\nFor harvesting groups of trees instead of clearcutting, three studies in the USA found that this practice did not result in higher amphibian or salamander abundance compared to clearcutting (Action 844). The same meta-analysis found that partial harvest, which included harvesting groups or individual trees, thinning and shelterwood harvesting, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 844). When compared to no harvesting, harvesting trees in small groups significantly decreased salamander abundance and changed species composition (Action 844).\n\nRegarding thinning trees within forests, five studies comparing amphibians in thinned to unharvested forest found mixed effects of thinning on abundance, depending on amphibian species and time since harvest (Action 852). The meta-analysis found that partial harvest, which included thinning with three other types, decreased salamander populations (Action 852). When comparing thinned to clearcut forest, four studies found higher amphibian abundance or a less negative overall response in thinned forest, though effects varied by species, life stage and time since harvest (Action 852). The meta-analysis found that partial harvest, including thinning, resulted in smaller reductions in salamander populations than clearcutting (Action 852).",

    "relevant_summary": "Several interventions are available to reduce amphibian mortality caused by roads. Installing culverts or tunnels as road crossings is effective, with six of seven studies finding that these structures significantly decreased amphibian road deaths, particularly when combined with barrier fencing (Action 884). These crossing structures are used by 15-85% of amphibians or 3-15 species, with 23-100% of culverts/tunnels being utilized by amphibians. The effectiveness depends on design features including diameter (wider culverts used more), length (long culverts avoided), lighting, substrate type (natural substrates preferred), and presence of water (Action 884).\n\nInstalling barrier fencing along roads is another effective intervention, with seven of eight studies finding that barrier fencing with culverts decreased amphibian road deaths, provided that fence length and material were effective (Action 756). Barriers need to be at least 0.6 m high to prevent certain species like green frogs and leopard frogs from climbing over, though some treefrogs and common toads can still climb over barriers during breeding migrations (Action 756).\n\nRoad closures during seasonal amphibian migration provide protection, with studies in Germany finding that large numbers of amphibians were protected from death during breeding migrations at road closure sites, especially when combined with assisted crossings and barrier fences (Action 842).\n\nCombined approaches using barriers and crossing structures show mixed results for reptiles and amphibians, with some studies finding reduced road mortalities while others found limited effectiveness (Action 3507). Warning signage alone has limited effectiveness for amphibians, with mixed results when used in isolation but better outcomes when combined with other interventions like fencing and tunnels (Action 3524).",

One study also found that the addition of fencing around crossing structures did not affect the number of reptile crossings. Three studies (including one replicated and one before-and-after study and one review) in the USA and Spain found that wildlife crossing structures with fencing were used by gopher tortoises and 12 snake species, American alligators and lacertid lizards. One study also found that an American alligator did not use the wildlife crossing structure. Two before-and-after studies (including one controlled study) in Canada found mixed effects of installing roadside fencing and culverts on road use by turtles and snakes. One replicated study in Spain found that use of different crossing structures depended on species group. One replicated study in Australia found that reptiles used wildlife underpasses or culverts for only 1% of road crossings.
