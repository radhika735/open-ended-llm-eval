However, no studies were found that evaluated the effects of these alternative approaches on marine mammal populations.\n\nFor additional context, action 3531 found that limiting vessel speeds was effective for reptiles, with vessels travelling at lower speeds causing fewer catastrophic injuries to artificial loggerhead turtle shells and fewer boat-related injuries to spectacled caiman in waterways with enforced speed limits.",

Action 2912 identifies that legally protecting areas where climate change impacts are predicted to be less severe has not been evaluated in any studies for marine and freshwater mammal populations. Similarly, action 2222 shows that creating marine protected areas or setting legal protection levels where natural climate refugia occur to promote species persistence and recovery facing climate change has not been evaluated in any studies. Action 2913 indicates that establishing networks of legally protected areas also lacks direct evaluation studies for marine and freshwater mammal populations. However, action 2915 provides some evidence on the effectiveness of legally protecting habitat for marine and freshwater mammals, showing that four studies found varied results: one study in the North Atlantic Ocean found Mediterranean monk seal populations increased during eight years after legal protection, while a North Sea study found bottlenose dolphin populations remained similar in size before and after protection. Additionally, a South Pacific Ocean study found higher survival rates for Hector's dolphins after coastal legal protection, and a Port River estuary study showed reduced human-caused strandings of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins after legal protection was established.",

Action 2895 found no studies that evaluated the effects of removing litter from marine and freshwater environments on marine and freshwater mammal populations. Action 2932 mentioned Amazon river dolphins in captivity but found that most captive-born Amazon river dolphins did not survive in captivity (USA, China, Indonesia and Venezuela). The multimedia campaign evidence from Action 1571 showed successful conservation education programs for various primate species in different countries, but did not specifically address marine mammals or plastic pollution. Action 3682 demonstrated that education and awareness campaigns could be effective for reptile conservation, with examples showing reduced killing and increased survival rates, but again did not address marine mammals or plastic pollution specifically.",
