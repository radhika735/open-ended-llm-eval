    "relevant_summary": "Based on the evidence, sowing native grass and forbs together (action 3432) is the most consistently effective method for establishing native forbs in degraded grasslands. This approach increased forb species richness in 71% of cases and increased forb cover in multiple studies across different regions. For improved results, sowing seeds at a higher density (action 3405) can enhance forb species richness and cover compared to standard seeding rates. While adding topsoil before seeding (action 3420) increased plant species richness and sown species biomass, this method may be more costly than direct seeding approaches. Planting grassland plants as seedlings (action 3399) showed high success rates for forbs (83% of cases) but requires more labor and materials than seeding methods. Use of erosion blankets (action 3431) and irrigation (action 3430) showed mixed results and add additional costs. Direct seeding of native forbs, potentially at higher densities, emerges as the most cost-effective approach based on its consistent positive effects on forb establishment across multiple studies without requiring expensive additional treatments.",

While adding topsoil before seeding (action 3420) increased plant species richness and sown species biomass, this method may be more costly than direct seeding approaches. Planting grassland plants as seedlings (action 3399) showed high success rates for forbs (83% of cases) but requires more labor and materials than seeding methods. Use of erosion blankets (action 3431) and irrigation (action 3430) showed mixed results and add additional costs. Direct seeding of native forbs, potentially at higher densities, emerges as the most cost-effective approach based on its consistent positive effects on forb establishment across multiple studies without requiring expensive additional treatments.\",\n  \"action_ids\": [\n    \"3432\",\n    \"3405\",\n    \"3420\",\n    \"3399\",\n    \"3431\",\n    \"3430\"\n  ]\n}"
