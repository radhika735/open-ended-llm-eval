However, information on the effects of each method was available. Adding compost was found to increase soil organic matter (1362), nutrients (1362), and microbial biomass (1362) in several studies. It may also enhance soil stability (1362) and, in some instances, crop yields (1346). On the other hand, some studies noted an increase in greenhouse gas emissions (1362) and nutrient runoff (1377) with compost application. Growing cover crops, particularly in Mediterranean-type climates, was shown to increase soil organic matter and carbon (1345, 898). They also improved soil structure, nutrient retention, and nitrogen levels (898, 1345). Additionally, cover crops were found to boost microbial biomass (898, 1345), reduce soil erosion (1345), and could increase the yield of the following crop (898). Incorporating leys into crop rotation may reduce the need for fertilizer for subsequent crops (900).",
